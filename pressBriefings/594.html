Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:41 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I welcome you to the White House today.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have several announcements here at the top.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First of all, as has just recently been reported, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of big news.\xc2\xa0 In October, for the first time in nearly two decades, domestic oil production, which is at a 24-year high, surpassed foreign oil imports, which are at a 17-year low.\xc2\xa0 This milestone is a result of both increased production and administration policies like increased fuel-economy standards that cut oil consumption, cut carbon pollution, and cut consumer bills.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I have some visual aids here.\xc2\xa0 The first chart shows what the Energy and Information Administration has found.\xc2\xa0 For the first time since the 1990s, the monthly average of U.S. crude oil net imports will be less than the amount of crude oil we produce domestically during the same period.\xc2\xa0 This transformation is driven by three primary factors.\xc2\xa0 First, the improving efficiency of our cars and trucks, sparked by the President\xe2\x80\x99s historic fuel-economy standards.\xc2\xa0 Second, continuing catalytic investments in advanced vehicles and fuels, and increased biofuel production.\xc2\xa0 Third, increasing domestic oil production.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Taken together, these factors not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil but work to reduce overall carbon pollution in our communities, as is shown in this second chart.\xc2\xa0 As you can see, carbon pollution from the transportation sector was the lowest it\xe2\x80\x99s been in more than a decade in 2012.\xc2\xa0 Improved efficiency in the transportation sector as well as deployment of alternative fuel technologies like electric vehicles and biofuels are driving this reduction in carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The final chart underscores the important point that we do not need to choose between growing the economy and cutting pollution.\xc2\xa0 While CO2 emissions are dropping, our economy is not slowing and our GDP continues to grow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s climate action plan will spark innovation across a wide variety of energy technologies, resulting in cleaner forms of American-made energy.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s plan will also help families cut energy waste, lowering their gas and utility bills.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a significant milestone, a reflection of the President\xe2\x80\x99s all-of-the-above approach to energy production as well as his commitment to reducing carbon emissions.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s rather remarkable if you look at the trajectory over the course of the last two decades that we are now importing less foreign oil than we are producing here at home, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that is very welcome news indeed.</p>\n<p>The second announcement I have at the top is that today at 3:00 p.m. in the Oval Office the President will sign H.R. 2094:\xc2\xa0 The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, which amends the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Asthma Treatment Grants Program and other asthma programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services in order to encourage schools to plan for severe allergic reactions.\xc2\xa0 There will be a photo spray at the top of that signing ceremony.</p>\n<p>Finally, we applaud congressional leaders in both the House and Senate for introducing a bill today that would help realize the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision of high-quality preschool for every American child.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s notable that the House version of the bill includes a Republican co-sponsor.\xc2\xa0 Parents deserve safe places for their children to learn, and we know that for America to succeed in the 21st century, we will need the most dynamic, educated workforce in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is no better down payment towards that goal than a great early start to education.\xc2\xa0 Studies show that every dollar invested in early learning and development programs save as much as $7 down the road in higher earnings that yield more revenue and lower government spending on social services and crime prevention.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why governors from both parties are investing in early education at the state level.\xc2\xa0 But even so, most 4-year-olds are not in a high-quality public preschool program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is an investment we need to make at the federal level, too, and one that the President has a plan to pay for -- with a small increase to the federal tax on cigarettes, which would also discourage kids from smoking and benefit their health.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we can and must do more to provide every child an opportunity, a great start in life, and this bill is a crucial step in that direction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Education, of course, cannot stop in the early years, and that is why, as Valerie Jarrett announced last night, next month the President will host a summit that will produce -- that will bring together, rather, college presidents, the private sector, and others to focus on increasing college access and completion for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\xc2\xa0 This will include ensuring that we reach disadvantaged students early enough so that they are on a path to succeed in college and in their careers, and to help them wherever possible to match to the colleges where they are most likely to succeed.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a lot of evidence out there about what works, and we want to use this event as an opportunity to see how we can scale up the most successful approaches to helping students reach and succeed in college.\xc2\xa0 And this will complement our efforts to address the issue of college cost for all students by focusing on their mission of a quality education at an affordable price.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Early next month.\xc2\xa0 April, early next month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, I will go to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple things on health care.\xc2\xa0 The House is expected to vote Friday on Congressman Upton\'s bill to continue to provide current health coverage to Americans even though it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the new health law\'s standards.\xc2\xa0 You voiced your opposition -- or the White House opposition to that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering if there\'s something -- is there an alternative that the White House will provide to Democrats who seem eager if not desperate for something that they can support, if not this Upton bill?\xc2\xa0 And do you have a view on Senator Landrieu\'s bill today now that it\'s gaining more Democratic support?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 The President has always been eager to work with lawmakers of both parties who are sincerely interested in improving the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Major reforms like this, the past tells us, are upgraded and improved along the way through legislative action.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as I said, has always been interested in and has expressed that interest in working with lawmakers of both parties who envision a way to make legislative fixes so that improvements can be introduced.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The problems I mentioned yesterday with the bill that you cited in the House are that, intentionally or not, the bill would not just address the problem that has been discussed with cancellation notices for those in the individual market, but would essentially allow insurers to sell new plans that were substandard that did not meet the minimum benefits standard of the Affordable Care Act, and thereby potentially undermine the central promise of the Affordable Care Act, which is that Americans ought to be able to have certainty that when they purchase coverage, they are going to receive minimum benefits and quality and affordable health care.</p>\n<p>So, having said that -- and this goes to your second question about the work that Senator Landrieu and others are undertaking -- the President does want to, and is discussing with lawmakers ways that we can make improvements that go to the problem that he talked about with Chuck last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition to that, the President has instructed his team to come up with options for him to review.\xc2\xa0 And you can expect a decision from him and an announcement from him sooner rather than later on options that we can take to address the problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing here with regards to those individuals who have had their individual insurance plans canceled because of the transition to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re working on all levels to address these problems, and we welcome sincere efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly agree with Democrats that the problems we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with the website, the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that have been caused by the gaps and holes in the legislation that the President mentioned need to be fixed and need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 Because the purpose of the Affordable Care Act is to create that system where there is quality, affordable health insurance available to every American.\xc2\xa0 And it is important to remember, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about efforts largely undertaken by Republicans that don\xe2\x80\x99t try to fix problems or improve the Affordable Care Act, but try to eliminate it altogether or sabotage it, that the alternative they are proposing is the status quo.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There has been a great deal of focus, deservedly so, on the problems with the rollout of the marketplaces, but we should not lose sight of the fact that there was a reason that this President, as so many presidents before him, pursued health care reform.\xc2\xa0 The system was broken.\xc2\xa0 It is broken.\xc2\xa0 It needs reform.\xc2\xa0 It needs fixing.\xc2\xa0 It needs to be better so that the American people can count on affordable, quality health care as a right and not a privilege.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So many Democrats see that as a failed promise -- the idea that you could keep your health care, your insurance.\xc2\xa0 And so is there something that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to rally around by the end of this week when they face -- when they have to actually vote on something that the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that proposed legislation that actually causes more problems than it fixes is the right way to go.\xc2\xa0 But we are interested in other avenues that actually address the problems identified.\xc2\xa0 And as I just said, the President tasked his team, as he mentioned last week, to come up with proposed solutions.\xc2\xa0 And you can expect us to be announcing something sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly then, last week, the President, in Dallas, speaking about the health care website, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the end of this month, we anticipate that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be working the way it is supposed to.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe expect it to be functioning properly and effectively for the vast majority of Americans by the end of the month.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And today, Todd Park, the White House Chief Technology Officer, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that it would be fully functional by November 30th but said it was a goal.\xc2\xa0 So the President gets updated on this daily, and I wondered, what is today\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of November 30th?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be functioning?\xc2\xa0 And when you say \xe2\x80\x9cfor a vast majority of Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help everybody, you could still be leaving millions of Americans not getting access to that website.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 As Jeff Zients, who is managing this effort, said publicly to the press, we are working 24/7 making changes and improvements to the website, and it is our belief that we are on track so that by November 30th, healthcare.gov will be working smoothly for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Jeff said, and that remains the case today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I think Todd Park said in his testimony, and others have said and I have said, there are still problems that need to be addressed, even as we work through a punch list, or the team, the tech team works through a punch list of issues that need to be resolved.</p>\n<p>The fact is, on November 13th, we are not where we will be and want to be by November 30th.\xc2\xa0 But it remains the case that we believe the site will be working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 That was the frame that Jeff Zients talked about when he first established this goal, and we believe we\xe2\x80\x99re on track.\xc2\xa0 We make assessments all the time.\xc2\xa0 Today, we are confident that we are on track to achieve that.\xc2\xa0 If that changes, we will certainly let you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me also be clear, as I said yesterday, as with any major website that\xe2\x80\x99s complex, as this one is, it can be working smoothly for the vast majority of users and there can still be individuals who experience problems.\xc2\xa0 So I do not doubt that if we meet this goal and it is working smoothly for the vast majority of users, that there will be stories of people who experience delays or difficulties.\xc2\xa0 But it is our conviction that we can, with the fixes that are being implemented, reach that goal by November 30th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, the purpose of this is to ensure that Americans who are interested in reviewing their options and purchasing quality, affordable health insurance through the marketplaces are able to do so in a satisfactory way.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no question that from the launch date on October 1st, the performance of the website has been far less than satisfactory.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that it\'s important to note -- and CMS has released some of this information, but I can do it from here too -- that this progress that is being made every day is measured against metrics that focus on response time and error rate and site stability.\xc2\xa0 Progress on these metrics are moving in the right direction -- pages are loading faster and error rates are down\xc2\xa0 -- and we expect to see more progress each week.\xc2\xa0 On response time, we have cut the average wait time of eight seconds for pages across the site to load to less than one second.\xc2\xa0 That\'s progress.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not where we need to be, but that is progress.</p>\n<p>On error rate, we have reduced the error rate -- the frequency on a per-page basis of system timeouts or failures that prevented the user from advancing -- from 6 percent to 2 percent as of last week.\xc2\xa0 That was announced last week.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you today that that error rate is now below 1 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\'s progress.\xc2\xa0 It is not where we need to be.\xc2\xa0 It is not where we expect to be on November 30th, but that is progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On site stability, as you know, the system has gone down with some consistency since it was launched on October 1st.\xc2\xa0 But stability has greatly improved.\xc2\xa0 I think that has been noted by people who cover it.\xc2\xa0 And we are implementing fixes and changes every day that help improve stability, as well as error rate and response time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is the kind of stuff that often CMS releases, but I\'m trying to give you some context here so that it\'s not just a goal that we\'ll all evaluate on November 30th as to whether we\'ve made it or not, that there are specific metrics by which progress is measured and there is measurable progress to report.\xc2\xa0 And there are software fixes being made, hardware fixes being made.\xc2\xa0 And each day, we get closer to where we need to be.</p>\n<p>Jeff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on a separate topic -- Iran.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke to Prime Minister Cameron and President Hollande today and recently.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States preparing a new package or a new deal along with its allies for the next round of talks?\xc2\xa0 And if the next round of talks also proves to be unsuccessful, would that be the time for harsher sanctions or a new round of sanctions against Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jeff, we have not gotten into a great deal of specificity about the proposals or the substance of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 We have said -- and it remains absolutely the case -- that the P5-plus-1 presented a unified proposal, which was not accepted by Iran.\xc2\xa0 It is also true that the negotiations in Geneva were serious and that progress was made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And while an agreement was not reached on this first phase that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, it is evident that the comprehensive set of sanctions that have been implemented, coupled with the efforts to isolate Tehran that we have pursued, have had a dramatic effect on the Iranian government\xe2\x80\x99s view of its dilemma here.\xc2\xa0 And they are engaging in serious negotiations about how they can verifiably comply with their international obligations in a way that allows the P5-plus-1 and all of our allies and partners, in every country in the region and world, to be confident that Iran cannot and will not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is the goal.\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday, it is the right goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President takes no option off the table, but it is absolutely his responsibility as Commander-in-Chief to pursue the possibility of preventing Iran from achieving or acquiring a nuclear weapon through a peaceful negotiation as opposed to the alternative.\xc2\xa0 The alternative remains on the table, but it is far preferable, if possible, to achieve an agreement that is verifiable, transparent, and the product of concrete steps with Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we are pursuing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moving back to health care, is the White House encouraging Nancy-Ann DeParle and Jeanne Lambrew to testify about Obamacare?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the congressmen and women are asking for that they say they\xe2\x80\x99ve been denied.\xc2\xa0 Also, there was a meeting between Obama administration officials and House Democrats about the health care law.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just say in general on -- I think you saw today again with Todd Park testifying that there has been an enormous amount of cooperation with oversight, multiple committees looking into this, many senior officials testifying, witnesses being interviewed, documents being provided.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And Todd Park did go up and, as you know, testify this morning.\xc2\xa0 And I think as I noted yesterday -- it bears repeating today -- that Todd Park is working 24/7 on the efforts to fix the website, and if the focus of congressional committees and their chairmen is to get the website fixed, they would have been more successful in pursuing that goal -- if it is their goal -- if they had allowed Todd Park to continue that work and for him to come up, as we made abundantly clear he would, in December to testify.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 My last follow-up was there was a meeting between Obama administration officials and House Democrats about the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us who was present from the White House at that meeting and what types of assurances are being made to House Democrats, following up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, that this will be solved and that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to hurt them in 2014?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe David Simas was at that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I can find out who else was there.\xc2\xa0 So the meeting took place, and these are reflective of the kinds of meetings and the many meetings that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had on the Affordable Care Act and its implementation, and the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced with the website and other challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that the frustration that Democrats who strongly support the Affordable Care Act and who strongly believe that it is the right thing to do and needs to be implemented so that it can benefit their constituents and the American people is similar to the frustration the President feels.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is satisfied.\xc2\xa0 Nobody who supports health care reform and supports successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act is satisfied with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out of the website and with some of these other problems.</p>\n<p>Now, there are those who are clearly rooting for failure because their preference has always been that there not be any reform, that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what kind of assurances can be made to Democrats, people on your team right now, that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to hurt their election chances next year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there are two things that I can say in response to that.\xc2\xa0 One, the President, and everybody else here, looks at this as a matter of policy first and politics second, because the policy here is what matters.\xc2\xa0 Democrats supported health care reform against mighty resistance from Republicans, and it is absolutely vital that we get it right; that we do everything we can, as we are doing, to make sure that the marketplaces function and that the American people get access to quality, affordable health insurance as promised by the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s on the individual level.</p>\n<p>And then, on the broader, macroeconomic level, that the Affordable Care Act continues to deliver on the promise of bending the cost curve, producing savings within our health care system, reflected as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the fact that health care inflation has been lower in the last three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed and at any time in the previous half-century.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the assurance we can give them -- that we are working every day and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them, and as I mentioned earlier, talking to lawmakers about ideas they have to help improve this situation so that we deliver on the policy promise.\xc2\xa0 And the policy promise stands in stark contrast, if fulfilled, with the alternative, and that goes to the politics.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to move, because yesterday I think we spent almost 45 minutes on the front row.\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions for you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 One, when you say sooner rather than later, as far the President announcing some sort of administrative plan here, would sooner be before Friday when the House votes on the Upton bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sooner rather than later.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned yesterday, when the President says -- or asks his team to work quickly to come up with policy options, people respond quickly to that request.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, the meeting today with House Democrats -- this wasn\'t a group of moderates in swing districts that were taking issue with what David Simas and Mike Hash were telling them; it was Anna Eshoo from California, from Silicon Valley, a good friend of Nancy Pelosi; Mike Doyle, who was a big interlocutor to get Catholics on board with the original vote on ACA, somebody who is a big supporter.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about a slide in Democratic support here, something that might be irreversible if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get things fixed soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is concerned about getting implementation of the Affordable Care Act right, which is a concern shared by the members you just mentioned, and by every Democratic member of the House, I trust, and every Democratic member of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It might, perhaps, be shared by even some Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see.</p>\n<p>The fact is, it\'s the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 It provides exceptional benefits to the American people, and it needs to be gotten right.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to political support, I would simply say what I just said earlier, which is that politics follows policy here.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is -- and I know that a lot of attention is being paid to polls, and I\'m not discounting that at all, and I know that the current situation is turbulent when it comes to the problems that we\'ve seen with the implementation of the marketplaces -- but it was just three or four weeks ago that I stood in this room and took questions about whether or not the Republican Party was in terminal decline in the wake of the decision by House Republicans to shut the government down over their opposition to Obamacare.</p>\n<p>So politics is a fluid business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re a --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make that assertion, reporters did.\xc2\xa0 And what I said in response to those questions was what the President believes, which is that this country thrives with a vibrant two-party system, and that we need a strong two-party system in which both parties are trying to achieve compromise on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President believes.</p>\n<p>So the whole point is that politics are fluid.\xc2\xa0 The policy is what matters.\xc2\xa0 The policy and the benefits are what matters.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\'re focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'m going to get to ABC.\xc2\xa0 Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Elizabeth Warren was saying today that with Republicans filibustering a candidate for the D.C. Court of Appeals yesterday, they are effectively trying to nullify the results of the last election and seriously looking at going for the nuclear option.\xc2\xa0 Would you like to comment on whether you think they\'re going that far?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The opposition and obstruction that we\'ve seen in the Senate to highly qualified nominees to this court is highly regrettable.\xc2\xa0 The reasons thrown up for that opposition are insincere at best and laughable in general.\xc2\xa0 This is the same court which had a smaller workload to which Republicans gladly voted for President George W. Bush\'s nominees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So to cite caseload, in an effort obviously to prevent the duly elected President of the United States from appointing his nominees to this court, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody takes seriously -- I don\'t think anybody in this room, with the possible exception of a handful, take seriously.</p>\n<p>And we will defer to Leader Reid on the actions that ought to be taken in response.\xc2\xa0 But it is shocking, really, when you think about the nominees that have been blocked through filibuster, how qualified they are and how rightfully they ought to be able to sit on that court, because the President of the United States has nominated them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I noted -- I don\'t know if others saw -- there was an amazing piece about the last nominee, Ms. Millett, who was filibustered from a military reservist who was represented by her in a discrimination suit against his employer who discriminated against him because of his service as a reservist and his deployment.\xc2\xa0 And she is a military spouse, and she took up that case and she won in the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the kind of representation that ought to be on that court.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to fight for the President\'s highly qualified nominees to be confirmed by the Senate as the Constitution prescribes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to Speaker Boehner\'s comments today that the House would not take up a comprehensive immigration bill, that that would not go to -- would not do a conference committee on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the Speaker has said -- and I\'m just reading what he was quoted as having said -- that the House would not take up the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a procedural reason for why that couldn\'t happen anyway.\xc2\xa0 But what the House could do this week is take up its own comprehensive immigration reform bill.\xc2\xa0 There\'s one that the House Democrats have put on the table that reflects the President\'s principles, reflects the principles put forward in the bipartisan Senate bill and that we strongly believe would pass the House with a substantial majority, including voters from both parties if the Speaker were to bring it to the floor for a vote.</p>\n<p>I noted that the Speaker said that he has instructed members of his team to devise principles on immigration reform, and I think that\'s a welcome step.\xc2\xa0 It seems a little bit late in the game to be developing principles on this substantial issue and priority for American businesses, for labor, for faith communities, for law enforcement communities.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, put forward principles on immigration reform a number of years ago and those principles are reflected in the Senate bipartisan bill.</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter remains that however they do it, the House ought to move forward with a process that will result in comprehensive immigration reform becoming law.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the middle class, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for business, and it\xe2\x80\x99d be good for the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 And I know that you know that every Republican leader you talk to agrees with that sentiment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is more than willing to assist in delivering that benefit to, if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about politics, to the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 And every conservative Republican who wants to explain to his or her constituents why it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do has just ample evidence that CEOs and other business leaders can provide to them, and economists can provide to them, about why comprehensive immigration reform is the right thing to do from a conservative and economic perspective.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this will happen this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it could happen this year.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the House is the obstacle, or the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And we, as I said, believe that if there were the will in the House to act quickly and decisively on comprehensive immigration reform, it could be achieved and it would receive a broad bipartisan vote in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been helpful giving out some CMS numbers today, can you tell us how many people have enrolled for health care through the federal exchanges?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not have that information, but I believe that CMS will have an announcement later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And assuming the numbers will be low, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve told us many times, how much of a reason -- I know the reasons; it\xe2\x80\x99s first month, sixth months and all of that, people do it late -- how much will the numbers be deflated because of the problems with the website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can only tell you that we fully expect that the numbers will be even lower than anticipated because of the significant challenges caused by the website.\xc2\xa0 I would defer you to CMS and the briefing that they\xe2\x80\x99ll give on the numbers when they present them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we learned from GAO today, at the hearing in the House, that the website development cost, in the words of the GAO, north of $600 million.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that number?\xc2\xa0 It seems like --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that report.\xc2\xa0 I can refer you to HHS and CMS for how the contracts work for the development of the website.\xc2\xa0 I know that the teams now that have been brought in are working under existing contracts in an effort to fix the problems that the website has and to continue to work down the punch list, as I described earlier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President think that taxpayers got their money\xe2\x80\x99s worth out of that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly thinks that the website has functioned far below expectations and is wholly unsatisfied with its performance thus far, and he believes that the American people, and most specifically those Americans who are seeking insurance through the marketplaces and quality, affordable insurance for many of them for the first time, deserve better.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has insisted, in very stark terms, to his team that they get this right.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re working 24/7 to get it right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, more than $600 [million] spent so far; is there any sense of how much more is going to be spent to get this right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For those kinds of questions, I refer you to CMS and HHS.\xc2\xa0 Again, I believe early on in this process, when we began putting together the tech surge and the team of people who are working on the fixes -- they, HHS, that we made clear that those individuals who are part of that effort are working under existing contracts.</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Sebelius, we now know, during the briefing is participating --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Brianna, can I ask your indulgence for one moment?\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to bring up one other point in answer to Jon, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, and it is often neglected as a data point by critics of the Affordable Care Act, that, as scored by the CBO, the Affordable Care Act will significantly reduce the deficit both in the first 10 years and truly significantly in the second 10 years -- as scored by the CBO, a nonpartisan body that Republicans and Democrats frequently cite and I\xe2\x80\x99m citing today.</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re expecting the announcement of enrollment numbers today, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President has seen them, is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with him about this today.\xc2\xa0 So the President is regularly updated, so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen the final figures.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along is and was true, which is that this is data coming in from a lot of sources; it has to be scrubbed, it has to be checked so that when it\xe2\x80\x99s released, that it is as accurate as possible.\xc2\xa0 So what I can\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge deal.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we should wait until the thing to which you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for a reaction is released publicly, and then we can talk about what it means.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you come out again and talk to us about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be done for the day after this, but one never knows.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe the President will come out and talk to us.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You never know.\xc2\xa0 But my point, Brianna, is I promise you that no one will be satisfied with the numbers because they will be below what we sought prior to the launch.\xc2\xa0 And while it is fully expected and was fully expected that enrollment would be low in the first month, because that is the historic experience here with Massachusetts being the best example to look to, the lowness will be exacerbated because of the significant problems with the website and the website obviously was a major avenue through which people would be able to enroll.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed on this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Brianna, I just said that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about this today so I want to be careful about blithely stating yes.\xc2\xa0 I suspect the answer is yes, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 And again, final numbers would be dependent upon the sort of final scrub.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we talk about the punch list?\xc2\xa0 Talking to sources, it sounds like the punch list is comprised of priorities as well as defects, that some of the defects don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily meet the threshold of making the website not operational.\xc2\xa0 Why not, in the interest of transparency, just put out the punch list?\xc2\xa0 Because right now you have Secretary Sebelius having said that there is hundreds of items.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like this huge avalanche of problems, but maybe in the interest of transparency, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make sense to put out the punch list?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, I was struck by this when a reporter who covers this very closely late in the day was unaware of some of the information that we were giving that reporter yesterday that had been public from CMS last week about the data.\xc2\xa0 So we are making information about the progress being made and the metrics that are being used, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that in the regular briefings that CMS has been doing that more data than I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to provide is being provided and will be provided.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right that there are basically -- on the software side and the hardware side there are priority problems that are being addressed as priorities, because fixing them will have the greatest impact on error rate and stability and delay time, which are the principal problems that need to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 But there are a whole host of other small issues that are also sort of on another list that are addressed when the site goes down for maintenance, for regular maintenance overnight that are addressed as well as the major priority list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re sort of I think sketching out a scenario of what the website functionality may look like come November 30th when you said some people will be experiencing some delays still.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just guessing that, as is the case with every major website that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever used, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a perfect experience for everyone.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I want to anticipate for you that even if we meet our goal, which we\'re assessing regularly the progress toward it, of having the website working smoothly for the vast majority of users by November 30th, that we can both meet that goal and have individual experiences reported back to us that are less than satisfactory.\xc2\xa0 And I think that those will be tackled in the same manner that the more serious and higher volume problems have been tackled heretofore.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is the goal?\xc2\xa0 When you say "vast majority," I mean, it sounds like the people who are actually on the -- or I understand it to be the case, that the people who are actually on the ground working out the technical fixes for healthcare.gov don\'t know what that means.\xc2\xa0 Is that rhetoric or is it an operational goal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it reflects -- and I would point you to briefers at CMS for more details, including Jeff Zients, who has addressed this -- the realistic goal of the site working as it was intended to, i.e. smoothly, for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that mean, the "vast majority?"</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it means what I\'m saying, which is that we do not and would not set a goal, and should never have set a goal --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there has to be a number, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a number attached to that.\xc2\xa0 I think that, again, it would be hard to pinpoint when you\'re getting anecdotal cases of individuals who have not had a satisfactory experience what that percentage represents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except you\'re citing -- I mean, Park is on the Hill today citing how many people can go on the website.\xc2\xa0 You know the number of how many people can --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, but today is November 13th.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is in the goal that we\'re setting, we know we have a vast majority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the number goal for the vast majority?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s a number goal of concurrent users, if -- that\'s what Todd Park was talking about today, I believe, in his testimony.\xc2\xa0 And there are number goals in terms of volume capacity.\xc2\xa0 And I think others were testifying or someone else was testifying about the number of people who are registering or signing up in an hour.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is no number?\xc2\xa0 So there is no number goal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Brianna, I think that, again, we\'re talking about November 30th and we\'re talking about having the website function effectively for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m being I think very clear here, as I was yesterday, by saying that that does not mean and nor should you or do we expect it to mean that there will not be, even if we meet that goal, any individuals out there who didn\'t have the website time out or didn\'t have an eight-second delay for one page loading, because that happens as it does I think for all of us on websites every day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it meet the President\'s rubric when you\'re talking about some people experiencing delay?\xc2\xa0 So, presumably, because you won\'t commit to a number, that could be a sizable number.\xc2\xa0 Does that meet with what he said a week ago --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it would be the other side of a vast majority.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- where he said we can anticipate that it is going to be working the way it is supposed to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, for the vast majority of users.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t say that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 It should be working the way it\'s supposed to be working.\xc2\xa0 And that means that for the vast majority of users, it\'s working smoothly, they have a satisfactory experience -- that the wait times are not problematic, that the pages move through quickly, they don\'t get error messages, and they\'re able to shop and successfully register and enroll in a way that allows them to feel comfortable with the process.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, obviously, because this in part has to do with individuals having an experience with a website and its interface, some of the factors of satisfaction are hard to measure.\xc2\xa0 So we have metrics that try to address that in terms of error rates and load rates.</p>\n<p>So they\'re focusing on those technical fixes that will improve the experience and have already, as I noted, improve the experience for users thus far.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you were talking about when the President would soon announce what he thinks is the solution for the folks who got cancellation --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But you made clear that he would like himself to explain what that is.\xc2\xa0 At that time --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think -- we are going to, at the President\'s direction -- as he made clear in his interview with NBC, he\'s tasked his team with coming up with proposals that would address the problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, so he might --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m just not making a scheduling announcement about either specifically when, except that it\'s sooner rather than later, or how those proposals will be put forward.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you that the President has made very clear to his team that he wants these proposals reviewed, and then he\'ll make a decision about how to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And then, again, in the context of questions about Senator Landrieu and other potential legislative remedies, we are in regular conversation with lawmakers who are sincerely focused on trying to address the gaps and holes in the legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, back to the land of vague, then I want to move forward to the question I was going to ask, which is, Jeff Zients has been very clear in the calls that he\'s been on that, realistically, they have encountered many unexpected things that have occurred, even though progress has been made.\xc2\xa0 My question is, is the President prepared at some point this month to talk publicly about the potential that folks will not be able to actually get and pay for insurance that they need by January 1 for whatever host of reasons?\xc2\xa0 Would he be able to say, I have contingency plans, or here\'s what we --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, as I said earlier, we continue to believe that, with the progress we are making, that we are on track to meet the goal for the website to be functioning smoothly for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you right now that as of today, we are on track.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll also say that if that changes and we are no longer on track, we will tell you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been speculation hedged and vaguely sourced that we\xe2\x80\x99re not on track -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t, I will tell you or we will tell you that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it goes to some of the questions that I addressed earlier about what the purpose of all this is, which is getting the implementation of this policy right so that the benefits that accrue to the American people are delivered to the American people who need them and who will benefit from them.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- as we have in taking ownership of the wholly unacceptable problems with the website, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be candid about where we are.\xc2\xa0 And where we are today is we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to meet that goal.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as we all know, the U.S. is, along with many other nations, sending assistance to the typhoon-ravaged Philippines.\xc2\xa0 Have the cuts resulting from the sequester affected the ability of the U.S. military to deliver this type of assistance not only abroad but here in America as well when disaster strikes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are engaged in a comprehensive effort to provide direct assistance to the Philippines as they deal with the aftermath of this horrific storm, historic storm, and typhoon.\xc2\xa0 I talked about some of the details, but the airlift of USAID heavy-duty plastic sheeting and hygiene kits arrived in Manila yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Those supplies were delivered to Tacloban today -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the seriously affected areas.\xc2\xa0 DOD and USAID are coordinating closely and preparing to airlift additional U.S. relief supplies and food aid to Tacloban in coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The USS George Washington carrier strike group is scheduled to arrive on November 14th, tomorrow, which will help expand search-and-rescue operations, provide medical care, and logistical support, and serve as a platform for helicopters that can move supplies to remote areas.\xc2\xa0 And we can provide you with greater information.</p>\n<p>In answer to your question about the budgets, we are deploying all the resources that we can to this effort.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to DOD about the effects of sequester on that.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that the sequester has caused a problem beyond the overall squeeze that sequester has placed on defense spending.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel seemed to be concerned about the sequester --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would certainly defer to Secretary Hagel who knows in greater detail about those challenges than I do.</p>\n<p>Let me go to Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a statement of administration policy I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify, if the Upton bill were presented to the President, would he veto it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a statement -- well, not again, but as you noted, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a statement of administration policy, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a formal response or statement for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I said yesterday and today is our view of that legislation or legislation like it that would, in attempting to address the problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing with those who have had their policies canceled and are not necessarily part of the group who will be able to get free quality health insurance through Medicaid or better, higher-quality insurance at the same or lower cost because of the tax credits, that that -- in trying to fix that problem, this would introduce a whole other series of problems that potentially could undermine the central promise and premise of the Affordable Care Act and the minimum standards that it sets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President would want to veto?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Major, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a statement of administration policy.\xc2\xa0 The language we use goes to -- there are formalities involved in that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we do not support the legislation as it\xe2\x80\x99s been described or introduced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To use your phrase, the Upton bill or a piece of legislation like that -- does the Landrieu bill fall into that category of legislation like the Upton bill, therefore having the same defects?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that Senator Landrieu\xe2\x80\x99s proposal shares a similar goal to what the President has asked his team to explore.\xc2\xa0 There may be ways to help some people with cancellation notices without legislation, but we are happy to work with her and any member of Congress who has ideas on how to make the Affordable Care Act better.\xc2\xa0 So I think there is a distinction.\xc2\xa0 And again, even with -- well, I think if you look at the language surrounding both bills, there are substantive distinctions.\xc2\xa0 The overall point I would make is that any lawmaker here, any member here, of either party, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re -- and the President has said this all along -- if there are Republicans who are sincerely interested in making improvements and fixing problems to the Affordable Care Act so that it delivers the benefits that the American people have coming to them by law, then the President is very interested in working with those members.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen thus far from Republicans, and I think we heard from the Speaker today, is that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually not -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to label all of them -- but I think the position that they have held for so many years now has not changed, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, which is that their preference, their goal in all of this is to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and to return us to the status quo ante, which is one in which insurance companies can cancel your policy, and one in which, by the way -- this is an interesting statistic when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the individual insurance market -- where on an annual basis, prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, premiums rose 15 percent on average every year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, this is a part of the market where consumers are most susceptible to price hikes and premium hikes and changes in their policies, and have so few choices that they -- and especially so few affordable choices that they, in order to get some coverage, are often purchasing policies that provide substandard coverage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it can\xe2\x80\x99t be lost amidst all the justifiable focus on the problems with the implementation here that the Affordable Care Act was designed to fix a real problem, and a problem for the American people, a problem for employers, and a problem when it comes to overall costs for the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the Affordable Care Act continues to do what it has done thus far, which is reduce health care inflation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on Senate Democrats for a second, because Harry Reid has just announced he will bring the entire Democratic caucus here to the White House tomorrow to meet with the President to talk about the health care law.\xc2\xa0 A, can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 B, will this be the place where the President and his senior advisors will at least begin to brief Senate Democrats on a possible fix to this particular individual insurance market problem that he sees and wants resolved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that any meeting we have with Senate Democrats would be one of a series of meetings that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having on this and many other issues.\xc2\xa0 So it would not be -- when it comes to addressing the cancellation issues, it would not be the first conversation or meeting we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with Senate Democratic leadership or rank-and-file members.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on confirming the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in terms of engaging lawmakers who are focused on getting this right and are rightfully frustrated and concerned that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been implemented well thus far.\xc2\xa0 So we want to work with them and will continue to do that in an effort to make sure that the American people get the benefits that they deserve through the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned polls earlier, and I --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I was the first to mention it.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, which is unusual, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the hook.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The Quinnipiac poll said a lot of things, but one thing -- the only one thing I want to ask you about is that 52 percent in that poll -- and this is consistent with some other survey data -- say they do not believe the President is honest and trustworthy; 44 percent said they do believe he\xe2\x80\x99s honest and trustworthy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For the first time, a majority, though a narrow majority, place the President and his word in the not-trustworthy/not-honest category.\xc2\xa0 How damaging is that for the President?\xc2\xa0 And I want you to sort of remember your previous life as a reporter who looked at presidents -- that can often be a tipping point for any president, where they\xe2\x80\x99re not believed or their message is not as credible as it once was.\xc2\xa0 Is that now a problem for this White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course, when I was a reporter I never reacted impetuously to any individual poll.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, it\xe2\x80\x99s not only one poll.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that there is no question that the dysfunction in Washington that the American people have seen is taking its toll on everyone.\xc2\xa0 And while the President\xe2\x80\x99s ratings are low for him, they\xe2\x80\x99re sky high in comparison with Congress and in particular Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that is an --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He can\xe2\x80\x99t be comfortable with these numbers.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was just going to say, that\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfactory to us, only because it reflects a feeling among the American people that this place is not working for them.\xc2\xa0 And that was reflected very clearly in the wholly unnecessary shutdown, which damaged the economy, hurt the middle class without reason, and it\xe2\x80\x99s reflected I think in some of the frustration that the American people have felt or have felt in response to reports that others have felt about the website and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>We need to focus here on getting the work done that the American people sent us to do, and that means working together to fix problems when they arise, not to try to score political points, and it means taking ownership and responsibility for problems that happen on your watch.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President do that.\xc2\xa0 You saw him do it right away with the website, and you saw him do it when talking about those in the individual market who have been left in a bad situation because of these cancellations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he can do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What he can do is show -- and I think this would apply to any elected official here -- that what they can do against the backdrop of this dissatisfaction and unhappiness with Washington is prove to their constituents that they\'re waking up every day working for them.\xc2\xa0 And that means spending less time fighting about ideological differences and more time focused on fixes and solutions to the problems that the American people feel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, I think we all know, if we look at this data, that most Americans aren\'t focused on healthcare.gov, they\'re focused on their economic plight and whether or not they\'re going to have a pay raise and whether their families\' economic situation is going to get better; whether or not they\'re going to be able to send their kids to school; if they have young kids, do they have quality preschool for them.</p>\n<p>So those are the issues that we need to keep in mind -- all of us.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I promise not to belabor this, but this is a singular attitude about the President and his believability and his words.\xc2\xa0 Dysfunction can be registered in polling data across the spectrum, and it\'s certainly not a new phenomenon in Washington, okay?\xc2\xa0 This seems to represent a new low for the President, and I\'m wondering if you think it\'s a reflection of the public\'s digestion of what the President said about insurance policies -- you can keep them -- that having to be revised, and that he\'s in an undertow of some of the rhetoric that did not meet the public\'s expectation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t contest any analysis that\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable that you might apply to this, which, whatever it is, I think the lesson that we have to draw from it is that the American people are not satisfied; that we\'re, all of us, focused on the things that matter to them, and we\'re not getting the results that they want.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, that means that -- that includes the President and Congress getting the results that they believe they ought to see, and that means getting the website working and taking care of those people who are adversely affected by the transition in the individual market.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\'s focused on.</p>\n<p>And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time worrying about ups and downs in the polls, not because he\'s different from the rest of Washington or people who are in elected office -- because he knows that he wasn\'t sent here to have this rating in answer to this question in a poll.\xc2\xa0 He was sent here to deliver on what he ran on.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s very instructive -- if you go back to 2007 and look at what he said about health care reform in Iowa, he said that people have been fighting over the need to reform the health care system for years, and they have not succeeded.\xc2\xa0 And they have not succeeded because the entrenched interests and the establishment have forced failure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what he was able to achieve with Congress was passage of comprehensive health care reform.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s half of the deal; the other half is implementing that comprehensive health care reform, the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said he would do.</p>\n<p>And doing what you said you would do is the way that you demonstrate to the American people, to your constituents, that you\'re focused on them.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning, senior White House aides got a briefing from the President\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence review panel on their preliminary conclusions.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House plan to do anything with that, or are you going to wait until the December 15th final report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s accurate what you say about the interim report, but there is no public presentation of a preliminary or interim report.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about that at the conclusion of the review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without getting into the details of the report, can you say whether the White House plans to act based on this briefing today or whether the White House plans to wait until December to take actions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I have said in the past -- and this is not specific to this report or anything that might be contained within it -- that as part of the overall review of our intelligence-gathering practices, decisions are being made by the President and implemented by the President, but beyond that, I have to ask you to wait until the reviews, the various reviews have been completed and we have more to say, that we can say in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s as transparent as possible, mindful of the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with sensitive, often classified information.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quick, just on the Landrieu bill, because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fully clear to me -- one of the architects, MIT professor Jonathan Gruber says it\xe2\x80\x99s -- basically says the Landrieu bill, while not as bad as the Upton bill in undermining the law, also would undermine some large portions of the law.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration share that view?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a specific review.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that Senator Landrieu\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, as I understand it, shares the goal that the President discussed with you and that he has asked his team to achieve through proposals that they will present to him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific on the Landrieu proposal except to say that we do believe that she and other lawmakers are sincere in their efforts to try to fix identifiable problems and gaps and holes in the legislation -- in this case specifically the problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing with regard to those who have received notices in the individual market.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with her and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with others.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re open to, as I said, both legislative and administrative solutions --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well you guys ruled out legislative solutions last week.\xc2\xa0 This feels like no longer --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ruled out --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not fully ruled out, but on this it seemed to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say now this is going to be a legislative solution.\xc2\xa0 The Landrieu bill is probably the vehicle here at this point.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I tried to convey with my \xe2\x80\x9csooner rather than later\xe2\x80\x9d language that the President\xe2\x80\x99s team has or will be presenting him with options to address this problem and that we will be having something to say about that in the near future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That does not preclude other avenues that we would consider supporting and examine that are meant to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily an either/or.\xc2\xa0 If we can achieve this administratively, we will certainly look at that possibility.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to do this either administratively and legislatively -- or legislatively, we\'ll look at that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that our approach has always been to work with anyone who is sincerely focused on fixing problems to make it better, as opposed to introducing legislation that\'s designed to actually kill reform and send the American people back to the world of health care insurance that existed before the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, are you concerned that the low enrollment numbers -- you said no matter what they are, you\'re not going to be satisfied -- will end up -- become sort of snowball, if you will, where it becomes where people then avoid the website, avoid signing up; that it becomes an inevitable issue that people just don\'t want to sign up for the health care, they don\'t trust it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that has to be a concern that the problems we\'ve seen with the website have caused those Americans who actually have self-identified as being part of the universe of people who want to get insurance through the marketplaces some concern about whether it will work, even if we say it\'s working.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re going to have to work overtime to provide information to those Americans about how the website is working, what their options are through the various avenues available to us to get them that information and allow them to sign up and enroll -- working with insurance companies, with the states, and obviously with the team that\'s fixing the website.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no question we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our work harder for us, no question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the law have a credibility problem?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like the law is a credibility problem?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this goes to what I\'ve been referring to, which is that the law delivers benefits that any survey, when you itemize those benefits, reflects overwhelming support for.\xc2\xa0 It is our responsibility to make sure that the law is implemented so that those benefits are delivered to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the politics, good or bad, will flow from that.\xc2\xa0 With all the problems, with the implementation that we\'ve seen with the marketplaces, it is absolutely important to remember, because this is not -- the Affordable Care Act is not running against itself in the campaign of public opinion, it\'s also running against the alternative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as you know, opponents of the Affordable Care Act have offered this as an alternative -- they\'ve said this, you\'re on your own, you\'re out of luck; we don\'t want to reform the health care system.\xc2\xa0 You\'re seeing lawmakers who have shown no interest in reforming the system in a way that provides accessible, affordable health insurance to those who haven\'t had it in the past profess great concern about people getting thrown off their insurance policies.\xc2\xa0 And these are lawmakers who have never, in the history of their time in the Congress, submitted legislation that would deal with that problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\'s some crocodile tears out there, and there are people rooting for failure.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s always been the case.\xc2\xa0 Our responsibility is to focus on those people who need these benefits, and if we keep our focus on that and on those people, we\'ll end up okay.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To just quickly follow up on Major\'s question --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just going to keep taking questions until I have one person left, and then, Goyal, I will call on you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Major\'s questions about honesty and credibility and what the American people think -- I\'ve had a steady stream of emails for the last several days from just regular readers analyzing the President\'s interview with Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Do you all consider what he did with Chuck to be an apology?\xc2\xa0 And if so --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he said, I\'m sorry, and I regret -- yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if so, what was he apologizing for in your mind?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was apologizing for the fact that the law in its implementation left people in a place who are in this -- the portion of people in the individual market who believed that they could keep their insurance if they wanted it but are now faced with a situation where, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance three years ago, this specific policy, so it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be grandfathered in, they may not -- the universe of people he\'s particularly concerned about are those who do not in the current environment necessarily get Medicaid or quality, affordable insurance that\xe2\x80\x99s better for the same or lower price.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in your mind, he was not apologizing for misleading people.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President said, the statement that has been often repeated, reflects what he absolutely believed and wanted the Affordable Care Act to deliver.\xc2\xa0 And it is our responsibility to make sure that, to the extent that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, we can make those fixes so that people who are adversely affected --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even if you believed it, it could be the case that he misled them even though he thought it was true but then ended up misleading.\xc2\xa0 Is it an apology?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Now, think about the logic of what you\'re saying.\xc2\xa0 What is absolutely the case is that 85 -- or 80 percent of the American people get their insurance, like most of us here, through our employers.\xc2\xa0 The standing up of the marketplaces has no impact on that except that we all get benefits because of the Affordable Care Act that we did not have before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So another 15 percent get -- or rather 15 percent -- so the 80 percent is employers plus Medicare and Medicaid, 15 percent are uninsured, and 5 percent are in the individual market.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the universe we\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely true that for those people in that 80 percent, they are in their employer plans, they\'re in Medicare, they\'re in Medicaid, they\'re through the VA, they don\xe2\x80\x99t -- they keep what they have if they like it.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly true that people who have individual plans that as stipulated by the law were grandfathered in even though they don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the minimum standards, get to keep it if they like it.</p>\n<p>It\'s true, too, that, depending on the state and the insurance company, that even plans that were purchased last year or the year before that are substandard and don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the standards, could be renewed through early renewal for a year if so desired.\xc2\xa0 But there is still a universe of people who the President is concerned about, and he made that I think abundantly clear in his interview.</p>\n<p>Again, this is about -- it\'s not about like winning or losing the week or the day; it\xe2\x80\x99s about delivering on -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s about delivering on the promise of the law.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants his team to focus on that, and he is confident that as we tackle these problems and we get it right, and we work with lawmakers who want to get it right, that we will end up where we need to be when it comes to Americans getting the affordable quality health insurance that they deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about delivering on the promise that the President made.\xc2\xa0 You seem confident the website\xe2\x80\x99s difficulties are going to be corrected by the end of the month, largely.\xc2\xa0 Will the President also be able to deliver on his promise that if you like your health insurance, you can keep it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing, the President addressed this in an interview last week.\xc2\xa0 He has tasked his team to come up with solutions to deal with -- to help those individuals that we talked about.\xc2\xa0 And you can expect more information from us on that sooner rather than later.\xc2\xa0 We are also consulting with and working with lawmakers about their ideas for how to address that problem legislatively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking how now, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for a commitment.\xc2\xa0 Will the President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made a commitment to get solutions to this problem that he talked about in the interview with NBC.\xc2\xa0 And when we have those solutions, you can judge -- and I expect fair and balanced treatment in that judgment -- you can judge whether they\xe2\x80\x99re effective.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On fair and balanced, if I can -- Majority Leader Cantor says the President told him privately at Blair House in 2010 there were people who would lose their insurance policies under Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 Did that not happen?\xc2\xa0 And if it did happen, how could he make the promise that he made?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again -- well, not again -- I will stipulate what you might expect that I was not present for a conversation -- what sounds like a private conversation between Eric Cantor and the President.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that, like the rest of the House Republican leadership, Congressman Cantor has worked overtime to ensure through every power he has available to him that the health care market and the health insurance system in this country is not reformed; worked overtime to put bills on the floor in the House that Republicans can vote for futilely to repeal or sabotage or eliminate the Affordable Care Act and replace it with exactly nothing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And his answer has always been legislatively, tough luck -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re somebody whose rates go up every year, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman who pays double because there is no regulation preventing insurance companies for paying double for the same policy that a man gets, tough luck -- because there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any indication of a willingness by Congressman Cantor or others in the House Republican leadership to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 There used to be a willingness among Republicans to try to tackle this problem.\xc2\xa0 The past Presidents, Republican Presidents have engaged in an effort to reform the health care system.</p>\n<p>The bill the President worked with Congress to produce is based on a model out of Massachusetts that was signed into law and was known as Romneycare -- a Republican governor.\xc2\xa0 There was a bill during the early 1990s, when President Clinton was in office, trying to reform the health care system that was sponsored by Republican senators, moderates, that is an antecedent to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>The whole point of the path the President took through the Affordable Care Act was to cause -- to build on the existing private insurance system, because doing it that way caused the least amount of disruption.\xc2\xa0 Engaging in the sort of kinds of proposals that some Republicans have put forward to end Medicare as we know it or turn that system into a voucher program have been much more radical, much more than anything the President proposed or signed into law.\xc2\xa0 And bills on the left that focus on single payer obviously would be -- if that had been achieved, would have been much more disruptive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The point of the Affordable Care Act was to build on the existing system, to build on the private insurance market, expand it, make it more competitive, add more customers to it.\xc2\xa0 And through that competition, create some downward pressure on health care costs.</p>\n<p>And I think that, again, against everything that Eric Cantor and others said would be true, we\'ve seen the slowest rate of health care inflation over the last three years that we\'ve seen in 50 years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, BBC reported that some of the American planes that flew into the Philippines originally were empty.\xc2\xa0 They were just there to pick up American citizens.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that a bit arrogant?\xc2\xa0 Why would we --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Connie, I\'m not aware of that report.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you, as I just cited, that we are providing an extraordinary amount of aid.\xc2\xa0 The President is very focused on what we can do and the help we can provide, as he conveyed to President Aquino yesterday, to the Filipino people who are suffering mightily in the wake of this terrible, terrible typhoon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, on faith leaders, what did the President want from the faith groups on immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President heard in that meeting was a commitment to comprehensive immigration reform from faith leaders that reflects his commitment, and was an important reminder to all of us that there is an amazing consensus out there behind the need for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t often see a big idea like this that has the support of business and labor, law enforcement and faith leaders, evangelicals, the Catholic church, Republicans and Democrats.</p>\n<p>I think that by all the standards that we measure these things in Washington, that represents a remarkable level of consensus.\xc2\xa0 And we ought to seize that, get it done for the economy.\xc2\xa0 You want to grow the economy, create more jobs, make the middle class more secure, enhance our border security, ensure that the best and the brightest from abroad who come to our universities, the best universities in the world, to study stay here and create new businesses here and hire people here?\xc2\xa0 Pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Do it for your constituents.\xc2\xa0 Do it, because it\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Roger, last question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Iran, Kerry and Biden are both on the Hill today, urging lawmakers to hold off on any further sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What are the arguments they\'re making?\xc2\xa0 And what would be the consequence if lawmakers do not hold off?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re correct that Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman and Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen are briefing the Senate Democratic leadership today to provide them with an update on the P5-plus-1 negotiations, as well as our consultations with allies.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry, Under Secretary Sherman and Under Secretary Cohen are also briefing the Senate Banking Committee today.</p>\n<p>On the question of the pause that we believe is necessary in sanctions activity, I would simply say that this is not a question or debate about being for or against sanctions.\xc2\xa0 This President has led an effort that has resulted in the most punishing set of comprehensive sanctions ever put together in history, and those sanctions and the isolation that, again, the United States has led in creating have forced Iran to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The price for their intransigence has been very high for the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 And thus, the new leadership in Iran as well as the Supreme Leader have indicated a willingness to engage in serious negotiations around the central obligation that Iran has to meet its international obligations for the first time in a very long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it is the responsibility of this President, on behalf of the American people, to see whether or not this can be resolved diplomatically, because the alternative, if our stated goal is what it is, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, is military action.\xc2\xa0 The President won\xe2\x80\x99t take that off the table.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s very serious about the fact that it remains on the table.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s very serious about the fact that the window of opportunity to pursue a diplomatic solution is open but will not stay open forever.</p>\n<p>But it should be clear to members of Congress who do not believe we ought to pursue the potential for a peaceful resolution here that there\xe2\x80\x99s a binary choice.\xc2\xa0 If not at least testing the hypothesis that Iran is serious about resolving this diplomatically, then what option do we have left?\xc2\xa0 And those who take that position ought to be clear that they, in essence, are suggesting that war is the only alternative.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that if further sanctions were added, that the November 20 next rounds of negotiations would get blown up, would not take place?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the specific impact I think is hard to predict, but I think that the point is that we ought to have a pause so that these negotiations can take place and we can test whether or not there is a willingness by Iran to verifiably and transparently take steps to halt progress in its nuclear program, to roll back some of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and then to engage in a process for a final resolution of these concerns in a verifiable, transparent and concrete way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And our view that we are clearly and strongly asserting to Congress is that we have had great partners in Congress on this effort and that Congress ought to hold in abeyance the possibility of passing new sanctions for the time when they might be necessary, because -- to help effect a result.\xc2\xa0 And our view -- Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s view, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- is that that time is not now.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:01 P.M.
