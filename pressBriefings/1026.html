EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for being here as we make our way to New Hampshire, where the President will, as you know, give a speech making a strong case for Congress to pass the provision within the American Jobs Act that would extend and expand the payroll tax cut that every working American has gotten this year, and which every working American will not get unless Congress acts.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress does not act, 160 million Americans will, on average, see their taxes go up by $1,000 next year, which would be a terrible thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as you know, in the American Jobs Act, called for an expansion of that tax cut, so if the Congress, in its infinite wisdom, were to act on the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, which will be moved in the Senate, and passed, that it would mean a $1,500 tax cut for the average American family next year, as well as a tax cut for businesses that hire new employees or expand their payroll.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any calls that the President has made since last night?\xc2\xa0 Did he call Senator Murray or Congressman Hensarling?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have any calls to any members of the super committee since that outbound trip in San Diego?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I answered this about seven different times yesterday; I can do that here again if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a plan mid-September, a highly detailed and comprehensive plan, laying out exactly what he believed the super committee should do in order to achieve the kind of deficit reduction mandated by Congress itself.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he laid out a plan that would achieve deficit reduction far in excess of that mandate, therefore providing the super committee a variety of options by which to get to a mere $1.2 trillion, because the options put on the -- within the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan were $3 trillion in size.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, throughout this process, the President had a responsibility as a leader in this process, that was a congressional process, to do three things:\xc2\xa0 one, make clear to the American public, make clear to the super committee and make clear to all of Congress what his plan was, what his vision was; he did that, as I just described.\xc2\xa0 Two, rally public support behind his vision; he tried to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I think every one of your organizations, I believe, has had public polling that clearly demonstrates that the public overwhelmingly supported the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach -- overwhelmingly.\xc2\xa0 Not just Democrats, not just independents, but Republicans as well.\xc2\xa0 Three, lead his party to accept the kind of tough choices that the President was asking Democrats to make in the name of achieving a balanced approach for deficit and debt reduction and long-term debt control.\xc2\xa0 He did that as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody who reported on this and knows what the Democrats were offering in the super committee knows that there were very tough choices that Democrats were willing to make on entitlement reform and other issues -- spending cuts -- if only the Republicans were willing to budge at all on the fundamental obstacle here, the fundamental reason that the super committee failed, was because Republicans refused to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mine is a logistical question, though.\xc2\xa0 Since the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I answered it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay -- no calls since last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I answered that now three times, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved on to sort of this new phase in the debate where the President is going to focus on the payroll tax cut extension and the jobless benefits and renewing those, what is the strategy going to be?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to be see him mostly focusing again on trying to rally public support for those proposals, or are we going to see him more involved with lawmakers in coming up with a legislative strategy to get them to pass by the end of the year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of business to be done between now and the end of the year before Congress goes on its month-long recess.\xc2\xa0 And that includes a number of appropriations bills, as well as getting as much of the American Jobs Act passed as humanly possible, or congressionally possible, if you will.\xc2\xa0 So the President will be engaged at every level in that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, every provision within the jobs act is the kind of provision that has been supported by Republicans as well as Democrats in the past.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all provisions that have been broadly supported by the public.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re all paid for in a way -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan and in the way that Senate Democrats have put his ideas forward in ways that have been supported by broad majorities of the American public.\xc2\xa0 He certainly hopes that Congress will go along with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is inconceivable to me and to him that a Republican Congress would want to raise taxes on 160 million hardworking Americans next year, all in the name of protecting tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Foreign policy, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a view on whether Saif al-Islam Qaddafi should be tried in The Hague or by Libyans in Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We urge the TNC and the Libyan authorities to continue their cooperation with the ICC, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important process.\xc2\xa0 And they have been cooperating, so we think that\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Mitt Romney is unveiling his first television ads in New Hampshire today, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all aimed at Obama.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be taking on Mitt on this trip today, or is the focus the payroll tax?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Focus on the urgent need to grow the economy and create jobs, and, specifically today, to ensure that Americans have extra money in their pockets next year to help them pay their bills and make ends meet, and also to grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 He will not be talking about the many different candidates for the Republican nomination today.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can say, about that ad -- I think the campaign has made comment.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what -- seriously?\xc2\xa0 I mean, an ad in which they deliberately distort what the President said?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a rather remarkable way to start, and an unfortunate way to start.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to see numerous news organizations point out the blatant dishonesty in the ad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President worried about a downgrade in S&amp;P and another downgrade?\xc2\xa0 What can the President do to help avoid this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make predictions about what ratings agencies will do.\xc2\xa0 I think some have already made some comments about this, but for anything more specific I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one more thing on the deficit committee.\xc2\xa0 Given that the cuts that they have to enact don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take place until 2013, is there concern that lawmakers might try to push this off until after the 2012 election, wait to see what voters do in that election, and then basically we\xe2\x80\x99re set up for a fight in the lame duck next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That would be unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 That would be far less than ideal, and it would be a shame because there is plenty of time now.\xc2\xa0 The super committee may have failed but Congress has certainly the capacity here to get something done to avoid the deliberately onerous imposition of the sequester.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo one would hope that, in the coming months, that Congress would do its job and make some I think fairly basic and simple choices about how to achieve deficit reduction in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoing back to this question, and it clearly is on my mind because there\xe2\x80\x99s -- a lot of the reporting has been good, I feel, about what went down and why the super committee failed.\xc2\xa0 But there is a certain amount of analysis that -- where commentators on this find refuge in the comfort of declaring a pox on both their houses, a false moral equivalence of \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody is guilty, everybody is to blame.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear here:\xc2\xa0 You all reported on it.\xc2\xa0 You know how difficult it was for Democrats to go along with the kind of entitlement reforms the President was willing to support if the Republicans were willing to do something in a balanced way, were willing to deal with revenue.\xc2\xa0 You see what the Democrats put on the table, the super committee, and it has, as Senator\xc2\xa0Corbin** himself said, \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated a willingness by Democrats to put entitlement reform on the table.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we never saw, and have yet to see, is a willingness -- a commensurate willingness -- by Republicans to do what the public says should be done, which is ask the wealthiest Americans who have done exceptionally well -- far better than the rest of the country over the past 10 years, even 30 years -- to pay a little bit extra so that we can get our fiscal house in order, and not do it on the backs of the middle class and senior citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why the Republican Party is so hamstrung -- because the very men and woman who would occupy the Oval Office stood up on a stage and all raised their hand and said they would not accept a deal that had as its foundation $10 in spending cuts every $1 in revenue.\xc2\xa0 That is so wildly inconsistent with where the public is, so wildly out of the mainstream, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise, then, if those are the Republican standard bearers, that Republicans in Congress are not willing to do what is obvious to all, what the public supports.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Helene\xe2\x80\x99s question on the decision to go to New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 The President might not be talking about the specific Republican candidates, but his selection of Manchester, in New Hampshire, is a fairly loud political statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to another town in New Hampshire?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a huge state.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think all of New Hampshire is well known as a famous state politically --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The selection of New Hampshire --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- well, wait, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a primary.\xc2\xa0 I will -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll confidently predict that he\xe2\x80\x99ll win the primary in the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of states that matter in the political process in this country, and if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t travel to any of them, you would severely limit your ability to travel around the country.\xc2\xa0 The President has gone north, south, east and west, and will continue to travel around the country making the case for his agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have -- just shifting to international affairs -- do you have anything on Egypt?\xc2\xa0 Fourth day of protests in Tahrir Square.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are deeply concerned about the violence.\xc2\xa0 The violence is deplorable.\xc2\xa0 We call on restraint -- we call on all sides to exercise restraint.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the elections go forward.\xc2\xa0 And, again, going back to the first point, the violence needs to stop.\xc2\xa0 The Egyptians need to be able to decide their future and decide it in a peaceful manner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any anything on the prime minister-elect in Spain?\xc2\xa0 Has the President called, reached out to him yet?\xc2\xa0 Anything in Europe in general?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new on Europe, beyond what I said yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, there\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing I wanted to say.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 One other thing I wanted to say.\xc2\xa0 No, let\xe2\x80\x99s just talk about the calls for undoing the sequester, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us the White House views on undoing the sequester?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I just am curious --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hans, I am so glad you asked, because let\xe2\x80\x99s go -- let\xe2\x80\x99s examine this within the context of approval ratings for</p>\n<p>\n\tCongress that hover in single digits, maybe 10 or 11 percent, and ask ourselves why that might be the case when you have members of Congress who voted for the sequester, said we will hold ourselves accountable.\xc2\xa0 This is a sword of Damocles over our heads to make sure that we, Congress, will act responsibly.\xc2\xa0 Never mind, they say, we won\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, why do you think people are so cynical about how Congress works?\xc2\xa0 If they pass a law that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to hold them responsible for their actions and then say, never mind, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be held responsible for our actions -- there is an obvious -- look, those cuts in the sequester are broad and onerous for a reason, because they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to force action by Congress to avoid them.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re never supposed to take place.\xc2\xa0 And they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take place, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t take place if Congress simply acts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the concern about national defense is understandable, and I think that one way to -- if the concern is so great about the need to maintain a certain level of defense spending, there is an easy way out here, which is be willing to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more in order to achieve this comprehensive and balanced deficit reduction plan, and then the sequester will never kick in.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No wiggle room on the veto threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No wiggle room.\xc2\xa0 No wiggle room.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even in a potential lame duck session?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke very clearly on this.\xc2\xa0 Let me think, is there anything else I have to say?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) Any other questions I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alister Bull of Reuters usually has a variety of good questions in his notebook.\xc2\xa0 Alister?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All done.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, guys, thanks you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:54 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
