EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us for this trip deep into the heart of Texas this morning.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve done the past couple of weeks, I will be on hand to answer a couple of questions you may have about official administration policy, and my colleague, Jen, is here to talk to you about the President\'s reelection campaign and reelection activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we get started, there is one piece of official business that I did want to raise for you.\xc2\xa0 Later this morning, the Office of Personnel Management will be releasing some specifics per a directive from the President last week about providing health insurance to the seasonal workers at the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture who are fighting -- firefighters out West.\xc2\xa0 This is something the President directed OPM to do in conjunction with the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture.\xc2\xa0 So you should look for an announcement -- that should be out by the time we land in Texas in a couple of hours.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to start with two announcements.\xc2\xa0 One is, as you may have seen overnight, we have a new ad in Pennsylvania that will be welcoming Mitt Romney to the state today, called, "Makes You Wonder."\xc2\xa0 It highlights the question of whether Mitt Romney paid his fair share in taxes.\xc2\xa0 As we know, until he releases more years of tax returns we\'re not going to have additional information on why he had investments in the Cayman Islands, why he had investments in a company in Bermuda, and what decisions he was involved in.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second announcement, I just wanted to highlight -- actually I just wanted to run through the schedule through the day just so everybody is clear on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are four fundraisers today, two in San Antonio, two in Austin.\xc2\xa0 So we start off the day with an event at the Henry Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio.\xc2\xa0 We expect about 1,200 people.\xc2\xa0 The tickets started at $250.\xc2\xa0 That will be followed by a private reception at a private home.\xc2\xa0 We expect about 70 people. Those tickets were $35,800 per person.\xc2\xa0 Then we\'ll go to Austin later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll have an event at the Austin Music Hall.\xc2\xa0 We expect about 1,100 people.\xc2\xa0 Tickets start at $250.\xc2\xa0 Then we\'ll have a private reception there where we expect about 80 people, and the tickets are $25,000 per couple.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, we\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you attacking the President on his income -- I mean Governor Romney on his income taxes?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that we\'re going to see more of this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, Amie, when you hear the President speak today at several of those events, what you\'ll hear him do is lay out the choice the American people are facing, the differing visions he has from Mitt Romney for the future of the country, and his commitment to continue to fight for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have raised, as many people have raised, including many Republicans -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been a growing number over the last couple of days -- Bill Kristol, Haley Barbour over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 We saw the governor of Alabama just ask for Mitt Romney to release further years of tax returns, and this is a call that\'s not just being made by us, it\xe2\x80\x99s being made by many people including people from Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s own party.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the President -- will he address that today at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks will focus on what he wants to do to lead the country over the next four years, and his differing vision from Mitt Romney.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, is it fair to suggest, however, as the ad does and as if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing, that Romney may not have, in fact, paid any taxes, or may have hidden some, when we, in fact, don\'t know what those tax returns might show?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, the ad raises the question that we won\xe2\x80\x99t know, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible for anyone to know, until he releases further years of tax returns and everybody is able to examine what is included in them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Cheney is on the Hill today to talk to Republicans on how to avoid sequestration.\xc2\xa0 Has he been in contact with the President at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any phone calls to read out to you between the President and the former Vice President.\xc2\xa0 It does seem odd to me, however, that House Republicans would be taking budget advice from somebody who famously declared that "deficits don\'t matter."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President obviously has a different view, which is that deficits do matter, which is why the President has laid out a balanced approach to dealing with our long-term deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll finally get Republicans to agree to work with him on that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons that the Republicans have continuously rebuffed the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to reach this long-term solution is because they feel it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the wealthy to do their fair share, deal with our deficit challenges in conjunction with making some pretty significant cuts in government spending, as well as dealing with some of the challenges -- budgetary challenges posed by our entitlement programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President believes that this comprehensive balanced approach is what\xe2\x80\x99s required, and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready and waiting for Republicans to get onboard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support Democrats who are threatening with the fiscal cliff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, the President believes firmly that there is a way for us to deal with our deficit challenges that doesn\'t involve the historic funding cuts that are included in the sequester.\xc2\xa0 There is bipartisan agreement about the fact that the cuts that are included in the so-called sequester would not be good for our economy, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve even heard the Secretary of Defense raising concerns about the impact that it could have on national security.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans -- a majority of Republicans -- voted for the sequester in an effort to force Congress to act to reach a long-term solution to our deficit challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has put forward an approach that mirrors the approach that has been taken by a wide range of bipartisan commissions that have looked at this problem, and the only thing that is standing in the way are congressional Republicans who are fighting tooth and nail to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s just middle-class families that should have to sacrifice to deal with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all in this together, and that includes asking those wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, millionaires and billionaires, essentially, to do their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Syrian ambassador who defected has raised the possibility that the Syrian government will use chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any intel to back that up?\xc2\xa0 And is that a concern that the White House is looking at?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Syrian ambassador to Iraq, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any comment at this point about intelligence reports about Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is -- this is something that the State Department has also expressed publicly -- is that there are certain responsibilities that go along with the handling and storage and security of those chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the individuals who are responsible for living up to those challenges should do so and will be held accountable for doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of the specific intelligence reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to comment on those one way or the other.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. concerned that Assad may use those chemical weapons against his own people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have seen is inhumane brutality from the Assad regime, and that is something that has aroused the concern -- against his own people I should say -- and that has certainly aroused concern not just by the President and U.S. officials, but by the leaders of countries all over the globe, including a number of countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Fed Chairman is testifying on the Hill today. Some Democrats want the Fed to consider using monetary policy to prime the economy given continued slowdown.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, as you know the Federal Reserve is completely independent.\xc2\xa0 And so I wouldn\'t want to comment on any decisions, any policy decisions they may be contemplating right now.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, the Chairman is going to testify before Congress later today, and I\'m sure that he\'ll have some thoughts on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President believes is that there are -- while it\'s the Fed\'s decision to decide whether or not to take action, the President believes Congress should act.\xc2\xa0 And there are a whole range of policies the President has put forth that the Congress can act on right away -- whether it\'s tax cuts for small businesses that want to hire new workers, whether it\'s offering responsible homeowners the opportunity to refinance their homes at historically low interest rates, whether it\'s investing in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has talked extensively, both in official events and on the campaign trail, about his view that we should take half the money that we get from bringing our troops home from Afghanistan, use half of that to pay down the deficit and use the other half to do some nation-building at home by investing in our ports, in our airports, in our railways and our runways and our highways -- that we can not only create construction jobs in the short term that would address the weakness in the construction sector, but also lay a foundation for our long-term economic strength in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be closely following what Bernanke says?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will certainly be interested to hear what Chairman Bernanke has to say when he testifies before Congress today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, can you give us more context for this trip to Texas, in terms of how often the President has been to Texas for fundraisers for the past year or so -- do you have any count on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\'m happy to get you some numbers on that. I don\'t have it in front of me now.\xc2\xa0 There are many Democrats who support the President in Texas, and we will see many of them today.\xc2\xa0 He will have a similar message to what you\'ve heard over the past couple of trips, in terms of laying out the contrast between what he is fighting for, who he is fighting for, and his vision for the future of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as you know, and as I mentioned, we expect to see a couple of thousand people here who are supportive of the President, excited to see him, and looking forward to sending him back for four more years.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll get you some specifics --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the first time he has gone to San Antonio since he has been in office, do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I will check that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One thing I would add to that is anybody who\xc2\xa0 -- having worked on the President\'s campaign in a private capacity in 2008, I actually spent about four really fun weeks in Texas in February of 2008.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, there were a lot of very strong supporters of the President in Texas.\xc2\xa0 Anybody who covered that race is certainly aware of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- tough primary, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was a tough primary.\xc2\xa0 It was exciting.\xc2\xa0 We were actually talking about this last week about what an exciting time in the campaign that was.\xc2\xa0 I was the communications director for the Texas campaign down here that spring.\xc2\xa0 But there are certainly a lot of very strong supporters of the President who were strong supporters of him in 2008 as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Marissa Mayer -- she\xe2\x80\x99s a supporter of his -- did he reach out to her?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any phone calls that he may have made to her yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, one of the events today I believe is co-sponsored by the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s LGBT Council.\xc2\xa0 The other one features leading Hispanics in Texas.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have specific messages to both those audiences today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President will be talking about his differing vision for the country.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues he\xe2\x80\x99s been fighting for, including access to affordable health care, access to education to middle-class families that are important to many different groups.\xc2\xa0 He will be interacting with the audience and there will be some opportunities for them to ask him questions, so there could be issues that come up related to that.\xc2\xa0 But I expect you will hear a consistent message of his differing vision for the country from his opponent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he do a kind of a town hall-style thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You will be there for the remarks, which you will enjoy thoroughly, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain.\xc2\xa0 And the people who are attending will, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, enjoy the interaction back and forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was my nice way of saying it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a lighter note, Josh, did the President have a reaction to being on the Kiss Cam last night and being turned down at first by his wife?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will say that this incident was the subject of some high-level conversations on the helicopter en route to Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s Air Force Base this morning.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I can tell you, based on a very good source, that reports the President was rebuffed are false.\xc2\xa0 The President and First Lady enjoyed the basketball game yesterday.\xc2\xa0 During the first half, they were sitting in the stands, noticed that their images were on the large screen, smiled, did not recognize that their images were on the screen in conjunction with the Kiss Cam.\xc2\xa0 So it was not until halftime, when the President and First Lady saw their daughters and their daughters asked them why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss during the Kiss Cam segment.\xc2\xa0 They remarked that they did not recognize they were on the screen during the Kiss Cam segment, and so during act two of the Kiss Cam promotion, the President took advantage to steal a kiss from his wife.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were reports of people at the game, which I was not, and I think our sportswriter took a photo where it appeared on the Kiss Cam that the President was leaning in to try for a kiss.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that they were not aware at all that -- what was going on with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also said he -- at the half time interview that he\xe2\x80\x99d talked to the women\xe2\x80\x99s team.\xc2\xa0 What were the circumstances of that -- before the game, after the game?\xc2\xa0 What did he say to them?\xc2\xa0 And then did he talk to any of the men\xe2\x80\x99s players or team at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Before the men\xe2\x80\x99s game, he was able to go I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was into the locker room or one of the rooms in the Verizon Center where the President was able to greet the women\xe2\x80\x99s team.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive in time to see their game.\xc2\xa0 But he got a chance to visit with each of them, and he thanked them for the way in which they\xe2\x80\x99re representing our country, that -- the President obviously has a very high opinion of the women\'s team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think he noted in his interview with Mark Jones yesterday that he actually expected that the women\'s basketball team might be an even bigger favorite in the basketball competition in the Olympics than the men\'s team.\xc2\xa0 So I also heard that he may have gotten a jersey from the women\'s team as well. So he had an opportunity to visit with them before he attended the men\'s game.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he had a chance to visit with any of the members of the men\'s team yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnything else?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 One other thing let me just raise since you\'re all here.\xc2\xa0 One story that came out overnight I would encourage all of you to read is a story in the Boston Globe that touches on the changing language that Mitt Romney\'s team and his surrogates have used to describe Mitt Romney\'s tenure at Bain.\xc2\xa0 They\'re starting to refer to it as that he didn\'t manage the day-to-day, which raises some questions about what exactly he did do.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to provide that to anyone, but I just wanted to highlight it while we were all here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing about the President\'s schedule -- I mean, four days this week he is campaigning out of town.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering is that going to be sort of the norm from here on out, three or four days a week?\xc2\xa0 And does that leave time for governing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the schedule weeks out from now.\xc2\xa0 We are three and a half months from the election.\xc2\xa0 While he is campaigning, he is reading briefing books, he is doing calls, he is having meetings with his advisors.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something -- he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe will be campaigning later this week in Florida, as you touched on, for two days.\xc2\xa0 And I think he looks forward to and really enjoys getting out there and having those conversations with the American people about what they\'re focused on.\xc2\xa0 And, oftentimes, that does impact his governing -- when he hears from people on concerns they have about small businesses -- yesterday, he heard from somebody whose father needed to get a job and he talked about infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 We had a conversation this morning about the drought and what we can do more on the drought.\xc2\xa0 And those are all conversations he is having while he\'s out on the campaign trail, meeting with the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he does take them back and discuss with his advisors as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:16 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
