Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  2:13 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just quickly do the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 The President will spend the weekend in Washington and has no scheduled public events.<br/> <br/>  On Monday the President will meet with President Uribe of Colombia here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 He will attend an event at the White House recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments of LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 Invited guests include families, volunteers, activists, and community leaders.<br/> <br/>  Tuesday the President will hold an event here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Wednesday the President will attend meetings --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of event?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Unclear.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday the President will attend meetings at the White House and an event in the D.C. area.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cryptic.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Very good, right?\xc2\xa0 We\'re expanding the circle.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  On Thursday the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Later the President will travel to Camp David, where he will remain until Saturday.\xc2\xa0 On Saturday the President will return to the White House and host a 4th of July event here in the evening.\xc2\xa0 And as you all know, on Sunday night the President will depart for Moscow.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any statements from --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know when the press charter is leaving?\xc2\xa0 Because the last we heard was either the 4th or the 5th.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Saturday.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Late, late in the day.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yikes.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up on Iran, out of today\'s press avail.\xc2\xa0 The President said there was no doubt that any direct dialogue or diplomacy with Iran is going to be affected by the events of the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to see if you could add a bit to that, what he means by "no doubt"?\xc2\xa0 What has definitely changed at this point and what still remains to be seen?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, I think you heard the President say in his news conference earlier in the week that right now our focus is on what\'s going on there on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Obviously lots has to -- a lot of things are going to have to shake out and get figured out obviously as we watch that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been clear on that.\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve mentioned here, there are multilateral invitations.<br/> <br/>  And, look, a lot of this is -- the Iranians have been offered a pathway to meet their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 In many ways, their actions are up to them and I think that\'s what the President said today.\xc2\xa0 The G8 last night reiterated their multilateral invitation through a statement -- based on an ongoing invitation from early April.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand he\'s been consistent saying that events have to play out and the U.S. is watching and the world is watching.\xc2\xa0 But when he says today there\'s no doubt that any direct dialogue is going to be affected by what\'s happened, is it clear at this point, regardless of what happens in the coming days, that at least something has changed?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, I think we\'ve seen the images, we\'ve seen the violence, we\'ve seen the actions in a way that leads I think many to believe that Iran isn\'t going to choose the pathway that\'s been offered by this and other countries as part of the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s -- again, I think their actions are up to them.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also wanted to ask quickly on climate.\xc2\xa0 The House had a test vote this morning and the climate bill narrowly got through there.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House as confident today as you were yesterday that this bill will ultimately pass?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, the President obviously has been engaged in talking to members, as have staff members here.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President discuss the importance of this legislation when he did -- when he met with you all with Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work it hard in hopes that today will make a big step forward in getting climate change and energy independence legislation one step closer to his desk.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he still confident?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just sort of a variation on the Iran question.\xc2\xa0 When the President said there was no doubt, did that mean that, in effect, he\'s decided to delay his outreach for now?\xc2\xa0 Or is he just sort of stating the obvious that the talks -- that the outreach can\'t proceed until the situation is --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s more stating the obvious of -- and again, reiterating what he said earlier in the week, that obviously the Iranian regime is involved in what\'s going on inside of Iran right now.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think, as I stated earlier, there are multilateral invitations.\xc2\xa0 And again I want to reiterate most of all that there are decisions relating to what\'s going on currently in Iran and ways for them to meet their responsibilities as it relates to nuclear weapons or terrorism that are, in many ways, decisions that they have to make.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s up to them to accept the pathway to responsibility.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I also wanted to ask a question about the meeting with President Uribe.\xc2\xa0 Colombia is very interested in getting the free trade agreement approved that\'s been pending for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting any sort of concrete results to come out of this meeting that would advance that agreement?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t get ahead of what the President will talk about -- or what might come out of the meeting, I should say.\xc2\xa0 But I have no doubt that it will be something that President Obama and President Uribe discuss early next week.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Grassley has said that the administration is stonewalling on these trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair way to characterize it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t honestly know the basis for which he makes that statement.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Greenpeace announced yesterday that it opposes the energy legislation.\xc2\xa0 And I know that President Obama wanted -- or originally proposed a hundred percent auction, and it\'s now down to 15 percent.\xc2\xa0 Greenpeace says that the lobbyists have gotten to this bill and watered it down so much that it\'s better not to pass it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if President Obama feels that this is the best bill that can pass Congress, or if he stands by the content of this bill regardless of the political realities?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there\'s no doubt that the President believes this would be a historic step forward in energy and climate change legislation; that he disagrees with those on both sides of the political spectrum that criticize this legislation.<br/> <br/>  Jake, I won\'t -- I believe the President would very clearly say that would a process of a hundred percent auction that he proposed in the campaign be a more perfect way to do it?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 But I think the administration is not going to make the perfect the enemy of the really, really good.\xc2\xa0 In a way that moves this bill -- it moves this legislation forward and gets us one step closer to taking comprehensive action to deal with dangerous greenhouse gas emissions that we all know threaten and endanger our planet.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s why he\'s working hard right now to ensure that it\'s one step closer today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I will ask.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked a lot about his love of music.\xc2\xa0 He hosted Stevie Wonder here.\xc2\xa0 He has talked a great deal about what\'s on his iPod to Rolling Stone Magazine.\xc2\xa0 Well, what\'s his reaction to the death of Michael Jackson?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I talked to him about it this morning.\xc2\xa0 Look, he said to me that obviously, Michael Jackson was a spectacular performer, a music icon.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody remembers hearing his songs, watching him moonwalk on television during Motown\'s 25th anniversary.\xc2\xa0 But the President also said, look, he had -- aspects of his life were sad and tragic.\xc2\xa0 And his condolences went out to the Jackson family and to fans that mourned his loss.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not a written statement, then?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I just said it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you say he did send condolences to the family -- did he call the family personally?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was going to be my question, but you answered it --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re done, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You guys really didn\'t have a bunch of climate change questions either.\xc2\xa0 I noticed you guys were a bit shy when the President was standing up there earlier today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were shocked.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we have shouted?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he waiting --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I could have arranged it through a third party.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooooh!\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did think about shouting, but I already did that once this week.<br/> <br/>  The administration has consistently said that you have not wanted to meddle in the Iranian elections.\xc2\xa0 But in the President\'s remarks today, when speaking about the opposition leader Mousavi, he said "he has captured the spirit and imagination of the Iranian people."\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that an endorsement?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 You know, look --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a strong endorsement.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this was in a question about defending a statement that some of you all had been critical of, in terms of not endorsing him earlier.<br/> <br/>  Look, the President, as he said today, has taken great pains not to interject himself or the United States into this back-and-forth.\xc2\xa0 I think we all understand -- and we\'ve seen the actions of President Ahmadinejad in just the last few days, trying very desperately to interject somebody else into this equation while people continue to make their voices heard and condemn the violent actions of the government.<br/> <br/>  I think -- again, I\'ve said this a lot over the past few days, and almost two weeks, but that\'s what some in Iran want this administration and this country to do.\xc2\xa0 And the President has spoken out about the universal principles that are involved here, while not getting involved in a debate in Iran, among Iranians.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Carter was in Gaza recently and said that the people there are treated like animals.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen President Carter\'s statement on that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes clearly that comprehensive peace can bring security, stability, and opportunity to all people in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has spoken about ensuring that hope and opportunity for Palestinians if both sides will have the courage to come together and seek that long-term peace.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The President always speaks about the right of the Israelis to exist, but he doesn\'t speak about Palestinians, who 7 percent of their land is under occupation.\xc2\xa0 Do they have a right to exist?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, Helen.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look back at the --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Under occupation?\xc2\xa0 How many years --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, let me not parse the President\'s words.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look through the speech in Cairo, I think the President is pretty clear in his support for comprehensive peace, as I said, a two-state solution that will bring stability, security, and opportunity to everyone in that troubled region of the world.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, my only follow-up is that in his public remarks, he only speaks of Israel\'s rights.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- we\'ll pull that Cairo speech and we can have a conversation about different aspects of it.\xc2\xa0 I think if you take a look at that again you\'ll see that the President is --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about other times that he talked.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, does that time not count?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long does he go on that he never speaks of Palestinians?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you can go back and look at his comments, and he\'s been very clear on this.<br/> <br/>  Chip.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ever since the President toughened his language a few days ago, two things have happened -- maybe more than two, but at least two.\xc2\xa0 One is that the dissent has been all but crushed.\xc2\xa0 So is he powerless to affect the situation there?\xc2\xa0 And second, Ahmadinejad has attempted to use his words as exactly the kind of foil and political football that the President wanted to avoid.\xc2\xa0 So, number one, is the President powerless there; and number two, did he give them the kind of ammunition that he was trying to avoid giving?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Interesting 180 on your earlier question from earlier in the week.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Times change.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, apparently.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the international community continues to condemn what is going on in Iran.\xc2\xa0 I think if you asked the Iranian regime where they are right now and where they sit and whether they think they\'re in good stead and in control of that country, I think you\'ll in a moment of honesty get a far different answer.\xc2\xa0 The President, again, has responded forcefully from the very moment of the elections, the first day that you all asked him questions in the Oval Office about violence that might happen and violence that at that point had already happened.<br/> <br/>  I think, again, what you\'ve seen from Ahmadinejad is probably right out of the regime\'s playbook.\xc2\xa0 They were going to -- in many ways, they were going to try to do this regardless of what we said.\xc2\xa0 I think the President, in many ways, disposed of Mr. Ahmadinejad\'s language from the past couple of days at the press avail earlier.\xc2\xa0 I think he has done what he needs to do to ensure that he doesn\'t become a foil by the regime, and I think that\'s been reported by many of your outlets from people believing that in Iran.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that his more forceful presentation, his more forceful words, have had a direct effect on the situation in Iran for the better?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- the President spoke out forcefully against violence from the very beginning.\xc2\xa0 I think those are universal principles that he and many throughout the world community uphold.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue, as they discussed it -- as he discussed it with Chancellor Merkel, and as the G8 has done, continue to speak out on this.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has always made an argument that unilateral engagement makes sense for our -- within Iran -- for our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that he takes issue with some of the ways Iran conducts itself, that regime conducts itself up to this point, yet he still felt that engagement was a good policy.\xc2\xa0 Today he seems to be saying engagement has to be on hold.\xc2\xa0 In any way does that undercut the argument that he\'s made all along, that something has changed?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- again, I think what the President did today was largely reiterate what he\'d said earlier in the week, that we\'re going to -- there obviously are a series of events that have yet to play out in Iran, and we\'ll watch those events play out.\xc2\xa0 I think our long-term interest, as it relates to Iran and the danger in the region remain, quite honestly, no different than they remained the day before the election.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve all witnessed the images since the days of that election, and that\'s I think foremost on the minds of not only this President and this administration, but people throughout the world.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you still believe in engagement as a policy?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does, understanding right now that the Iranians seem preoccupied.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel today spoke directly to the election results in Iran when she said that there should be a re-vote, some kind of recount.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard President Obama say anything like that.\xc2\xa0 Does he agree with Chancellor Merkel on that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a decision that Iranians are going to have to make about their own leadership.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that Chancellor Merkel was going to go further than -- went further than President Obama was prepared to?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to -- I\'ve not been hired to characterize Chancellor Merkel\'s statements.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he said they spoke with one voice.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In condemning the violence.\xc2\xa0 I think you all have heard everything that the President said on this.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How hard is he working this climate bill thing today as the vote approaches?\xc2\xa0 Has he been making calls today?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has made a few calls today, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about anyone else here?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, as I said yesterday I know that the team that works on energy, obviously they\'ve worked throughout this process to get the legislation to the point that it is right now and are working hard to get it through the House and on to the next step of heading into the Senate.\xc2\xa0 They will continue to work that throughout the day.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the energy and interior secretaries still --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they\'re still involved.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the outlook like for it in the Senate, for the climate change legislation?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not being a senator, I don\'t know what the particular -- I don\'t know what particular piece of legislation have thus far been written.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I think a majority of people in the Senate strongly believe that we have to deal with this problem -- dealing with this problem in a way that creates jobs, lessens our dependence on foreign oil, and protects the planet that we live on is something that can help lay the foundation for long-term economic growth and preserve our well-being.<br/> <br/>  So I think that the administration believes that legislation -- it\'s possible to get legislation through the Senate and to his desk.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to get it through the Senate?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Trying to get it over there by getting it through the House.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the Iranian opposition groups are currently on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 The EU has removed them from its list.\xc2\xa0 Would the President consider doing the same?<br/> <br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on that -- we can have somebody at NSC look that up for you.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'re welcome.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said, I believe, that -- or threatened to veto the defense appropriations bill because of F-22 measures.\xc2\xa0 The defense appropriations committee recently increased funding for F-22s.\xc2\xa0 Does the veto threat still stand?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates has outlined a very robust plan to change our defense procurement and to invest in weapons systems and in manpower that make the most sense for the future.\xc2\xa0 He and others have determined that that\'s not part of that program and if that money is contained in the bill, the Secretary of Defense and advisors here, as I said yesterday, would recommend that the President veto that bill, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing, and it may be a little presumptuous now, but Senator Schumer, speaking at Georgetown on Wednesday, said that on the eve of the immigration summit, that a comprehensive immigration bill is what is in order, and he urged the President to go along those lines in his plan to solve the immigration problem.\xc2\xa0 Three years ago comprehensive immigration meant naturalization and border security in one package.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with Senator Schumer, it should be done at once?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to the Legislative Affairs guys in terms of whether this is all contained in one bill or how that\'s all done, except to note this:\xc2\xa0 That whether it is ensuring that there\'s verifiable systems to check employees when they\'re hired, strengthening security at our borders as well as providing that pathway to citizenship -- that all of that represents comprehensive reform, and that the only way to deal with this issue is through that comprehensive reform.<br/> <br/>  Jeff.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wondered if you knew if the President had ever met Michael Jackson in person, or if Mrs. Obama had ever met Michael Jackson?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He did not -- he did not tell me that he had.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe -- I do not believe they have.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a little bit more about Monday\'s --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 About Michael?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not about -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Monday\'s event, gay and lesbian --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I admit I don\'t have a whole lot on it, but yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You spoke about that it\'s going to be a salute to the accomplishment of gay and lesbian Americans.\xc2\xa0 Is this a sign that the President is feeling political heat from this group, that he felt that he should schedule this?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this is an event scheduled around Pride Month.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Around Pride Month?\xc2\xa0 And this is the first time that the White House has done that sort of event here.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This will be the first time we\'ve had Pride Month while we\'re in the White House.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering what -- are we to expect any substantive announcements on the two issues that that community has right at the forefront right now -- Defense of Marriage and "don\'t ask, don\'t tell"?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/> <br/>  Yes.\xc2\xa0 Nothing?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 How was the dunk yesterday?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thankfully the water had warmed up.\xc2\xa0 I will be -- I assume that Bill is not here because he\'s icing his arm.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Either that or a try-out with the Nationals.\xc2\xa0 I would have bet a hefty amount of money that Bill wasn\'t going to dunk me, and I was proven wrong on the very first pitch.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Feller?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Feller, I would have thought had a pretty good shot.\xc2\xa0 But I have to admit, I was not counting on Bill Plante to send me wet.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who else?\xc2\xa0 Let\'s go around, Stephen.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The president of Iraq said that the prime minister would need to strengthen security forces.\xc2\xa0 Is he confident that the security forces as they\'re currently constituted can quell this current wave of violence?\xc2\xa0 And how much is the withdrawal from the cities, of U.S. troops, is sort of a litmus test for how things will go next August, at the end of combat operations in the end of 2011?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as the President mentioned, obviously there is -- while there is always concern about violence in Iraq, that he has certainly spoken to General Odierno and others.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve witnessed the continuing -- certainly if you compare the security situation even now with months ago, the security situation has gotten stronger.<br/> <br/>  But, again, we\'ve got -- we have political progress that has to be made, continued security progress that has to be made.\xc2\xa0 The President and his team -- Ambassador Hill, General Odierno -- believe that we\'re making progress and that we\'re on the pathway to meet our goals.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, we\'ll continue to watch it very, very closely.<br/> <br/>  April.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on Michael Jackson.\xc2\xa0 Understanding that many people viewed him as a complicated mix, you still had other world leaders come out with written statements on Michael Jackson -- to include a leader here in the United States, Arnold Schwarzenegger, written statement; Nelson Mandela, others.\xc2\xa0 Why not issue a written statement for a man who has come to this White House, visited other Presidents, been honored by other Presidents for his humanitarian efforts?\xc2\xa0 He also worked with the Democratic Party, which this President is the head of, helped fundraise.\xc2\xa0 Why not a written statement?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought I did a pretty good job.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at first, yesterday we were told, no statement.\xc2\xa0 Then today you expected us to ask the President.\xc2\xa0 And now there\'s --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you guys are the media.\xc2\xa0 I generally expect -- April, have you never interrupted me to ask a question?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was surprised by the -- maybe I was just surprised.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m getting at --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I watched a little cable today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\'m getting at is why this way?\xc2\xa0 Why now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we pressed you yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We kept asking, we kept asking.\xc2\xa0 And then we were told, no, no, no, no.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think we said that there wasn\'t going to be a statement.\xc2\xa0 So I mean, I asked the President what he thought about it today, and as his spokesman, passed that along to you.<br/> <br/>  Bill.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to the public plan option.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to see comprehensive health reform -- bipartisan, if possible -- with a public plan option.\xc2\xa0 Senator Grassley said two days ago, if you want any Republican votes, no public plan option.\xc2\xa0 So who is driving this train?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which train?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The health reform train, in terms of whether or not there\'s going to be a public plan option?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been very clear on what his priorities are.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President say earlier this week that this is part of -- health care reform is part of a long negotiation.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the public option for those that can\'t afford insurance are offered it through their workplace, that for them a public option provides important choice and competition.\xc2\xa0 But I think both the -- and I would say both -- I think both committees in the Senate are working toward making progress on the President\'s goals.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if Senator Grassley is willing to say, no bill if there\'s a public plan, is the President ready to say, no bill if there\'s not a public plan?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think there are a lot of twists and turns and a lot of negotiating and detail working out between now and getting something to the President\'s desk.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s been clear.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think, to take one -- you know, if you\'re talking Democrats versus Republicans, look, even in the HELP committee, again, which has progress this week I think of over a hundred amendments from Republicans have been adopted throughout the course of the debate in that committee.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\'s evidence that Democrats and Republicans are working together at this point to further some of those goals.<br/> <br/>  David.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two follow-ups from weeks ago.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Uh-oh, wow.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On June 17, Kirk asked you if the President supported the language used in the Justice Department brief in the DOMA case, and you said you would check and get back on that.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s -- well, I can simply say that obviously that was filed by the Solicitor General of this administration.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know the complaints about the particular language --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what you\'re going to say on that?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, I asked last week what, outside the government experts, if any, the President has spoken to about Iran, and you said you would check.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any that -- I think obviously many people in the administration have talked to other members of the administration in and outside of government.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any in particular that the President has spoken to.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on Jeff\'s question from earlier today.\xc2\xa0 He asked the President if --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Michael Jackson one or the -- (laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, he asked the President --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll follow it up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you have more on that, I\'ll take that.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as soon as I get a chance to ask the President if he\'s met Michael, I will.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He asked if the President felt that President Ahmadinejad owed him an apology for comparing him to President Bush, and in his reply, the President all but -- he stopped just short of saying that he thought that President Ahmadinejad owed an apology to his people.\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t quite say that, but would you -- do you think that\'s what he was saying?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d simply point you to what he said.\xc2\xa0 I think he was fairly clear on what he meant and who it was directed to.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up from yesterday -- the question that Kerry asked about that letter from 77 congress people?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, somebody was looking for that, but I don\'t have any -- I don\'t have any new news on that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one more on Iran, please.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Connie.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President said the nuclear clock is ticking.\xc2\xa0 Does that imply a deadline for some sort of military action --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, I\'m not going to certainly get into anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously -- only to say that we continue to have grave concerns about steps that they would take to acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly have nothing that would suggest they\'ve taken any steps not to continue to pursue it.<br/> <br/>  Mike.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Governor Sanford was a very high-profile critic of the stimulus bill.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if the President has been following at all the developments this week or had any reaction to it, either politically or personally?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\'s read it in the paper, but he\'s not given me any particular reaction to it<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Iraq, I was wondering, the President talked about he would like -- how he would like to see more political --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I\'m not trying to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, I got the Iraq part of it.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Jake distracted me.\xc2\xa0 I apologize.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We in the back can\'t see how people in the front are cutting up, so, sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s all get along.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President talked about how he would like to see more political progress in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could express some of the things the President is hoping for and what is he intending to do about that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously he\'s met continually with Ambassador Hill.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the stops -- or the meetings that we made during the stop in Baghdad on the -- I guess that was in late March/early April.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, without getting specific, there continues to be progress in terms of political reconciliation, in terms of oil and hydrocarbons; that as we move throughout a year, a very important year, of elections in Iraq, again, proving that it will take the steps necessary to govern its country.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Goyal.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, please.\xc2\xa0 Recently three top administration officials were speaking at the U.S.-<br/>  India Business Council across the street at the Chamber of Commerce -- Secretary Hillary Clinton, and also Secretary Locke, and the USTR Ambassador Kirk.\xc2\xa0 They had a very clear message as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned.\xc2\xa0 Now since President has invited the Prime Minister of India, is he coming to come before the Pittsburgh G20 conference, a separate visit at the White House, or as part of the -- and also, if President has a new road map for U.S.-India relations?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any news on when a visit might happen.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, as far as immigration issue is concerned, it has been going on for many, many years, including in the last administration, with (inaudible) 245 in the U.S. Congress.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t you think President believes that by giving immigrants legal status it will bring billions of dollars in the U.S. economy and also they will come out of the shadow; and at the same time, they had supported the President during his elections and now they are looking for the next (inaudible) support?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously if you\'re not a legal resident, you couldn\'t have supported the President in the last election.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Their people -- I mean, as far as --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That would have been a little bit more news, Goyal, than we might have wanted to make here -- (laughter) --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I meant immigrants --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- on a Friday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I meant the immigrants, their relatives and their --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President has long been a participant in and a believer in comprehensive reform that strengthen our borders, ensured that he worked with Senator Grassley on legislation creating a database to check for employment to ensure that employers weren\'t abusing the system, as well as taking steps to bring people out of the shadows, having them learn English, having them go to the back of the line.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  And I think some of the stuff that\'s come out of yesterday\'s meeting also is that for the first time, we\'re going to take some steps to ensure that those that are in the immigration process, which in years past has been backed up considerably, that we provide some ability for people to check where in that process they are.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s important to ensure a safe and orderly system.<br/> <br/>  Have a good weekend, guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  2:50 P.M. <br/>  \xc2\xa0</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
