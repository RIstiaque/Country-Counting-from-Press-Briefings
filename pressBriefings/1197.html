EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, how\xe2\x80\x99s everybody doing today? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good, and you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to start off just by reminding people first of all that the event the President is doing today in Boston at a remarkable school called TechBoston with Secretary Duncan and Domestic Policy Advisor Melody Barnes is meant to -- and Melinda Gates, of course -- is meant to highlight how the education and innovation aspects of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda come together in a place like this where, through philanthropy and businesses and educational leadership, a school like TechBoston was created, which is doing remarkable work towards providing students in Boston the kind of education they need to secure the jobs of the future in the industries that the President talks about all the time, that he thinks are key to winning the future, the economic future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I start with Libya and the no-fly zone?\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain again today pushing for that.\xc2\xa0 Do you -- and there is a risk, as people in Congress are calling for action for the United States, that the White House is kind of dragging its feet a little bit or appears to be.\xc2\xa0 Do you think Congress is getting ahead of itself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say, Alister, that the President has been clear, as he was just as recently as yesterday, that we are considering all options, including military options.\xc2\xa0 He made reference to the meetings in Brussels at NATO.\xc2\xa0 And -- but we have also already taken significant steps, both unilaterally and with our international partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what I also pointed out yesterday is that there are complexities and realities involved in the adoption and implementation of a measure like a no-fly zone that we all need to be aware of as we consider it.\xc2\xa0 It is an option we are actively considering.\xc2\xa0 It is also one that carries with it complexities and other things that need to be -- everyone needs to be aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 In terms of sort of committing U.S. military assets to implementing a no-fly zone, if he decides to do that, the White House has said that it wants this to be an international operation.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean it has to have the imprinture of a U.N. Security Council resolution?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of myself, and certainly not ahead of the President, in speaking to the formula by which we would reach a decision or implement a decision that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even made yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are currently working with our international partners on a number of measures, including ones that involve humanitarian assistance, as well as the very serious sanctions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve leveled.\xc2\xa0 So our interest is in working with our international partners going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the options being considered sending any kind of U.S. envoy or delegation to meet with the two sides in Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what does the President think about this alleged outreach that Qaddafi has made to rebels and opposition forces?\xc2\xa0 Is that anything that you guys give any credence to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports, but beyond that I would just say that the President has made clear that we believe that Colonel Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s time has come, or time has ended, rather, in power, and he needs to step down and step aside for the sake and the benefit of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 How that comes about should be decided by the Libyan people, but it needs to happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that education question?\xc2\xa0 CBS is reporting that the Commencement Challenge is not going as well as perhaps expected, and certainly not as well as the last time.\xc2\xa0 Is that an embarrassment given all the attention that the President is giving to education?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that the Commencement Challenge last year was a fantastic process that led to a terrific event that showcased a school in Kalamazoo, and we expect the same to happen this time.\xc2\xa0 We have a large number of applicants and we look forward to a process that will produce a winner and a commencement speech from the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how many applicants you have at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the budget -- this morning, Senator Manchin had some pretty strong words on the President in basically saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s been failing to lead on spending.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any comment on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that the President of the United States put forth a budget -- so far the only budget we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, fiscal year 2012 -- that contains within it a five-year freeze on non-security discretionary spending, the result of which is a $400 billion cut over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The overall budget produces a trillion dollars in savings over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 His leadership and seriousness about the need to live within our means, cut spending where we must, or where we can, rather, is quite clear.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is a process in Congress unfold to which it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming quite clear, as we saw I think in the Senate, that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a consensus behind the measure passed by the House Republicans H.R. 1, and there may not be one behind the Senate Democratic bill. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we need is votes on both those so we can see whether or not a consensus exists.\xc2\xa0 And if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, for either of those measures, which as you know are roughly $100 billion in cuts off of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposed 2011 baseline budget for the H.R. 1, and $51.5 billion in cuts off of the same baseline that the Senate Democratic bill.\xc2\xa0 If neither of those produces a consensus, then the clear indication is we need to come together, everyone needs to move off their starting position, as the President clearly has, and resolve this.\xc2\xa0 And I think we can.\xc2\xa0 The President remains optimistic that we can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask, Jay -- the President, with so much going on with the budget issue, with the crisis in the Middle East, he\xe2\x80\x99s been to a lot of schools lately, and he\xe2\x80\x99s sticking rather doggedly to this schedule of flying out to Miami, to Boston and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 Is there a point at which you worry that this is taking up a lot of time?\xc2\xa0 And is there an opportunity cost?\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s doing this, is he not in Washington doing something else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, because the President feels very strongly that education and education reform is an economics and a jobs issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear in any way that you evaluate the data that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have children being educated and graduating high school and moving on to higher education in the numbers that are necessary for the industries of tomorrow, then we cannot lead economically in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t -- countries that out-educate us out-compete us, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he is so committed to pursuing education reform because education is important in its own right; it is also vital to our economic future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very high priority.\xc2\xa0 And as you know from the way we travel now, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that prevents him when he\xe2\x80\x99s on the road from being in constant communication with the White House and others in Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President made a decision on who he\xe2\x80\x99s going to nominate to be the next ambassador to China?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any announcements by the President.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that is a post that we know will be vacant relatively soon.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a vital post so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will move with dispatch to fill it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is an announcement coming soon?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the budget, given there is a difference of $50-some billion between the House bill and what the President and the Democrats have offered, can you -- I mean, accepting that both will likely be defeated in the Senate, can you move halfway on those numbers?\xc2\xa0 I mean, can you come together -- can you come together on $25 billion that makes up that difference?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a budget negotiator.\xc2\xa0 What the President has made clear, what Senate Democrats have made clear, is that they have put skin in the game.\xc2\xa0 They have made proposals that have moved them off of their initial position here.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to a negotiation process where everyone recognizes that we need to come together and find common ground.\xc2\xa0 Where that ground exists precisely I think depends very much on the details that can be negotiated.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think what is important is that we need to move -- the Senate needs to move and have those votes.\xc2\xa0 And the House passed a bill that had broad support by House Republicans and now there\xe2\x80\x99s a holdup in the Senate in voting on that bill, which I think needs to be overcome quickly so that we can then proceed to find that common ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Kuwait called today in the context of OPEC to increase production to help make up for the shortfall from Libya.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States -- would the United States welcome an increase from OPEC oil output?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t address that specifically.\xc2\xa0 I will just say that we obviously are monitoring closely and are mindful of the rise in oil prices, and we are in regular discussions with the IEA and oil-producing countries about the situation.\xc2\xa0 And the global system has a variety of means of dealing with a major disruption should that occur, so -- but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment specifically on the Kuwaiti action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, in going back, circling back to no-fly for just a moment, Ivo Daalder yesterday suggested in that conference call that because of the volume of flights they were seeing having maybe peaked last week, that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear that a no-fly zone was as critical or central as many people are saying; that there might be other things that are equally or more important.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- can you comment on that at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I actually said something about that yesterday in my briefing, and I think our ambassador to NATO clearly makes a well-informed point.\xc2\xa0 And you know they had this -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve been having discussions at NATO about the variety of options.\xc2\xa0 And obviously you need to, as you adopt measures, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a no-fly zone or any other measure, you need to game out what it is you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve and how effective the measure will be in reaching that goal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that our ambassador, Mr. Daalder, was simply making the point that we need to know for sure that if we were to pursue a no-fly zone -- again, or any other option that\xe2\x80\x99s still on the table -- that it will have the kind of effect we hope.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?\xc2\xa0 A member of the German parliament said today that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was possible for a no-fly zone to be effective without the inclusion of at least one Muslim state and collaboration from the Arab League.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view on the importance of having a Muslim country involved in any kind of no-fly zone enforcement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without speaking to the -- that proposal specifically, the White House, the President, feels strongly that it has been significant and valuable that the international community has spoken with one voice on events in Libya and has acted together, and that the United States has acted together with so many of its international partners.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specifically on what -- our posture on the question you asked.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>\n\t2:18 P.M.
