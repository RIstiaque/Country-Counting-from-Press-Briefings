Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:52 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get started, I just wanted to make mention of the fact that this morning, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it has sent warning letters to 1,200 businesses suspected of selling cigarettes and tobacco to children.\xc2\xa0 These letters came after an aggressive inspection campaign, and remind retailers of their legal responsibility to protect our children.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama is committed to protecting children from cigarettes, and this action is only one part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s effort to stop children from smoking before they start.\xc2\xa0 In 2009, President Obama was proud to sign the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which gives us new tools to prevent kids from smoking -- including graphic warning labels that make the risks of cigarette smoking clear to anyone thinking about picking up a pack.</p>\n<p>\n\tTobacco companies have gone to court to stop these labels, and were disappointed by a recent ruling in this matter.\xc2\xa0 Tobacco companies shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be standing in the way of common-sense measures that will help prevent children from smoking.\xc2\xa0 But we are confident that big tobacco\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to stop these warnings from going forward will ultimately fail.</p>\n<p>\n\tAssociated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Are you able to confirm that the administration is going to delay a decision on the Keystone Pipeline while it studies the possibility of another route?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, as you know and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, that process of review is housed within the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I expect that any decision about the status of that process or any announcement that might be made about that will come from the State Department.\xc2\xa0 So I would direct you to Foggy Bottom for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House been told anything by the State Department that a decision --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the State Department.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s their obligation, responsibility to make announcements about processes.\xc2\xa0 So I think if you direct your attention over there, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find what you need.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President like to see a decision on this pushed back until after the 2012 election, given that so many of his supporters oppose the pipeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President wants the best possible decision.\xc2\xa0 And I think he made clear in an interview the week before last what he views are the criteria necessary by which to judge whether the decision is the right one or how to make that decision, including issues of public health, climate change, economic growth and jobs.\xc2\xa0 All of these things have to be factored in to a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that process, as you know, and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, is run out of the State Department and in accordance with an executive order that was signed during the previous administration; also in accordance with decades of previous practice.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is an open process, however.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not made in a vacuum.\xc2\xa0 And the State Department takes input from -- in this process -- from the public, as well as stakeholders, as well as many agencies within the executive branch.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President fully expects that the decisions that -- decision or decisions made by the State Department will reflect his views.\xc2\xa0 It is the Obama administration, after all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly, on one other topic.\xc2\xa0 In Italy, it looks like the Italian government is going to ask Berlusconi to step aside perhaps as early as Monday, and get the new government in place.\xc2\xa0 Is the President supportive of that quick turnover in Italy, in order to get a hold of their debt crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you, Julie, that the President spoke with President Napolitano this morning about the situation in Italy.\xc2\xa0 He expressed confidence in President Napolitano\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to put an interim government in place in Italy that will implement an aggressive reform program and restore market confidence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlister.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, are you able to read out any other calls that the President has made to leaders in Europe today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other calls to announce or read out at this moment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And turning to the special committee -- does the President detect that the committee is making any progress?\xc2\xa0 And does he intend to step in at all to help them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me make a couple of points about that.\xc2\xa0 The President participated in great detail in prolonged negotiations with Congress, with Republican leaders in Congress, over the summer, as did the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 He participated in very quiet, specific negotiations with the Speaker of the House to resolve our long-term and medium-term deficit and debt problems.\xc2\xa0 And his views, and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s views on these matters are quite well known by those who are trying to make decisions now.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that -- and then, of course, he -- when the Speaker was unable to reach a deal to -- walked away from the table on the so-called grand bargain, in the end, what was important was that we made sure the debt ceiling was raised and we did not default on our obligations, and that we pushed back -- that we absolutely refused to go down the road that Republicans wanted us to go down -- or some did -- which is having the circus of raising the debt ceiling occur again this year, or every six months -- whatever it is that they wanted.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President successfully negotiated that in the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 And that act contained within it the provision that set up the super committee, by Congress, creating a congressional committee with members of Congress, appointed by the leaders of both houses and both parties to come to a resolution in a bipartisan way on a medium- and long-term deficit and debt reduction plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen that process began, as you know, the President laid out, in detail, living within our means and investing in the future -- his detailed, comprehensive proposal for medium- and long-term deficit and debt control.\xc2\xa0 His views are well known.\xc2\xa0 He I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will have conversations with members of Congress of both parties in the future about what he thinks they ought to do.\xc2\xa0 But what he will probably refer them to are some of the page numbers in this very document.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the irony of the situation we\xe2\x80\x99re in here is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not that hard to figure out how we get from here to there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he seeing any progress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the first part of your question which I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to now.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly a step in the right direction that Republicans are actually uttering the R-word now, at least some of them, because there is no credible way to achieve significant deficit and debt reduction if it\xe2\x80\x99s not balanced.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no way fair to do it, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have revenue, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask the wealthiest among us, those who have done the best over the past 10 years while the middle class has really struggled to pay their fair share, then you have to do what was in the House Republican budget proposal, the Ryan plan, and ask seniors to bear all the burden, ask families with disabled children to shoulder the burden.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not acceptable to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you have to be balanced.\xc2\xa0 You have to look at all aspects of federal spending -- through entitlements, through discretionary spending, through defense spending, through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 To the extent that Republicans are willing now to at least speak the word, entertain the idea, acknowledge that it has to be part of this process, that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 Proposals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far I think are a long way from achieving the kind of fairness that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 But progress is progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Anybody in the back?\xc2\xa0 You guys there.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to protesters who say that the White House and attorneys general are being too soft on the details that have come out about settlements with banks who may have exhibited unlawful foreclosure practices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about a settlement that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been achieved or announced as far as I know, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tSam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch the debate last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I spent some time with him this morning.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up, although I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure, based on what I understand, he did not see it.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No thoughts on Governor Perry\xe2\x80\x99s night?\xc2\xa0 Or perhaps Mr. Cain\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From him or from me?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, either.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- actually I know from our conversation that he did not see the debate.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think -- our interest in this, to the extent that we have the time to pay attention to it, is in the policy issues, and what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the debates and from the candidates are economic proposals; proposals designed to address the very issues that are the most important to the American people right now are economic proposals that look awfully similar to the ones that got us into this mess:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s give more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans; let\xe2\x80\x99s throw -- prevent 30 million Americans from getting health insurance; let\xe2\x80\x99s reduce regulations in a way that means that our kids don\xe2\x80\x99t have clean air to breathe or clean water to drink; let\xe2\x80\x99s do all that and assume that everything is going to be fine.</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, we tried that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been cleaning up quite a mess as a result.</p>\n<p>\n\tJill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 If I could go back on Keystone again.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is not saying anything today, at least so far.\xc2\xa0 And I normally cover the State Department, so I\xe2\x80\x99m over here trying to get some more information.\xc2\xa0 Because, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They sent you here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They did, on a mission from God, to find out more information about Keystone.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Because, ultimately, it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility.\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton makes that determination, but does the President still have confidence in that process?\xc2\xa0 Because already we have the Inspector General conducting a special review.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has great confidence in the Secretary of State, and he has confidence in a process that will take into account the criteria that he publicly said were very important and he believes need to be taken into account as this review is conducted and these decisions are made and these determinations are made.\xc2\xa0 And he made clear that when that determination is made, it will certainly reflect his views, because this is his administration.\xc2\xa0 The State Department doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make this in a vacuum; the State Department is part of the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is a process that they run for a lot of very important reasons, as you understand, because you cover the State Department.\xc2\xa0 So I will send you back to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And I think you will find there the answer that you are looking for when it comes to announcements about process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other one on another subject.\xc2\xa0 The IAEA report that came out on Iran this week -- the Russians are really slamming it, saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s tantamount to regime change, an attempt at regime change.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at Russia and the reset, one of the main elements of the reset was the cooperation that Russia was providing to the United States on Iran.\xc2\xa0 If that is suddenly falling apart, what does that mean to the reset?\xc2\xa0 Is the reset dead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, not at all.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, all of us in the P5-plus-1 share -- stand firm together in our belief that an Iran armed with nuclear weapons is an intolerable threat to regional and international security, and we remain determined to prevent that outcome.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, we share a strategic goal with Russia.\xc2\xa0 And our efforts with Russia have produced a situation, and our efforts with international partners everywhere have produced a situation where Iran is now suffering, if you will -- the regime is -- from the most stringent set of sanctions, the most stringent sanctions regime that it has ever faced.\xc2\xa0 And that pressure and that isolation is having an effect, as you know, because I know you cover these issues pretty closely.\xc2\xa0 And it is because of the kind of cooperation and consensus that this President has been able to achieve internationally that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to do that with regards to Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will continue to work with the Russians and others on this process, and we will continue to isolate and pressure Iran to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I was wondering if you could comment on, first of all, the White House refusal to comply with Republicans in Congress asking for all documents related to Solyndra to be turned over to them by noon today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that deadline was not met.\xc2\xa0 And then also, Republicans in Congress are saying that some of the emails they have uncovered indicate that the White House has not been forthcoming about the conversations that those behind the Solyndra business have had with people at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And I can cite those emails if you want, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have, thank you, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, we have been enormously cooperative with legitimate oversight, in this area and others.\xc2\xa0 In this investigation alone, we\xe2\x80\x99ve turned over 85,000 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to cooperate with this committee investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the issue of the subpoena that you referenced, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce about any release made to the Hill yet, but I can say that, as the White House counsel made clear in her letter, this is something we view as overbroad, unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think in my words, when something seems partisan it probably is, and in this case, when we hear the Speaker of the House saying that he will -- they will -- the Republicans -- be \xe2\x80\x9crelentless in pursuing this oversight investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d I think most American people wish they would be as relentless in taking measures to help the economy and create jobs as they are in trying to create a political issue out of something that is simply a policy decision, and policy decisions that were made on -- merit-based decisions out of the Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about some of the items in the specific emails that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear:\xc2\xa0 Republicans know -- what the episode in the last 24 hours shows I think reinforces the idea that this is becoming a political football and a partisan effort.\xc2\xa0 They cherry-pick some documents and try to make hay out of something that, when looked at in its entirety, only reinforces what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, which is that there was no political influence in the decision-making progress -- process that led to the loan guarantee for Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the meeting that they\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware, took place almost a year after the loan was approved -- okay?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Kaiser has said both I believe to committee members, both Republicans and Democrats, and in public, again, that he would not discuss the loan with members of this administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we have cooperated with legitimate oversight on this matter and others.\xc2\xa0 We are now 85,000 pages into this process, nine committee staff briefings, four congressional hearings; the donor in question has been interviewed and the investors have released their documents.\xc2\xa0 And this is what the Republicans could find.\xc2\xa0 Again, at some point they have to focus I think on the things that the American people care about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an advisor that Kaiser quoted in one of the emails saying \xe2\x80\x9cThe White House has offered to help in the past and we do have a contact at the White House that we are working with.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And Republicans are citing that as an example that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this was a meeting that took place -- again, this was either emails from outside the administration; all of their review of emails from internally have produced none of this, of what they want to be there, and they have clearly been gravely disappointed by that.\xc2\xa0 The meeting that is referenced here took place almost I think 11 months after the loan guarantee went out the door.\xc2\xa0 And the donor in question here -- the investor in question here, Mr. Kaiser, has been explicitly clear about saying that he never discussed this loan with administration officials, White House officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that Dennis Ross is leaving the administration?\xc2\xa0 And when did he first indicate that he would be leaving, and do you have a replacement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that he is leaving.\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that he, like a lot of folks, especially somebody who has served as frequently over the years as he has, had committed to staying two years and then ended up, because of everything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen in the region of the world that he focuses on, stayed for almost three.\xc2\xa0 Dennis has been a remarkable contributor to this administration.\xc2\xa0 He is -- going back to the questions we were discussing just now with Jill about Iran -- very much a part and an architect of the sanctions regime and the effort to pressure and isolate Iran, and has been at the forefront of our deliberations about handling the Arab Spring, the remarkable events we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the Middle East and North Africa this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I believe there might have been a statement that\xe2\x80\x99s been put out already on this, but he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly served his country and this administration and this President very well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how does it reflect on the Mideast peace process in general, though, that he\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that Dennis Ross, somebody with his remarkable experience and long service, stayed as long as he did, given how much he\xe2\x80\x99s -- how often he\xe2\x80\x99s served in the past I think is testimony to his dedication to the issues that he\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in for so many years, his dedication to the administration, to this President.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can expect us to build on the good work that he\xe2\x80\x99s done here going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All signs point to, on Keystone, this 12-to-18 month delay.\xc2\xa0 How do you think -- I mean, how does that reflect on where the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kate, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of any announcements that may or may not be coming from the State Department, where this process is being run.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some environmentalists and union labor leaders are saying this seems very political, that he\xe2\x80\x99s just punting to past the election --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- I can tell you the President made clear what the criteria are; they all have to be considered.\xc2\xa0 And he expects that the State Department is considering those criteria as it reviews this issue and as it makes determinations about it.\xc2\xa0 And none of those criteria are political.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President have any reaction to the outcome of the vote in Ohio on Tuesday on collective bargaining?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we put out a statement, and I think this President firmly believes that Americans should enjoy collective bargaining rights and he was certainly pleased by the results of that vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the vote in Mississippi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were also pleased by the vote in Mississippi because of the need to protect women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive rights and protect their capacity to make decisions about their own health.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate is scheduled to approve part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s American Jobs Act, the part that would help veterans who are looking for jobs and give tax breaks to companies to hire them.\xc2\xa0 This, however, though, is not being paid for by any additional revenues raised or tax increases on the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to sign this legislation, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do support it, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will the President support additional pieces of his jobs act that are passed by Congress that don\xe2\x80\x99t include raising taxes on millionaires?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the way you phrase it is very useful, so I appreciate the question, Norah.\xc2\xa0 The President will sign legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s paid for in a fair way, and if this bill passes, we support it.\xc2\xa0 What he will not do is sign legislation that adds to the burden already borne by the middle class that requires -- you drew the lines very clearly.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are voting for this -- why?\xc2\xa0 Well, we hope because it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, but we know from past experience in terms of the things that they used to support that every provision within the jobs act is a good idea.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote for this one in your words because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include a requirement that millionaires and billionaires pay a little bit extra.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s their bottom line I guess is the way you\xe2\x80\x99re putting it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe certainly hope that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case when it comes to putting 400,000 teachers back to work, or building -- rebuilding our bridges and highways and schools, or giving and extending -- extending and expanding a tax cut to 160 million Americans, $1,500 on average for each American family.\xc2\xa0 If their standard is those are only -- those are good ideas but not if we have to ask millionaires to pay a little more, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to explain that to the American people because that\xe2\x80\x99s not a standard that they support.\xc2\xa0 Their own constituents do not support that approach, do not support that point of view.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said pay for in a fair way, but it\xe2\x80\x99s being paid for, my understanding is, by extending a fee the Veterans Affairs Department charges to back home loans.\xc2\xa0 Is that fair?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we support the legislation.\xc2\xa0 We obviously believe very strongly that we need to make -- take efforts to help veterans who have been fighting for us come back to the country and not have to fight for a job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just interested -- I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in the pay-fors on that, and also because of the withholding tax --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I get it, Norah.\xc2\xa0 And I said that we support the bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the withholding tax, which is part of that, too, my understanding is that\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost the government $11 billion over the next decade.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be made up by lost revenue, by making it harder for some Social Security beneficiaries to qualify for Medicaid, which, of course, affects low-income people.\xc2\xa0 So the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Norah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the details on this.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you that we strongly support --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is going to sign something that makes it harder for people to get Medicaid?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what the bill looks like, if and when it passes, okay?\xc2\xa0 Our principles have been clear.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about this President put forward and what Democrats in the Senate have put forward, and how those very sensible and effective solutions to economic growth and job creation would be paid for, as we see it; what we think is the preferred option.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll review every alternative proposal that comes forward and make decisions accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But we firmly believe, given what we knew already and what we now know even more to be the case about who has had the hardest time in the last 10 years -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the middle class, who has had the most -- who has benefited the most from the greatness of this country over the past 30 years, and asking them merely to pay a little bit extra so that we can put Americans back to work and grow the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, just a last question on this.\xc2\xa0 You just laid it out very clearly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s principle is on this jobs act, and who should be paying more, who should pay their fair share to put forward this jobs bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Norah, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions about the specifics of this pay-for.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more specifics to give you.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the President now giving ground, so that members up on Capitol Hill can find pay-fors in some other way that don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s principle of the wealthier paying their fair share, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it if they can just find some other way to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, not if they can find some other way.\xc2\xa0 It still has to meet a standard, and that standard will be applied.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, before when you said that sanctions against Iran are the most stringent, after the IAEA report came out, your answer -- officials here said you were going to have even tougher sanctions to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 Now you have Russia and China both saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sign on to new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re consulting with our partners and allies.\xc2\xa0 The conclusions that the report draws are alarming and they reinforce what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying about Iranian behavior.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMoving forward, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that we are looking at additional ways to apply pressure on Iran, because the onus is on Iran to address the questions raised by the international community about the intent of its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that we are looking at ways to apply even greater pressure on Iran as a consequence of their refusal to live up to, rather, their international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a few days since it was reported that in a private conversation, President Sarkozy called the Prime Minister of Israel a liar, and President Obama did not disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 Why have you not put out a statement saying -- disagree with this, that this is unfortunate --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I assume you were part of the briefing yesterday -- I think you were -- where we talked about this at some length.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to comment on a reported conversation, a private conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel, to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, is unquestioned -- not just by us, but by the Israelis, by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, who has said on the record that the things that this administration has done to ensure Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security are -- have not -- have been greater than any other administration.\xc2\xa0 So -- and other officials in Israel have said so, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur relationship with Israel is based on our shared principles, our shared values, and obviously on our mutual interests in terms of security.\xc2\xa0 And we will stick by Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 Following on Jake, on Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 One of the emails he was talking about, March 2010, George Kaiser told a board member of Solyndra that he had had a meeting at the White House -- he stressed the White House, not the Department of Energy, in the email.\xc2\xa0 He said Solyndra came up; every one of them responded simultaneously about their thorough knowledge of the Solyndra story, suggesting it was one of their prime poster children.\xc2\xa0 How does that square with you saying in September, in this very room, that George Kaiser did not lobby on Solyndra at all, and as you put it, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was involved in charitable efforts\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to what you just said and what I just said in response to the question.\xc2\xa0 March 2010 -- do you remember when the loan was approved?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was after the loan was approved, but before the loan was restructured.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So he was supposedly lobbying -- but he was supposedly lobbying for a loan that had already been approved almost a year before.\xc2\xa0 Second --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Solyndra was later lobbying to restructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- he never said, in that email or any other discussion -- and certainly never said before the Republicans and Democrats in the committee, based on what we know -- in fact, he made quite clear that he never lobbied for the loan.\xc2\xa0 And this is an effort by Republicans to create a political story out of something that is not providing them what they want, which is any evidence that anything but merit-based decisions were made at the Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will you at least acknowledge that his -- George Kaiser\xe2\x80\x99s meetings here were not just about his charity; they were about Solyndra as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, what I -- let\xe2\x80\x99s go back also, since you\xe2\x80\x99re quoting me erroneously:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I said, Ed, if I could:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI would point you simply to what George Kaiser himself has said:\xc2\xa0 That he did not lobby or discuss; he did not lobby administration officials with regard to this while with Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 He was involved in a lot of charitable efforts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding that while we haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into every meeting that he might have had here, that that was the focus of his conversations, generally speaking, at the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about emails that were not sent to or from here, characterizations of meetings not made by people who were here.\xc2\xa0 What I can point you to is that George Kaiser himself, with the committee, reaffirmed in his words that he never lobbied this administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the firing of Joe Paterno was merited?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into the decisions made by the university.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that if the allegations about what happened up there prove true, that what happened is outrageous.\xc2\xa0 And our -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and prayers, and all of our thoughts and prayers, are with the victims of the abuse and the family members of those victims.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back on Dennis Ross, can you categorically state that he did not resign as a result of any friction within the administration, particularly on Iranian policy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can categorically deny that, yes.\xc2\xa0 Unless -- yes, I can deny that.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, of the 13 days before the joint select committee deadline, the President is going to be traveling for nine of them.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason that the President\xe2\x80\x99s presence in Washington might positively influence the outcome in that time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The outcome of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The super committee.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about what the super committee is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a congressional committee, established by an act of Congress, written by members of Congress, to include members of Congress -- not administration officials, not the President -- to do their job.\xc2\xa0 And their job is not as hard as a lot of people make it out to be.\xc2\xa0 They need to basically come together around some common-sense solutions to our medium- and long-term deficit and debt problems and challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tA common-sense approach would be a balanced approach -- one that includes cuts and reforms, but also includes revenues; and that asks those who have done the best, especially in the last 10 years, to pay a little bit extra; those who benefited from the very unpaid-for tax cuts that helped create the deficit and debt that we face now.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe believes and hopes that the committee will do its job; that Congress will do its job, and that it will reach a resolution that is fair and balanced, that Congress can pass and that he can sign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I said earlier, his views on this are well known.\xc2\xa0 They are enshrined in this document, provided to the super committee, to all members of Congress and to every member of the public who\xe2\x80\x99s interested, back in September.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this not a case of where\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan, a refrain I remember hearing from some of you all this summer, because the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan has been out there for everybody to see and to use as a road map to getting to the necessary destination.\xc2\xa0 The President, whenever he travels, is able to be in contact with Washington, with his administration and with members of Congress as necessary.\xc2\xa0 That will certainly be the case if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is nothing here -- there is no obstacle to Congress getting its job done if they demonstrate a little political will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I know that you said the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t watch the debate, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that, like most people, he got the takeaway.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s thought on eliminating the Departments of Commerce, Education and the department to be named later?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think our view of the debates and the primary process underway in the Republican Party is simply focused on policy proposals and what solutions are being put forward to the challenges that we face as a country, principally the economic challenges and the jobs challenge that we face.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far is a real paucity of new ideas.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is Xeroxed policy proposals, the likes of which we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen put forward and adopted in the previous decade that contributed so greatly to the economic crisis that we faced in 2008 and 2009.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus.\xc2\xa0 To the extent that we are paying attention at this point and we will be paying more attention later, and we aren\xe2\x80\x99t paying great attention now, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the policy proposals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The elimination of three departments isn\xe2\x80\x99t Xeroxed from any particular --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Putting aside the incident that that refers to, I think that this President is for serious policy solutions and not bumper stickers.\xc2\xa0 And that has been demonstrated -- I get to pull it out a third time -- by the comprehensive nature of the kind of policy proposals he puts forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have copies of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys have this, yes.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to provide it again, although, perhaps online, because we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in saving money around here.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cWe Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait\xe2\x80\x9d a bumper sticker policy?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s backed up by serious substance.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the IAEA report makes clear that Iran has made considerable progress towards obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And during quite a lot of that time, they have been subject to what you describe as \xe2\x80\x9cstringent sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So would you agree that those sanctions have not been effective in deterring them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would agree that those sanctions have been stringent.\xc2\xa0 They have had a dramatic impact on the Iranian economy, and have put great strain on the regime as a result of that.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly the objective in the sense that the objective is to put pressure on Iran to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to take measures, working with our international partners, to put added pressure on Iran and make clear to Iran that they need to get right with the world and live up to their obligations with regards to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to pursue that going forward in the wake of this very alarming report.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But so far they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any effect, it seems, on their nuclear program and its progress.\xc2\xa0 Or if they have it\xe2\x80\x99s been minimal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s had an impact on the regime.\xc2\xa0 I think those who cover Iran closely can speak at length about the kind of pressure that the international sanctions regime has placed on Iran and on the regime.\xc2\xa0 And the President himself, of Iran, recently admitted as much.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to ratchet up the pressure to encourage and urge Iran to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ayatollah Khamenei said today that any attack on Iran by Israel or the United States would be met with an iron fist.\xc2\xa0 Do you have response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My response is simply that Iran should live up to its international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you articulate the diplomatic strategy toward Iran, you seem to keep leaving out this big middle step.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if it\xe2\x80\x99s continue to increase the pressure to lead to isolation, is eventually supposed to lead to them withdrawing any aggressive nuclear intentions, what\xe2\x80\x99s the middle step?\xc2\xa0 What leads one to the other?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s about predicting the future and where the tipping point is.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that the pressure has --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The strategy is intention.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have the intention, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The intention is to change behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So how?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By ratcheting up pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 Are you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to take measures.\xc2\xa0 And I think in response to a question about what our next steps will be, I made clear that there will be next steps but I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to announce them today.\xc2\xa0 But we will enhance the pressure, enhance the isolation, and Iran will feel that.\xc2\xa0 And it will have an effect on the Iranian economy and on the Iranian leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will those next steps be diplomatic?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are pursuing a diplomatic channel.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case, as we have said all along, that we take no options off the table; and that remains the case today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is quiet in the room.\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s he going to root for tomorrow in that ball game on the deck of the Vinson?\xc2\xa0 Michigan or North Carolina?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0 He may talk about it tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just -- since he brought that up, can you just tell us a little bit about why he\xe2\x80\x99s going to see that game?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to tell you about it now, except that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty exciting, and the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s taking place on the USS Vinson is doubly exciting.\xc2\xa0 And I think he will take the opportunity to honor American servicemen and women for their tremendous service and sacrifice to this country.\xc2\xa0 He will certainly use this as an occasion to do that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details about it tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Following up on something you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked previously -- last night after the debate, the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection team sent out a number of comments about Romney\xe2\x80\x99s comments last night.\xc2\xa0 Given the developments in the recent days, is the administration ready to say that you do see Romney as the eventual frontrunner nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is not for us to decide who will be the nominee of the other party.\xc2\xa0 We will leave that to, as we should, the voters in the primaries and caucuses to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur views on this are pretty limited to an examination of the policy proposals that the candidates, both leading and otherwise, have put forward.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen is a remarkable uniformity to the idea that the way to emerge from the crisis is to repeat the policies that got us into it.\xc2\xa0 In our view that\xe2\x80\x99s not a great solution.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has the President at least seen the news clips of the brain freeze?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- when I spoke with him this morning, he had not seen any of the debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:36 P.M.
