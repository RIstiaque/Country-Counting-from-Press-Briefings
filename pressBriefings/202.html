Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I apologize for the late start for the briefing today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you -- in the spirit of the day. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, thank you. \xc2\xa0I\'m humbled by that expression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn from it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well done. \xc2\xa0Well done. \xc2\xa0It was a powerful morning on the South Lawn of the White House. \xc2\xa0I know many of you were hard at work covering it, but I hope that at least some of you were able to get outside and enjoy the beautiful day but also to soak in the spirit that was on such nice display this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut other than that, I don\'t have any opening comments, so we can go straight to your questions. \xc2\xa0Darlene, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, thank you. \xc2\xa0What do you have for us on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Pope -- how long the meeting lasted, what they talked about? \xc2\xa0Was it just the two of them in the Oval? Those kind of details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a transcript. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, Bill, it will be disappointing to you, there was no stenographer in the room while the President was there. \xc2\xa0It actually was a one-on-one meeting between the Pope and the President. \xc2\xa0And that\'s obviously going to limit my ability to offer you a detailed readout, primarily because it was intended to be a private conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt did last about 40 minutes. \xc2\xa0And I think that all of you, or at least your representatives in the pool, did have an opportunity to observe at least the beginning of that discussion. You saw the two men walking through the Colonnade of the White House, and the President stopped on a couple of occasions to describe the surroundings to the Pope who was visiting the White House for the first time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President certainly did enjoy the opportunity to play host today and it was an opportunity for the President to show the Pope around the White House, to introduce the Pope to senior members of his staff -- the Catholic members of his staff did have an opportunity to have one-on-one interaction with the Pope. \xc2\xa0So this was a visit that the President genuinely enjoyed. But I\'m unable to give you much detail about their private discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How pleased would you say the President was, or how pleased is the White House that the Pope went directly to climate change, the issue of climate change in his remarks here on this first visit to the U.S. and to the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the Pope did have some kind words for the President\xe2\x80\x99s work on this issue, and the President certainly welcomed that expression from the Pope. \xc2\xa0I think in general -- this is something that we said in the lead-up to the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit and I think it continues to be true today -- that the goal of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit and certainly the goal of the meeting was not to advance anyone\xe2\x80\x99s political agenda. \xc2\xa0And I think that listening to the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s comments, it was clear that he was speaking with a passion and a conviction about the need to act on climate issues that was deeply rooted in his faith. \xc2\xa0So he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t seeking to deliver a political message; he was speaking from the heart and with a moral conviction that I think will resonate with people all around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Having him talk about climate change, how do you see what he said here today -- do you see that in any way influencing the debate going forward or even next steps from the White House on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think time will tell. \xc2\xa0And I think the Pope himself acknowledged that -- acknowledged the opportunity that people around the world have to seize this opportunity. \xc2\xa0And the Pope did make a conscious decision to capitalize on this high-profile moment to deliver this message. \xc2\xa0These were obviously the first public statements that he offered on American soil. \xc2\xa0It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as if he thought that no one would be listening.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\'ll have additional opportunities over the next five days of his visit to deliver additional messages that he seeks to prioritize, and I think the next big one that\'s coming up will be the speech that he\'ll deliver before Congress tomorrow. \xc2\xa0And he made a brief allusion to his desire to offer some encouragement to the members of that body as they try to advance the very important work that they have before them as well. \xc2\xa0I think that it\'s clear that even when talking about an issue like climate change that everybody acknowledges that Congress has a role in that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Finally, since we\'re talking about climate change, is there any comment or reaction to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s decision yesterday to break her silence and say that she is opposed to the Keystone pipeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not sure that there were many people, at least in this room, that any of you or any of us was particularly surprised by her comments or her position. \xc2\xa0We have said for some time essentially that Secretary Clinton and others who decide to run for President will have an opportunity to talk about their values and their priorities and their positions on a range of issues. \xc2\xa0But the responsibility of those who are in government is different. \xc2\xa0And in this case, the State Department continues to consider this specific policy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is consistent with the way that other infrastructure projects like this are considered. \xc2\xa0The consideration of this particular project has obviously lasted longer than the typical review that\xe2\x80\x99s conducted, but there are a variety of factors that are influencing the length of that review, including the fact that there are a number of legal proceedings that have extended the consideration of that project.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for a timeframe, in terms of when we would expect that review to be completed, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, are you able to give any details about their conversation? \xc2\xa0Specifically, can you say whether or not some of the hot-button social issues that we know they disagree on, like abortion and gay marriage, came up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to give additional details, Jeff. The reason that the two men wanted to meet just the two of them in the Oval Office was it was an opportunity for them to have a private discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the interpreter there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding is that the interpreter was not -- there was an interpreter there? \xc2\xa0Okay, so there was an interpreter there, but it was only the two of them talking.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So no suggestion on whether some of the less agreeable topics beyond climate change were part of their discussion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, even though an interpreter was present, the intention is for that conversation to remain private.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It seemed like they took a little longer to come down to the Colonnade and the Oval Office than -- at least on the time schedule. \xc2\xa0Did they linger upstairs? \xc2\xa0Did they hang out with the family a little bit? \xc2\xa0Can you tell us a little bit about what happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding is that\xe2\x80\x99s the time during which some Catholic members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior staff did have an opportunity to meet the Pope. \xc2\xa0It also was an opportunity for the President to meet the visiting delegation from the Vatican as well. \xc2\xa0And so this is typical of these kinds of formal visits.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Moving on to a different topic then. \xc2\xa0OPM released some additional information today about that breach. \xc2\xa0The White House has still not identified China as the official state sponsor of that. \xc2\xa0Will that happen before the visit? \xc2\xa0And can you give us some details on why that was released in the middle of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit while the President was outside speaking today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0Let me say a couple things about this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional details about who or what entity may have been responsible for this particular cyber breach. \xc2\xa0This is something that continues to be under investigation by authorities. \xc2\xa0There are some reports about what those authorities have learned as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been conducting this investigation over the last several months, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conclusions to share publicly about who may or may not have been responsible. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe timeframe for this announcement is that there was a previously scheduled meeting between senior leaders at OPM and relevant members of Congress with whom OPM has been working throughout this incident. \xc2\xa0And this additional information about the scope of the intrusion and the amount of material that was affected by the intrusion was only recently determined and so this new information was communicated to relevant members of Congress just days after it was learned. \xc2\xa0And once that information was communicated to Congress, it was also communicated to the public. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is an effort that is being made by the administration and certainly by the leadership at OPM to communicate as promptly and as effectively as possibly -- certainly with members of Congress that have an oversight responsibility, but also with those individuals who may have been affected by the breach. \xc2\xa0And because of the numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here, that information that is communicated is something that we can probably best do publicly. \xc2\xa0And so that would explain today\xe2\x80\x99s timing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you felt like that was an effective time to release it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it was the time that was sort of dictated by the kinds of priorities that we have laid out for communicating with Congress, communicating with those who potentially may have been affected in communicating with the public.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the White House have any idea whatsoever of what the Pope was going to say out on the South Lawn?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There obviously were a significant number of staff-level conversations to plan for the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for all of those conversations so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much of a preview of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s remarks was offered to White House officials. \xc2\xa0Some of your colleagues in the news media did inform me that the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s remarks were released early on an embargoed basis. \xc2\xa0So to the extent that you guys may have had a heads-up on what the Pope was planning to say, it sounds like you got that. \xc2\xa0But as far as --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You got a heads-up, too, at least when we did.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that you had a more detailed one than anybody here would have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what do you make of the fact -- I mean, it was almost as if this was a campaign event and you had two running mates with very similar speeches that were given. \xc2\xa0And I suppose you might say that that\xe2\x80\x99s a little over the top, but their messages were awfully similar. \xc2\xa0What did you make of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting perspective. \xc2\xa0I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t quite thought about it that way. \xc2\xa0I think what I made of the reception -- I guess, I think the one thing, Jim, that might detract from your analogy is I do think that there was a genuine spirit of inclusiveness and bipartisanship on display on the South Lawn today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI happened to be seated in the section where many members of Congress sat for the event. \xc2\xa0And no one would accuse me of being an expert with the congressional Facebook, but I certainly did recognize both Democrats and Republicans sitting on the South Lawn, and offering a warm welcome to the President and First Lady when they arrived on the South Lawn, but also offering an enthusiastic welcome when Pope Francis arrived as well. \xc2\xa0And that spirit of inclusion and bipartisanship is certainly I think something that the President appreciated. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for the Pope; I suspect that he was pleased by that kind of spirit as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason that I raise it is I think sometimes the connotation of a political event is that it might be a little polarizing or partisan, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that at all was the spirit that was on display on the South Lawn, either by the thousands who were in the audience or by the two men who spoke.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You had to be pleased that the President and the Pope delivered very similar messages on immigration -- the Pope would come out and say he\xe2\x80\x99s the son of an immigration family, to refer to the planet as our world, our \xe2\x80\x9ccommon home,\xe2\x80\x9d in his remarks on climate change. \xc2\xa0It was just about everything you could have hoped for, I would think. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think the credit for that goes to the Pope, though, right -- that the Pope made I think a concerted effort to speak inclusively. \xc2\xa0And I think that style of communication and that perspective on the world, of appealing to the common interests and common values of both Catholic and non-Catholics like, is one of the reasons that the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s message has resonated so deeply with people not just across this country, but around the world. \xc2\xa0And I guess that would be one element of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s message that was not surprising to those who would have listened to him speak over the last year and a half or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on China, very quickly. \xc2\xa0The President has not cited China as being responsible for the OPM hack in the same way that he went after North Korea on the Sony hack. \xc2\xa0And Ben Rhodes, on the conference call yesterday evening, said that there would not be sanctions issued on any entities prior to President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0What do you say to Americans who wonder if that is enough in terms of assigning culpability for what happened at OPM, which put millions of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 personal data at risk?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I would say is that the administration, and certainly our law enforcement officials, take very seriously the responsibility that they have to thoroughly investigate exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happened and to use that investigation to determine the precise scope of what information has been taken to learn exactly how that breach was conducted so that we can better strengthen our cyber defenses and, frankly, learn from any mistakes that may have exacerbated the consequences of the breach. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it does sort of raise questions about our broader concerns about malicious actors in cyberspace regardless of where they originate. \xc2\xa0And this is a significant challenge that the private sector has had to confront, but there have been a number of incidents that state and federal government computer networks have had to deal with as well. \xc2\xa0And those longer-term considerations are the ones that drive decisions about things like when and how to assign public blame and there is, I think, an understandable human tendency to offer a quick and powerful response. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on preserving the long-term interests of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing that I can say is that there are a variety of tools at the President\xe2\x80\x99s disposal for responding to incidents like this. \xc2\xa0One of them is a relatively new one. \xc2\xa0This is the executive order that the President signed about six months ago delegating authority to the Secretary of Treasury to allow him to impose financial sanctions against bad actors in cyberspace or those who benefit from that malicious activity.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one of the reasons that that tool is powerful is that merely putting it on the table can serve as a deterrent and can serve to advance the interests of the United States -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not specifically invoked, so I guess what you might call a longer-term strategic approach to confronting these issues and both trying to protect our interests but also, where appropriate, seeking to advance them.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The Clinton campaign says they briefed the White House before Secretary Clinton came out and opposed Keystone yesterday. \xc2\xa0Can you characterize those briefings? \xc2\xa0Who was briefed? \xc2\xa0How high up did those briefings go? \xc2\xa0How was the President informed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think I would characterize them as a briefing. \xc2\xa0As I think you would expect, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for there to be some informal conversations. \xc2\xa0Again, I don\'t know how detailed any of those conversations were. \xc2\xa0But even if there were no conversations that had occurred, I don\'t think there was any expectation that it was incumbent upon the Clinton campaign to give us a heads-up about this or any other announcement that they\'re making. \xc2\xa0And again, even if no conversations had occurred, I don\'t think anybody would have been particularly surprised at the position that Secretary Clinton announced yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I know there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing State Department review. Do you have a sense of when there might be a final determination? You have all of these presidential candidates who are obviously going to be taking over the reins at some point coming out and weighing in on this. \xc2\xa0Do you have a timeline, a deadline?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t anticipate that any of those comments will have an impact on the final decision. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t have an update on the timeframe. \xc2\xa0The State Department may have one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you about the government shutdown. \xc2\xa0A group of 11 House Republican freshmen sent a letter to their colleagues urging them to avert the shutdown. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sounds like good news. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d say that. \xc2\xa0But at this point, what is your level of optimism, realistically speaking -- because the situation still seems to be somewhat deadlocked -- that a shutdown will be averted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m a little more optimistic now than when you started the question because I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of the letter. \xc2\xa0The reason I think that that is good news is that there should be bipartisan acknowledgement that a government shutdown is not in the best interests of the country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not in the best interests of our economy. \xc2\xa0And while these issues are difficult, it is the fundamental responsibility of the United States Congress to pass a budget every year for the federal government and ensure that the government doesn\'t shut down.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is important, however, beyond just keeping the government open is also making sure that that budget accurately reflects the national security and economic priorities of the country. \xc2\xa0So that will also be an important responsibility of the\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCongress. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t know if that was mentioned in their letter, as well, but ultimately, we do know how this can get resolved. \xc2\xa0And that\'s with Republicans in Congress accepting the invitation that they have received from Democrats in Congress to sit down at the negotiating table and work this out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I know you\'re putting this on Congress, but how does the President see his role? \xc2\xa0He obviously has a very busy week, and then he goes to UNGA. \xc2\xa0And I know you got a similar question yesterday, but I guess I want to follow up on that. \xc2\xa0What specifically can we expect to see from him in the coming days in terms of engagement on this issues and trying to make sure that there is no shutdown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, I don\'t have any specific conversations to tell you about at the presidential level. \xc2\xa0Certainly senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team including the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget will not be leaving town. \xc2\xa0They will be in town and available if congressional negotiators need to draw upon their expertise in order to reach an agreement and prevent a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of the support that needs to be provided by the administration will be in place, but ultimately the final decision rests with Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And have there been any meetings about what happens if it does shut down, any contingency plans? \xc2\xa0I understand there may have been some discussions about potential furloughs. \xc2\xa0Can you update us on that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is a process that we, unfortunately, are becoming all too familiar with by which the government prepares for the possibility of a government shutdown. And we\'re in the range of seven or eight days now before the deadline. \xc2\xa0And it is only prudent for the federal government to begin planning for the possibility that the government could shut down.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so at this point, they\'re only in the planning stage. \xc2\xa0And it means making sure that agencies are aware of their responsibilities in the event of a government shutdown and there have been some communications from the Office of Management and Budget to federal agencies about this. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, these kinds of notifications, unfortunately, are becoming routine, so it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any immediate or short-term impact on the functioning of the federal government or on the day-to-day responsibilities of the vast majority of the federal workforce. \xc2\xa0But there are some members of the administration, including those who serve in senior positions, who, for example, have to take time out of their day to -- away from the many tasks that they have before them to get on a conference call with the Office of Management and Budget to start talking about a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that is an indication of at least one price that is paid by budgetary brinksmanship on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the sooner that Republicans will sit down with Democrats to work out a solution, the better.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One final one on the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s comments about climate change. \xc2\xa0Does the President think that his comments today could help shape the conversations in Paris during that climate summit? And does he hope that they might?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think as I mentioned earlier, I think the Pope was keenly aware that the comments that he would deliver today would be closely watched not just by those of us on the South Lawn but by people around the world. \xc2\xa0And he is a man of extraordinary influence and I would expect that his call to action would be heard around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat eventual impact that has at the negotiating table or in the minds of policymakers remains to be seen. \xc2\xa0But certainly it was a powerful statement and one that I think that people around the world will take seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a little bit more. \xc2\xa0I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the content of their meeting, but what are the President\xe2\x80\x99s observations of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit? \xc2\xa0Was he surprised by anything that the Pope said in his speech? \xc2\xa0Was he perhaps inspired by the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cuba to make his own trip to Cuba? \xc2\xa0Did he first learn about what the Pope was going to say in real time, or had he specifically been given a heads-up about what was in his speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President was listening intently to the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s words and it\xe2\x80\x99s because he wanted to hear firsthand what the Pope had on his heart this morning. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That was the first time he had --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, that was the first time that -- he had not -- again, unlike many of you, the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the opportunity to read the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s prepared remarks. \xc2\xa0And so it was the first chance that the President had to hear from the Pope. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for some time now that people at the White House and people all across the city have been excited about and eagerly anticipating the visit of Pope Francis. \xc2\xa0And the President and the First Family shared in that excitement, and I think that was evident when the President and his family met the Pope at the stairs of his aircraft at Joint Base Andrews yesterday. \xc2\xa0You may have seen the White House video that we put out this morning that showed the President\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic welcome of the Pope when he reached the bottom of the stairs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has a deep admiration for the Pope. \xc2\xa0They had an opportunity to visit when the President visited the Vatican last year, and it was a memorable meeting and the President came away quite impressed. \xc2\xa0And the President really enjoyed the opportunity to visit with him again today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there anything particular in the speech that surprised him or that he was reflective on, either to you or to other members of his staff? \xc2\xa0And can you answer the Cuba question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear him characterize anything as surprising, but I think the President, like many of us, noted the conviction with which the Pope spoke. \xc2\xa0The Pope was focused I think on his own deep moral conviction about a range of issues. \xc2\xa0And he spoke freely and from the heart and, impressively, not in his first language.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that I think that struck a chord is his focus on \xe2\x80\x9cthe least of these\xe2\x80\x9d who are most immediately and directly impacted by climate change. \xc2\xa0And for all of the reasons that we talk about in here about why the President has made this a priority, both sort of a moral responsibility we have to future generations and the potential economic opportunity that exists in this country for investments in things like renewable energy -- one thing I think that does get overlooked is the fact that it is poor communities around the world that are most likely to be directly affected by the impacts of climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President had the opportunity to observe this when he traveled to Alaska a few weeks ago. \xc2\xa0On the way to the Arctic Circle, Air Force One flew over this village, Kivalina, that\xe2\x80\x99s on a barrier island in Alaska, whose land is slowly but surely receding into the sea. \xc2\xa0This is a community without a lot of economic resources and is fairly isolated, and is literally at risk because of rising sea levels.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo hearing the President speak -- or hearing the Pope speak with conviction about action on climate change because of the impact it would have on those who face the biggest economic disadvantage I think is just another reason to hear the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s call to action on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Cuba, the President obviously had his own kind words for the Pope and the role that he played in helping to facilitate the agreement to normalize relations between our two countries. \xc2\xa0And obviously the Pope himself sort of talked about the importance of reconciliation. \xc2\xa0But I think the President -- well, I know the President has had a desire to travel to Cuba even before Pope Francis made the decision to travel to the island, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that we saw about the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit that in any way diminishes the President\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm for that possibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One other thing. \xc2\xa0Did you guys interpret what the Pope said about diplomacy as an endorsement of the President\xe2\x80\x99s outreach to Iran and the nuclear deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do believe that the Vatican has spoken positively about the international agreement with Iran in the past. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t, frankly, know whether or not that passage in the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s remarks was intended to allude to that or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First I wanted to ask about Russia. \xc2\xa0Their state media is reporting that there is a meeting for next week with President Obama and President Putin. \xc2\xa0The Kremlin is indicating that something is going on, but that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been finalized -- so I\'m just wondering if you can shed any light on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any lockdown details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in New York to share today, but I would anticipate that tomorrow we\'ll have more details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip. \xc2\xa0So I\'ll have an update for you then.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have there been discussions with the Russians about the possibility of a meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have much to say about any possible discussions with the Russians on this particular topic. Obviously President Putin is planning to travel to New York, and part of the time that he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York President Obama will also be there, too. \xc2\xa0But at this point, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait until tomorrow to see exactly what the final schedule is going to look like.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was also some reporting that the Pope planned to raise Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt situation with the President while he\xe2\x80\x99s here. \xc2\xa0That could have happened either at the leader-to-leader level or through staff. \xc2\xa0And I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t read out the meeting that they were in privately, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that any of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s staff at a certain point discussed over the last few days.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0I have not gotten a detailed readout of the other meetings that occurred here at the White House, so we may have to follow up with you on that. \xc2\xa0If we can get you some more information on that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, the UK\xe2\x80\x99s Chancellor Osborne has spent the last five days in China and really been effusive in his praise for the Chinese, but also talking about linking their economies more closely together. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting trip kind of against the backdrop of obviously the Chinese President\xe2\x80\x99s visit here and some of the things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been pressuring them on, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity or the South China Sea or the American businesswoman that\xe2\x80\x99s been detained. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk at all about if you see rhetoric coming from the UK, which has said they want to be China\xe2\x80\x99s strongest partner in the West, at all detrimental to some of the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to pressure China on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, I did spend a decent amount of time preparing for the briefing today on a range of priorities, but this particular issue didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in any detail. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware precisely of what the individual that you referred to may have said. \xc2\xa0So that may give you an indication of how concerned we are about any of the positions that he may have taken over the course of this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to ask you a couple questions about the Pope. \xc2\xa0Since the President likes to take world leaders to the King memorial, and the Pope did invoke Dr. King in his speech, did the President at all talk about Dr. King, or at least show him the statue that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Oval Office that he sat right in front of?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as you point out, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to miss. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of whether or not they had a discussion of Dr. King in their meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, on that statement, that was a drop-the-mic moment for the Pope. \xc2\xa0It was. \xc2\xa0A very strong statement. \xc2\xa0Normally we hear many of the quotes that are in Dr. King, they\xe2\x80\x99re used over and over again. \xc2\xa0But to hear the Pope say that we defaulted on the promissory, that\xe2\x80\x99s very strong. \xc2\xa0And including the President\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual advisor said how strong that was. \xc2\xa0That means that there needs to be some kind of paycheck that\xe2\x80\x99s dealt with that, that\xe2\x80\x99s compensated for when it comes to immigration and climate change. \xc2\xa0Do you think that this President believesthe Pope\xe2\x80\x99s statement out there about the promise of not defaulting on the promissory note when it comes to issue of immigration, specifically when you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we had the right momentum last week to push immigration through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, I saw the context of Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s quote that was recited by the Pope in the context of climate change. \xc2\xa0It may be that the Pope intended that to apply to other areas as well; certainly it could. \xc2\xa0But I think time will tell what sort of impact the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy on these issues will have both in the United States and around the world. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t predict at this point exactly what impact it will have in the policymaking process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s say then -- according to other people -- because he heard the audible gasp when he made statement, the defaulting on a promissory note. \xc2\xa0And with that, people were -- he brought their attention to the issue. \xc2\xa0But even with that on, as you say, climate change, do you think that you can kind of rally some of the Republican Party on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have made clear that we would welcome the support of Republicans for the effort to cut carbon pollution and fight the other causes of climate change. \xc2\xa0We know that taking those kinds of steps are clearly in the best interest of the planet, they\xe2\x80\x99re in the best interest of the next generation of Americans, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also in the clear interest of this generation of Americans when it comes to a range of public health issues. \xc2\xa0So we certainly are hopeful that Republicans will work constructively with Democrats on some of these issues, but that remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, going back to the speech, did you know that he was going to use that quote specifically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did not.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, just one small thing on the ceremony. \xc2\xa0Typically the state ceremonies have a 21-gun salute. \xc2\xa0In fact, there was one for Benedict when he came in 2008. \xc2\xa0But you all, I assume, opted not it. \xc2\xa0Can you describe why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think this -- obviously we had a discussion that was closely coordinated with the Pentagon -- with the Vatican. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I suppose when as it comes to particular question, the Pentagon may have been involved too. \xc2\xa0But when planning events like that, the White House closely coordinates the activities with, in this case, the Vatican. \xc2\xa0And obviously this Pope has a reputation of somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t revel in the pomp and circumstance as much as some other world leaders do. \xc2\xa0And so it was in deference to his humility that a 21-gun salute was not included in the formal arrival ceremony today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was it about his humility or about the idea of a militaristic display? \xc2\xa0I mean, there were still military and obviously color guards and so forth on the South Lawn.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, certainly his humility factored into that decision. \xc2\xa0But yes, it also -- I think some might also recognize the dissonance in welcoming a professed man of peace to the White House through the repeated firing of weapons. \xc2\xa0I think that we felt like I think what would be described as a slightly more subdued welcome ceremony was the most appropriate way to welcome Pope Francis to the White House. \xc2\xa0And based solely on his public reaction to the festivities, it appears that Pope Francis agreed with that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up on Peter? \xc2\xa0Will there be a 21-gun salute on Friday when President Xi comes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I assume so. \xc2\xa0There typically is. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check on that and let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A different concept.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct. \xc2\xa0Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Pope, the President certainly made clear that he was not content with the situation in Iran with the hostages remaining there. \xc2\xa0And because of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s success in bringing together Cuba and the United States, is the United States asking the Pope in any way to intervene in the case of the hostages in Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start with an observation, which is that the island nation of Cuba has a large number of Catholics. \xc2\xa0There are obviously many fewer Catholics in Iran. \xc2\xa0That said, the Pope is clearly somebody with significant moral influence, even among those who are not Catholic. \xc2\xa0What I will say is simply that the President has made clear that our efforts to try to secure the safe return of those Americans that are unjustly held inside of Iran, those efforts continue. \xc2\xa0And they continue to be a priority of this administration and of the President personally. \xc2\xa0And we have pursued a variety of avenues for trying to secure the release of those individuals, but we have found that it is -- that our efforts are more effective when we don\'t talk about them publicly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\'re not ruling it out. \xc2\xa0You just -- this is something you don\'t want to speak about publicly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I don\'t have an update at this point on our ongoing efforts to secure the release of those Americans that are being unjustly held inside of Iran other than to confirm for you that those efforts are ongoing and continue to be a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Keystone pipeline, understanding your statements in the past that you\'re not going to say whether it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s baby -- but on the statement by Hillary Clinton, was there anything that the White House disagrees with when she says that approving the Keystone pipeline would, in fact, set us in the wrong direction as far as energy independence, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to provide a lot of jobs? \xc2\xa0Is there anything -- does the White House disagree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has spoken on this issue a couple of times where he has indicated his skepticism about some of the claims made by the most ardent supporters of the Keystone pipeline. \xc2\xa0We have seen some rather dubious claims about the number of jobs that would be created through the construction of the pipeline; and of the long-term economic impact of the project or those jobs that are created. \xc2\xa0The President said that himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I have not looked carefully. \xc2\xa0I understand that Secretary Clinton did write an op-ed for Medium today. \xc2\xa0I did not have an opportunity to take a close look at that before I walked out here. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t know that I can say that we agreed necessarily with everything that she included in her statement. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that has been widely reported that I would strenuously disagree with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then finally on the issue of drug prices, does the White House and this President regret that part of its actions to approve Obamacare led to a situation with -- that prohibits Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug companies, which, in fact, would save billions of dollars and, according to private insurance companies, would help them use the weight of Medicare to bring down drug prices today? \xc2\xa0Does the President regret his agreement to prohibit drug companies -- Medicare from negotiating with drug companies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal was when it came to trying to pass the Affordable Care Act -- well, there were several goals, actually. \xc2\xa0The first was trying to expand quality, affordable health care to every American to ensure that access to quality health care is no longer a privilege but is actually a basic right. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that would be part of accomplishing that goal is trying to slow what had previously been the almost unrestrained growth in health care costs in this country. \xc2\xa0That was having a negative impact on our economy. \xc2\xa0It certainly was having a negative impact on some businesses that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to afford quality health insurance for their employees. \xc2\xa0And it surely was having a negative impact on middle-class families across the country who were straining under the weight of those skyrocketing health care costs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, we have actually seen the slowest growth in health care costs in recorded history. \xc2\xa0And at least part of that is attributable to the policies that are put in place through the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0The President -- so this goal of trying to contain costs for businesses and middle-class families is one that has been one part of the important benefits that are included in the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear that there are likely opportunities to further strengthen the Affordable Care Act in ways that would expand access even further and could even further restrain growth in health care costs. \xc2\xa0And the President has indicated a willingness to work with Democrats and Republicans to try to strengthen the Affordable Care Act in pursuit of those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans in Congress be so focused on trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and undermine this important law that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to make much progress in that regard. \xc2\xa0But we continue to be open to it today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You still didn\xe2\x80\x99t give the answer to that particular question. \xc2\xa0Does the -- I understand why it got there and why you\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to do it. \xc2\xa0But now drug prices are out of control, many people would say, especially in some very critical drugs. \xc2\xa0Is the President bothered by the fact that he allowed Medicare Part D, which prohibits Medicare from negotiating down these prices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Jim, what is clear is there were concerns about the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs prior to the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And it is true that many of those challenges for our health care system have not been addressed. \xc2\xa0But some of the other areas where the growth in costs was particularly significant were addressed by the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that we have made important progress in some areas that have significantly expanded access to health care for -- there are now 17 million more Americans that have health care today than before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. \xc2\xa0And we know that according to this complicated economic measurement that actually the growth in health care costs is as slow as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of important progress in accomplishing our goals through the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And I think the President would be the first to admit that if there are opportunities for us to make additional progress, he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to work in bipartisan fashion to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there a mutual discussion of the speeches that each -- the principals would give today? \xc2\xa0Did they discuss beforehand what the Pope would say here and what the President would say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Other than sort of logistical questions about the length and the language in which the speech would be delivered, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any intensive coordination when it came to the content of the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, for example, the White House wasn\xe2\x80\x99t encouraging the Pope to lead with immigration, as it were?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0Surely, the Pope would certainly decide for himself how he would begin and end his speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And talk about abortion and religious freedom in his speech to the bishops --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, these are decisions made entirely by the Pope and his team.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to follow up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been so much talk lately about prescription drugs, -- been in the news lately. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has heard about the skyrocketing cost going from 13 bucks to $750 for a pill for that particular drug and if he feels like this is just smart business or if it\xe2\x80\x99s unabashed avarice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, considering that the company themselves have quickly made the decision to roll back that cost, it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that the company concluded it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good business decision. \xc2\xa0And obviously when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an individual company\xe2\x80\x99s decision, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to comment on from here. \xc2\xa0But obviously if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about expanding access to health care for more people and lowering health care costs for businesses and middle-class families, the enormous price increase of a particular and important medication is inconsistent with those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple of follows also. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the Keystone pipeline. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve often punted over to State. \xc2\xa0Does the President care if it is wrapped up before he leaves office? \xc2\xa0It just seems like this is kind of a shrug of the shoulders, hey, if they get to it, they get to it; if not, eh, it\xe2\x80\x99s they\xe2\x80\x99re baby. \xc2\xa0Is that a misread of his position on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President has previously stated that he would expect that this policy decision would be made and implemented before the end of his presidency, either way. \xc2\xa0So there is an expectation that this work will be done and this review will be completed. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t know exactly when, between now and January 2017 that will occur.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you prefer it be January, say, 17th or 18th of 2017? \xc2\xa0It just seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s no urgency here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think that\'s entirely accurate. Obviously there has been a lot of important work that\'s gone into reviewing this particular project and I think the President would be prepared to make a decision just as soon as a recommendation is ready to be acted upon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple more. \xc2\xa0VW\xe2\x80\x99s leader steps down. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to that decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any specific reaction to the decision of that company\xe2\x80\x99s leader to step down. \xc2\xa0The fact is this administration, particularly the EPA, takes very seriously the responsibilities that they have to regulate these companies. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s an expectation that when those companies are communicating with regulators, but more importantly, communicating with their customers that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be honest about it. \xc2\xa0And obviously this particular company has acknowledged that they weren\'t. \xc2\xa0But for how accountability is brought with respect to that admission, that\'s obviously a decision for that company to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Update on Ex-I\'m at all --the Ex-Im Bank?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have an update on that. \xc2\xa0I know that that\'s something that the administration continues to support and there is bipartisan support for it on the Hill. \xc2\xa0We just need to get Congress to act on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Yogi Berra passes away, a real great. \xc2\xa0Your thoughts on the passing of a baseball legend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we put out a statement from the President a little earlier today on this. \xc2\xa0Yogi Berra was obviously a cultural icon both for his athletic prowess but also because I think a lot of people all across the country felt like they could relate to him. \xc2\xa0And I think that kind of humility embodied in somebody with such great athletic skills made him a notable character.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe obviously was pretty colorful as well, and obviously, as I mentioned, he\xe2\x80\x99s an American icon and we certainly are saddened to learn of his passing today.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharlie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m curious about the comments the President made about religious liberty, religious freedom. \xc2\xa0The response of a lot of his critics suggested that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t committed to religious liberty and religious freedom in America, citing the federal lawsuit against the Little Sisters of the Poor, other incidences in America, the government persecuting Christians for their beliefs on same-sex marriage. \xc2\xa0And I wondered if you had a response to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the simple response is I would encourage you to take the President at his word. \xc2\xa0He spoke powerfully and with conviction about his commitment to religious liberty. \xc2\xa0As somebody who is both a Christian and someone who has ordered the United States military to take aggressive action to protect the safety and well-being of religious minorities, including Christians, around the globe, I think it\'s pretty clear from his actions and his words that this is a value that he holds quite dear. \xc2\xa0It certainly is a value that is central to the founding of this country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the President of the United States and as somebody who feels strongly about the values of this country, he works hard every day to uphold them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As far as domestic issues and certain modern American news and politics, what\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, you cited one specific court case, and most of the federal judges who have taken a look at that case have actually found that the efforts of the administration to protect the religious liberty of that particular organization were successful. \xc2\xa0And again, I think that\'s actually a good example of this administration working closely with religious leaders and those with a variety of religious views to ensure that we are implementing policies that benefit the American people and maximize the benefit to the American people while also protecting the religious liberties of our citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a couple -- on the time that you gave us, was that the Oval Office time, or are you counting the Colonnade and all the rest of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That 40 minutes or so is the time that they spent together in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you speak to the President after the Oval Office meeting? \xc2\xa0Did he say, Josh, we\'re just going to keep this between the two of us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did not speak to him directly after the meeting, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But how do you know that he wants it private?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That was the plan going into the meeting. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0By mutual agreement between the White House and the Vatican that neither side would do a readout?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- what happened when we got a readout the last time around where it was substantially different?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of. \xc2\xa0I think it was rooted in the desire of both men to have a private conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple questions on the Pope. \xc2\xa0The factsheet that the White House sent out afterward listed a number of initiatives that the administration was pursuing to mark the historic meeting. \xc2\xa0One of them was the expansion in the number of refugees that the U.S. would seek to admit. \xc2\xa0Should we understand that that decision was made directly because of Pope Francis\xe2\x80\x99s urging of such a move, or was this just inspired by him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, you should interpret that those policy announcements were made in response to the significant tide of migrants that has expanded beyond the Middle East, and the urgent humanitarian situation that exists in some places in Europe but mostly in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0And the United States has been playing a leading role in responding to this crisis for a number of years now, and the recent announcements about scaling up our response in terms of the number of refugees that will be admitted to the United States and the amount of money that will go to this ongoing humanitarian effort I think is an indication that the President intends to continue to lead the world\xe2\x80\x99s response to this humanitarian crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\'s included in the factsheet because the expectation was that at some point over the six days of his visit to the United States the Pope would talk about the moral responsibility that leaders around the world, including in the United States, have to respond to this situation. \xc2\xa0And we felt it was relevant for everyone to know what steps the United States had taken as we play a leading role in this response.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then the events this morning on the South Lawn began a little bit late. \xc2\xa0And I think our understanding was that was in part because Pope Francis left the Vatican Embassy a little bit late, greeting some people there. \xc2\xa0Can you recall a time when the President was kept waiting for such an event like this? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not off the top of my head, but it has not significantly inconvenienced the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule at all today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then quickly, since a great Yankee was asked about earlier by one of my colleagues, there was a petition drive to aware Yogi Berra the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \xc2\xa0Is that something that might be under consideration now posthumously?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I was not aware of that ongoing effort. \xc2\xa0But my guess is if that\'s something that were considered, it\xe2\x80\x99s something we probably would not announce in advance.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A sad story which is happening at this moment all over the world, especially in Europe -- Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, a young Shiite -- 21 years old, is going to be probably beheaded tomorrow and his body crucified inside Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0Human rights organizations, European media, and millions of people on Twitter are asking for an international mobilization against the Saudis. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the intimate details of this particular situation, Laura. \xc2\xa0But I will say that the United States, under the leadership of this President, regularly raises our concerns about the human rights situation inside of Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know the President has on more than one occasion had the opportunity to raise these concerns directly with his counterpart when he\xe2\x80\x99s met with the Saudi leader. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitant to comment much further on this case because I don\'t know a whole lot of the details. \xc2\xa0But the principle when it comes to human rights is one that this President has championed, and one that this President has raised directly with Saudi officials on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, earlier you said that the comments from Hillary Clinton yesterday on Keystone came as no surprise. \xc2\xa0My question is: \xc2\xa0Given her tenure at the State Department, is it -- and you were citing the long, drawn-out time that this has stayed in consideration at the State Department, is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that now that we know her position on Keystone XL publicly that perhaps she tilted it at State while she was the Secretary of State toward this direction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any indication of that. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a process underway at the State Department, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to consider that process once they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a recommendation to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just to clean up a little bit on the question about the 21-gun salute. \xc2\xa0You said it was in deference to several aspects of the papal character. \xc2\xa0But I guess, who shot first? \xc2\xa0Who asked for it? \xc2\xa0Was it the Vatican asking for this directly, or was this the White House offering it to the Vatican?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m actually not sure who -- whether it was an ask or an offer, but it certainly was a decision that was reached in consultation with Vatican officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoyal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you very much. \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0One, yesterday there was a strategic and commercial development between the U.S. and India -- and as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned, and also Prime Minister Modi at Silicon Valley also talking about the U.S.-India relations. \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) at the highest level, including Vice President, spoke to the delegation at the State Department. \xc2\xa0So what did the presidential message of this future of U.S.-India relations? \xc2\xa0This is the first time that in the steady dialogue between the two countries, largest and oldest democracies, commercial was also added.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Goyal, when the President traveled to India earlier this year, there was much discussion of the important economic ties between our two countries. \xc2\xa0In fact, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that there were American business leaders who traveled to India at the same time as the President to engage in discussions with Indian business leaders and leaders in the Indian government to discuss strengthening the ties between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe idea here is that by strengthening these ties, we can expand economic opportunity in both of our countries; that the more business that American businesses can do in India, the more economic opportunity that it creates back here in the United States. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also a potential that Indian businesses choosing to invest in the United States could also expand some economic opportunity here as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are any number of reasons why the President would work closely with his counterpart, Prime Minister Modi, who I know understands these kinds of dynamics and shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of trying to deepen these ties with an eye toward expanding economic opportunity for the citizens in both the United States and India.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Second, as far as celebrating the 70th anniversary of the United Nations next week of course, most of the global leaders, including President Obama and Prime Minister Modi, will be at the United Nations. \xc2\xa0After 68 years of India\xe2\x80\x99s independence, the people of India are asking, and now the Indian Americans also in the U.S. asking the United States that if U.S. is going to support. \xc2\xa0Why the national language of India, Hindi, and India\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the United Nations Security Council is not there? \xc2\xa0Why Hindi, and India is not in the U.N. Security Council. \xc2\xa0Will the U.S. support this year to celebrate the 70th anniversary? \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re asking really, that message to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Goyal, my understanding is the President has previously stated that the United States would be supportive of including India in the United Nations Security Council in the context of reforming essentially the governance structure of the United Nations. \xc2\xa0And I think that was something that the President announced on his trip to India, his first trip to India back in 2010. \xc2\xa0And that continues to be the position of the United States, and I think it reflects the increasingly important role that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing India play around the world. \xc2\xa0And as the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracy and as a country whose economic influence is only growing, we would welcome additional opportunities for India to take on additional responsibilities when it comes to contributing to the shared interests of the international community. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll look for a variety of ways to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tCertainly one way to do that would be for India to play a constructive role in the climate talks in Paris; that as a growing economy, India could make an important statement about the future of our planet by making a serious commitment in the context of those negotiations. \xc2\xa0And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s something that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi have had the opportunity to talk about in the past, and I would anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it again in advance of the Paris climate talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And finally, can you confirm if the two leaders at the U.N. will be meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule at the U.N. tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Following up on Kevin and Keystone, has the President never questioned what in the world is taking so long for the State Department to come to a conclusion on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there have been --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been years.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- extensive discussions about this. \xc2\xa0There have been a number of things that have slowed the consideration of this particular project; one of them is that there was an ongoing court case in Nebraska about the particular route of the pipeline. \xc2\xa0But this is something that the President is regularly updated on, but in terms of the timing of when a decision would be announced, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And would you take issue with an assertion that the President is happy to let the State Department take its time coming to a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President would have the expectation that the State Department would fulfill the responsibility that they have to carefully consider the consequences of this particular project and the potential benefits of the project, and evaluate whether or not it is in the broad national interest of the United States for the project to go forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You only gave Congress 60 days to talk -- to decide about Iran and the nuclear deal -- (laughter) -- but the State Department is taking years on this project.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the difference is the State Department has a responsibility to specifically sign off on the project, and that is what\xe2\x80\x99s described in the law. \xc2\xa0Congress, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, based on the law that they wrote and they passed themselves, did not have the responsibility to sign off on the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0They were, however, given the 60-day window of opportunity to undermine the deal if they chose to do so; fortunately, they did not.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t2:35 P.M.
