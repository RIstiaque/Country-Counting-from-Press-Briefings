EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have a brief statement from the President on the attacks in Mumbai today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "I strongly condemn the outrageous attacks in Mumbai.\xc2\xa0 And my thoughts and prayers are with the wounded and those who have lost loved ones.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. government continues to monitor the situation, including the safety and security of our citizens.\xc2\xa0 India is a close friend and partner of the United States.\xc2\xa0 The American people will stand with the Indian people in times of trial and we will offer support to India\'s efforts to bring the perpetrators of these terrible crimes to justice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "During my trip to Mumbai, I saw firsthand the strength and resilience of the Indian people, and I have no doubt that India will overcome these deplorable terrorist acts."<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, the President this morning placed a call and spoke briefly with President Karzai and expressed his condolences on the loss of his half-brother.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\'ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow quickly on the Mumbai attacks, does the U.S. have any indication of what terrorist group may have been behind the attacks or claims of responsibility at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s obviously quite early and so I don\'t have any information on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, to move toward the deficit talks, since the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t outright rejected Senator McConnell\'s backup plan, can you give us a sense of how seriously the administration is taking it in terms of whether the counsel\'s office is reviewing it or if OMB is taking a look -- anything that would put it on a path where if you had to turn to that backup plan it would be ready to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that the counsel\'s office is involved.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that OMB is looking at it.\xc2\xa0 What we said yesterday and what the President said is that we appreciate the fact that Senator McConnell\'s proposal is effectively an acknowledgment of what we have said all along that there is no alternative to the United States honoring its obligations; that we cannot play a game of chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States government, and therefore, there has to be some mechanism, no matter what happens, to make sure that Congress takes action to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not a preferred option.\xc2\xa0 The President is firmly committed to significant cuts in spending and to dealing with our deficit and debt problems in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 He has been saying every day in these negotiations, these talks with congressional leaders, and he will say again today, this afternoon when they meet, that as they essentially assemble the building blocks for a possible compromise in terms of cutting spending, reforming entitlements, potentially, and obviously finding savings in the tax code, that bigger is better; that this is a unique opportunity to accomplish something significant on behalf of the American people, to really -- it\'s an opportunity for a game changer, to put the United States on much firmer ground as we really get into the 21st century and the economic competition that confronts us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have said all along that we have to maintain the full faith and credit of the United States and that we will do that, and we have taken congressional leaders at their word that they intend to do that.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s plan, proposal, is an acknowledgment of that, that the linkage that has existed in the past is not viable because there is no alternative.\xc2\xa0 But it is not the preferred option.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how we get to the bigger deal that the President wants --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you get to them through negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how those negotiations end up in a bigger deal at this point.\xc2\xa0 Are we are a point in the process, though, where we should expect to see more backup plans come out? Do you have any indications from the Hill that there are other backup plans in the works?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let members of Congress speak for themselves in terms of proposals they might be working on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any, in terms of backup plans.\xc2\xa0 But the conversations, negotiations, deliberations that are underway, both in the meetings here in the White House and obviously in other meetings and conversations, are about trying to find -- to solve a real problem here, which is the need to get our deficits under control, to reduce spending, and to deal with our long-term debt issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is the focus of the conversations.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there is no alternative to raising the debt ceiling and to honoring our obligations, to paying our bills, essentially, bills that were run up in the past, is obviously one that we share.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s plan looks like the type of short-term incremental plan that the President came out earlier this week and said he would not support.\xc2\xa0 So if you have to go in this direction, is this a flip-flop on his position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we have said that we appreciate the recognition and acknowledgment that the proposal puts forward about the need to, under any circumstance, maintain the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0 We have not discussed or analyzed the components of the plan or endorsed it in its particulars, again, because this is a fall-back backup option, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the preferred option.\xc2\xa0 We believe the American people expect us to do something about reducing spending, getting our deficits and debts under control. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has made himself -- made it very clear that he is willing to compromise to do that, to take difficult steps, make difficult choices, take heat from his party as necessary to achieve something that the American people expect him to achieve and expect their leaders in Washington to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what I think the President made clear is that we are the United States of America; we should not be engaged in raising every six weeks, eight weeks, three months, six months a question about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet our obligations.\xc2\xa0 So that still is his position. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing all along from Secretary Geithner and from other administration officials that there was no plan B, no contingency plan if the debt ceiling was not raised by August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 But now we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from Fed Chairmen Bernanke in his testimony today that, in fact, they are prioritizing that the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Matt, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- payments on the government debt would be the first item.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we made clear is that there is no -- there is no plan B in that there\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of way to fix the fact that we would be in default.\xc2\xa0 The fact that you have to deal with the consequences of being in default and that you would have to make heinous choices about which bills you would pay and you have to prepare for that as a matter of due diligence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that that\xe2\x80\x99s a plan B for solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with the consequences of a catastrophic decision not to maintain the full faith and credit of the United States government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the administration is, in fact, preparing a contingency plan with specific priorities if this comes to pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a big government that -- and, again, the Fed is an independent organization.\xc2\xa0 But the point is not that there is some alternative to -- that we can make the problem of default go away through a plan.\xc2\xa0 There is no alternative.\xc2\xa0 You either honor your obligations or you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you make terrible choices about which ones -- which bills you will pay and which you won\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bernanke also added his voice to warnings that a default would be a huge crisis for the country.\xc2\xa0 It could lead to a downgrade of credit ratings, higher interest rates.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration see the potential for his voice being added to add pressure to the Republicans to give some ground in negotiations today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we -- that goes back to what I said before.\xc2\xa0 Leaders of Congress, including the Senate Minority Leader and the Speaker of the House and others, have said on numerous occasions that we have to honor our obligations and not go into default, and that there is -- paraphrasing here -- there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an alternative here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we welcome the vocal recognition of that from anyone who has a credible voice to remind people, because there are obviously -- moving from the leadership to rank-and-file members and others -- there are some who seem to believe that this is not a serious and consequential situation that could potentially make the recession that we went through in 2008 look minor by comparison, depending on the kind of consequences that could ensue after a default.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, let me step back.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen because we believe that this is the United States of America and the leaders of Congress, as well as the President, will do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to make sure that we fulfill our obligations and that we do not default for the first time in our history.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Cantor, the Majority Leader, is suggesting that President Obama should make the changes he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make to entitlement spending public, that the Republicans voted for the Paul Ryan plan, which is a very public way to get -- to express what they think should be done for Medicare, and that the suggestions he made, Cantor made, were released earlier this week, and that it would help Republicans understand what a deal would look like if the President publicly came forward with an explanation of what he wanted to do, what he was willing to do. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is there a question?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do you disagree -- do you disagree with that idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have made clear in the negotiations, in the conversations, what we are willing to do and the significant compromises the President is willing to make, the cuts he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to accept in discretionary spending, for example, as well as the reforms he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to consider in entitlement programs as part of a balanced package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that some people would want us to say we\xe2\x80\x99ll do all this and they say, great, let\xe2\x80\x99s just do that, and by the way, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a balanced package, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already agreed to these cuts and compromises and reforms -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not how negotiations should work.\xc2\xa0 We believe that in order to achieve balance, you need to sit around a table and work out a balanced package. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to Senator Dole but as many have said, that the way to do this is, everybody gets in the boat together at one time so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tip over.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to accept measures that won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be popular with all Democrats, and certainly we believe that it is the responsibility of Republicans to be leaders and to be willing to accept measures and compromises that won\xe2\x80\x99t be necessarily popular with all Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is a growing chorus out here of Republicans and conservatives who acknowledge that we need to do this in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 I think you interviewed Senator Simpson, who made that quite clear.\xc2\xa0 I think Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, on FOX News, expressed that sentiment last night.\xc2\xa0 Numerous members of Congress -- Senator Lindsey Graham yesterday has said this.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- it seems self-evident that the leaders in Washington should, in a situation like this, where the problems are recognized by everyone, the need for solutions and the urgent need for solutions are recognized by everyone, that then we should come together and compromise; not say, no way, no how, on every absolutist position that you might hold.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to address just the entitlement component of it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do, Jake, is publicly say what all of our positions are on these issues because that\xe2\x80\x99s stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in a negotiating room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Republicans are saying that they can\xe2\x80\x99t get commitments.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the room; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the truth is.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans are saying that they can\xe2\x80\x99t get commitments. Mitch McConnell said that an administration official, which I believe is Budget Director Jack Lew -- he asked him how much would there be in entitlement cuts next year, and Lew said -- McConnell did not identify him, but it was Lew -- (laughter) -- and Lew said $2 billion, which is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- actually that\xe2\x80\x99s not talking about entitlements.\xc2\xa0 And that is just a false moving of the chains here when we -- you got to compare apples to apples.\xc2\xa0 The President has already committed to significant non-defense discretionary cuts that were embodied in the CR compromises that fulfill the fiscal year funding of 2011.\xc2\xa0 And what the President is seeking and the commitments he\xe2\x80\x99s made in terms of the spending he likes\xc2\xa0 -- he would accept and seeks, in terms of non-defense discretionary spending, to lock in the savings represented from last year, represented in the CR, and to take them even further, and not just to have savings in one year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But one of the reasons why he wants a big deal is because you can get a medium-size deal or a smaller deal, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deal with your long-term problem.\xc2\xa0 Only a significantly sized deal in the trillions of dollars, between $3-$4 trillion is what we mostly talked about, over 10 to 12 years, that\'s the only way to really get at the problem of debt-to-GDP ratio -- to bring those costs in line so that we can get our fiscal house in order. That\'s what the President wants. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he is willing to cut deeply in discretionary spending, carefully.\xc2\xa0 He\'s willing to cut significantly in defense spending, if you do it carefully and maintain our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 He\'s willing to reform entitlements and find savings there.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s absolutely willing, of course, to make sure that it\'s balanced and that we find savings in our tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was McConnell talking about with this $2 billion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s apples to oranges here.\xc2\xa0 He\'s measuring -- he\'s taking one standard and applying another to get a figure to make a political point.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s -- the budgeters understand how this works and what you measure against.\xc2\xa0 And the savings the President is willing to find and accept are significant.\xc2\xa0 Everybody who\'s been a part of this process knows that -- people who were in the budget negotiations, in the negotiations led by the Vice President, and everybody knows for a fact because we all lived through it, the negotiations that led to the compromise that forestalled -- that prevented a government shutdown for fiscal year 2011 spending represent the largest and most significant cuts in spending that we\'ve seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is real money and real reduction in spending the President has been committed to and he remains committed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\'s next?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the White House concerned that the McConnell plan, while it might help avoid a default, that perhaps agencies could still take action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The question of credit agencies I\'ll put aside. What obviously is at issue here is that we will not have addressed the very problem in terms of our deficit and debt that will still be there in front of us.\xc2\xa0 So the positive impact in terms of confidence that you would get from a significant deal we will not have achieved.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it is a form of kicking the can down the road.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is, however, an important acknowledgement of the fact that we need -- regardless of where we get in our negotiations over deficit reduction, we absolutely have to make sure that the United States continues to pay its bills and fulfill its obligations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the credit agencies, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to that.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the United States will, come August 2nd, continue to be creditworthy we think is important.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a position we\xe2\x80\x99ve maintained from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President agree to something, though, that deals with obviously preventing a default but the likely ramification could be that credit agencies may take action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about credit agencies.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something we don\xe2\x80\x99t have control over.\xc2\xa0 What we think is important is that -- first, that everyone remain committed to the proposition that the United States will not for the first time in its history default on its obligations; second, that we should work diligently, daily, to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, a balanced agreement -- and a sizable one, because this is hard stuff anyway, and the principle that the President repeats in these meetings is as we look at the spending cuts that we can agree on and as we look at the measures we can take, we can agree on, and then build from there and look at some of the compromises that would need to be made in terms of entitlements and revenues and other issues and other kinds of spending cuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think people quickly recognize that none of this will be easy, that all of this will be hard.\xc2\xa0 Any deal of any significant size will entail hard choices.\xc2\xa0 Therefore it is absolutely worth it, because it\'s the right thing to do and it\'s worth it politically to go and do something and get the biggest possible deal.\xc2\xa0 Because that\'s what the President supports and I think that -- and I know that that\'s the argument he\'s making in these negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as he continues to push for that big deal, is he concerned that at a certain point he appears ineffective pushing for the biggest deal possible when it seems obvious that it\'s likely not going to be the basis for an agreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you in the room, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware that you were as knowledgeable about how the negotiations are going as you seem to be.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we remain confident that we will get an agreement that reduces spending, that cuts the deficit.\xc2\xa0 What is at issue here is can we get something -- how significant an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And he is absolutely confident that it is the right position to take to push this process forward to get the biggest possible deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s no secret that he\'s still pushing for a bigger deal than seems likely or that Republicans have ruled out.\xc2\xa0 So is he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, wait, wait, the Republicans haven\'t ruled out a big deal.\xc2\xa0 They have ruled out -- they have made a lot of declarative statements about what\'s acceptable and non-acceptable, even though an increasing number of people have -- even Republican and conservatives -- have taken opposite positions.\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re saying that they\'ve said compromise is impossible, I just don\'t think that\'s in the end for sure --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m saying not pushing for the $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to push for the largest deal possible, an indication that he\'s pushing for the $4 trillion, even though it seems unlikely --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s pushing for the largest deal possible.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that $4 trillion in a balanced way would be the best possible outcome.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously other potential outcomes short of $4 trillion, but the bigger, the better, if it\'s balanced and it\'s considered and it makes significant cuts in domestic spending, significant cuts in defense spending, but ones that allow us to protect our national security and allows us to invest in ways that will continue to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And so he\'s absolutely pushing for the biggest deal possible.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we have TV cameras in for the top of the meeting today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are doing a photo stills spray today.\xc2\xa0 I would remind you that the last time we had TV cameras in the meeting it was less than three hours after the President had given a press conference, and people shouted questions at him, including people who had just had questions in the press conference.\xc2\xa0 So the purpose of the meeting is not to create a circus but to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 So today we\'re doing stills only.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Questions are a circus?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you telling us we can\'t ask questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He asked questions -- he took -- he had a 70-minute press conference last week.\xc2\xa0 He had a 45-minute press conference three hours before people walked in and created --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- exhausted everything that we wanted to ask?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the President will certainly take questions again.\xc2\xa0 But we have -- they have work to do, so this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the record it\'s absurd to say that we can\'t ask questions when we go in there with a camera --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying that, Chip.\xc2\xa0 You had questions that day --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\'re not allowed to ask more questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and he took 70 minutes of questions the day before.\xc2\xa0 You certainly are.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying we\'re just going to do a photo spray today -- still photo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s an absurd reason to say that because we asked questions you\'re not going to allow cameras in there. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s perfectly capable of ignoring the questions.\xc2\xa0 He does it all the time. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, I think that\'s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your opinion, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how the meeting went yesterday generally?\xc2\xa0 And is the President surprised or concerned that John Boehner seems to be pulling back and leaving the lead -- giving the lead position to Eric Cantor, who seems far less inclined to compromise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The meeting yesterday was constructive.\xc2\xa0 It allowed participants to exchange different views about how we can build on the cuts that we can agree on and how we can get from small to medium to large.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the -- the President is working with every member of Congress who is in that room.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s team is working with every member of Congress in that room, and that includes obviously the Speaker and the Majority Leader.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is not about personalities.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about doing something for the American people that needs to be done but isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily easy and requires compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Cantor has made very clear he is less inclined to compromise.\xc2\xa0 So does that change the tone in the room away from compromise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that -- what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, that this is not a time for maximalist positions or we won\xe2\x80\x99t do this, no way, no how -- that\xe2\x80\x99s really not an option if your goal, the stated goal, the primary objective since the midterm elections that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Republican leaders and rank-and-file members is we need to get our spending under control, we need to reduce the deficit, we need to deal with the long-term debt. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a vast collection of comments and analysis that says the best way to do that -- and this is vast, I mean, from a broad political spectrum -- the best way to do that is to take a balanced approach, significant cuts in defense -- I mean, in non-defense discretionary spending, significant cuts in defense spending, significant savings in entitlements, and significant savings from the tax code, plus interest.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you get something big that is done in a way that does not upset the apple cart and does not shift the burden entirely on one sector of society -- seniors, for example, or disabled children or their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So everybody ought to share in the sacrifice here.\xc2\xa0 But by definition, when you\xe2\x80\x99re reducing our deficits and debt by, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years, it requires sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has always been that the sacrifice ought to be shared; that if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for sacrifice from middle-class families, then you ought to be asking for sacrifice from people who have been extremely fortunate like himself, people who, say, are able to buy private jets or who pay taxes at a rate significantly lower on the billion dollars in income -- at a significantly lower rate than a fireman or a teacher.\xc2\xa0 So these are not unreasonable positions to take when everybody should be sacrificing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, does the President plan to just open it up to people to talk, or will he lead the meeting?\xc2\xa0 And does he have specific things that he wants to accomplish and a specific direction he wants it to take?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we will -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everyone will have a chance to speak.\xc2\xa0 The President tends to open these meetings.\xc2\xa0 And I think that different positions will be presented as we look at the areas where there is agreement, the areas where agreement is relatively close to being within reach, and areas where there is significant disagreement that there needs to be negotiation about.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how this process hopefully will move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 He has ruled out a 30 or a 60 or a 90-day extension.\xc2\xa0 But if they\xe2\x80\x99re close --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He said 180 days, too. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re close, is he ruling out a one-week stopgap so they can complete the negotiation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what the President thinks we ought to do is get down to work and do our jobs.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, the elected leaders who are here in Washington ought to do their jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know how it works -- you get to the end, you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite have enough time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is enough time to get this done.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on the present right now and try to achieve something significant.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 We believe there is momentum in the direction -- contrary to some of what you hear in the public sphere, there is momentum towards achieving significant deficit reduction in a balanced way, and not to grab hold of that and try to reach something significant would be a failure of leadership.\xc2\xa0 So the President believes very strongly that we need to -- that leaders need to lead; that in that room people need to say this is not about politics, this is not about comparative advantages in next year\xe2\x80\x99s election; it\xe2\x80\x99s about doing what\xe2\x80\x99s right, and we ought to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, any regrets here at the White House about expanding the group that\xe2\x80\x99s in these meetings every day?\xc2\xa0 I mean, by expanding the group, you obviously have more -- strong personalities --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Greater diversity of opinion, you might say? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Strong personalities in the room that go on camera and say some tough things sometimes that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering at this point, after these daily meetings, whether you kind of wish maybe it was a smaller group.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that anything that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be passed by Congress needs to have been worked through with and hopefully sanctioned by the leaders of Congress of both parties.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the optimum situation that you hope for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, no, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any regrets about bringing in the leaders of Congress from both parties into these negotiations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was true and will continue to be true that there are obviously -- in terms of getting into the nitty-gritty and moving this process forward, there are regular and constant discussions at a high-level staff level, as well as sidebar conversations between different members and between the administration and lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s how this thing -- how Washington negotiation moves forward.\xc2\xa0 But we believe these meetings have been worthwhile, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re having another one today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the idea of having Leader Pelosi or Senator McConnell in the room because you\xe2\x80\x99re also thinking you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need votes from their constituents in order to get a deal through?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that there is no significant achievement that can emerge out of this that will not require votes from Democrats and Republicans in both houses.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some on Capitol Hill have suggested talking about Social Security checks yesterday was a scare tactic.\xc2\xa0 You guys have a response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think best to look at the interview or read the transcript rather than react to what some people might be saying about the interview.\xc2\xa0 The President was asked a question and he answered it honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I was saying earlier, I think in response to questions that Julie had, or Matt, that our position, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, has always been that we will not get to that point because Congress will do the right thing, and the United States will not, for the first time in its history, default on its obligations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is simply a matter of fact that when you have one dollar in obligations and you only have 60 cents in your pocket, you\'ve got to borrow 40 cents in order to meet those obligations, but your authority to borrow that 40 cents has been eliminated, that you are then in a bind, and you have to make choices about how and where to apply the 60 cents that you have in your pocket.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we do not believe that that will happen, that that outcome is what awaits us, because we believe that leaders will take the right actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that there\xe2\x80\x99s momentum in the talks.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a fuller idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that we\xe2\x80\x99re like a boulder rolling down a hill here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s momentum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how is this different -- is this meeting going to be different than Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, Monday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting and Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, every meeting is different, and they move -- one of the things that I think is worth repeating, that I mentioned I believe yesterday or the other day, is that, remember that a lot of the members here were not participants in the regular meetings that the Vice President presided over and have not been engaged at the level of detail that they are now engaged in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So some of this was involving the leaders at the level of detail that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to make decisions.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s all been sweetness and light, but it has been productive and it has moved forward and it has been clarifying.\xc2\xa0 Information has been shared that has been new information for some members and positions have been explored that help I think everyone in the room understand what\xe2\x80\x99s possible and what\xe2\x80\x99s desirable in terms of going for something big rather than something small.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that will be the case today.\xc2\xa0 Progress -- maybe not shout-from-the-rooftops success in one meeting, but progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the immovable object in all of this is the question of revenues, is the House Republicans, fiscal conservatives among them, what you might call their intransigence, what they might call their resolve, in saying, we will not be raising taxes -- period.\xc2\xa0 Is any -- when you talk about momentum or progress, has there been any momentum or progress getting them to change their minds?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is, we think, an increasing recognition within the broader community here that a balanced approach is the right approach, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve significant deficit reduction and long-term debt reduction if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And you are hearing voices on all sides express this opinion now, and hopefully that sentiment will be infectious and spread, because we think that it is the right approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we think that it\xe2\x80\x99s really important for everybody in that room -- and, broadly, within Congress and Washington -- to sort of say -- to address themselves not to the most vocal activists in the Republican Party or the Democratic Party -- those are important, no question -- but to remember what the broader purpose is here, which is to move the country forward, to grow the economy and create jobs, to take some of the massive burden that deficits and debt place on our children and grandchildren and lift them.\xc2\xa0 And that requires addressing not narrow audiences but broad audiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And broadly, the American people expect their leaders in Washington from both parties to come together, compromise, accept that they will not get everything they want -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s the system that the Founding Fathers created for us -- and do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy.\xc2\xa0 It involves some political pain -- the President has made that clear -- for everybody.\xc2\xa0 But we have to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, can I ask you to clarify, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reporters allowed in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting because reporters misbehaved?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, as you know, we have had -- different meetings have different levels of access, and we do it on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 We have had -- the President has taken questions quite a lot lately, as you know.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not taking questions today.\xc2\xa0 He may tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Or he may later.\xc2\xa0 But today we\xe2\x80\x99re just doing a still spray -- which is not unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done still sprays in a lot of meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like -- in your earlier comments, it sounds like you were punishing the press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was making the point that if this were an issue of we just need B-roll, right, that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case hours after he had just had his second press conference in less than a week, when we\xe2\x80\x99re asking people to leave the room so the leaders can get to work, and people are shouting questions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 Look, I used to be where you are; it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to shout questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that not every occasion are we going to have a full pool in a meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today Senator McConnell said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think any Republicans will vote to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of negotiating?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him say that no Republicans will vote to raise the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think any Republicans will vote to raise the debt ceiling -- to Laura Ingraham<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura Ingraham.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I saw some comments he made that I think are unfortunate, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that one.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really make any sense to me, because he has made clear that we absolutely cannot default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 So by hook or by crook, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, on McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s plan, one thing I\xe2\x80\x99m still confused about, if the President has said he won\xe2\x80\x99t support a 30, 60, 90 or 180-day proposal -- or excuse me -- yes, a proposal, then why not outright reject the McConnell plan? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference here with what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 What the President was saying is that he would not simply say in exchange for these spending cuts we\xe2\x80\x99ll extend the debt ceiling for a few weeks or for a few months, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go through that -- not dissimilar from the approach we took during the CR negotiations, which was we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a tollbooth here; this is the United States; we\xe2\x80\x99re a more sophisticated and better country than that.\xc2\xa0 We ought to get to work and do our work and get it done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The proposal that Senator McConnell outlined is different in its particulars from that scenario that we were talking about both during the CR and the President was referring to in terms of we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do this every few months.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- let me be clear, while we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that Senator McConnell has acknowledged that under no circumstances should we default on our obligations, that would not be a satisfying outcome to us just to have that, because we think this is a unique opportunity to do something significant on deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that was, after all, the whole point.\xc2\xa0 The linkage that was created that tied significant deficit reduction to this deadline was so that we could work together, roll up our sleeves, and do this.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is ready and willing to do that.\xc2\xa0 He is willing to make compromises.\xc2\xa0 He is willing to go big here.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 He is willing to take heat to do it.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that\xe2\x80\x99s what will happen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other question.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell also said that this issue and how it turns out is a referendum on the President.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys agree with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate to view this through a purely political lens.\xc2\xa0 I made the point yesterday that the President in his press conferences and interviews hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten up there and said, you know, the debt we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here was accumulated over eight years of a former President and former Congresses, often led by Republicans, who put two wars on a credit card and didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for them; who put substantial, massive -- self-described massive tax cuts on a credit card and didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for them, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my problem.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it; it\xe2\x80\x99s their problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President recognizes that it is his responsibility to do this.\xc2\xa0 It is his responsibility to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly believes that the Republicans ought to do the same and that we\xe2\x80\x99re in this together.\xc2\xa0 This is the American economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the Democratic economy or the Republican economy.\xc2\xa0 And solving -- fulfilling our obligations is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a calculus over we\xe2\x80\x99ll do this because it will help one side or the other in the reelection or the election campaign in 2012.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here and not make it about politics or electoral politics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is politics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I said electoral politics.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, these are politicians. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama expect members of Congress who ran for office and were elected on pledges to stop spending and not raise taxes to tell their constituents, well, I got to go back on it because the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President expects members of Congress, political leaders of both parties, to abide by their principles, significantly reduce the deficit, do the things that a lot of people have talked about who came into office recently but also for a long time before that, about the need to get our deficits and debt under control, and also to make compromises necessary to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 Because, you know what, we don\xe2\x80\x99t live in a one-party system.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t live in a monarchy.\xc2\xa0 Neither party and no leader gets to say this is how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be because I say so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve covered the White House and Washington for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think significant things have happened here in your tenure that didn\xe2\x80\x99t require bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Ronald Reagan, who is honored by conservative and Republicans for his service as President, in particular because he was committed to reducing spending -- the fact is he made multiple -- he accomplished a lot working with the Republican speaker -- I mean, the Democratic speaker of the house.\xc2\xa0 And in those compromises that he achieved, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything he wanted and he actually significantly raised revenue on a number of occasions as part of an overall package to reform Social Security or tax reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of compromise we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, nobody got everything that he wanted in those budget deals that they eventually achieved.\xc2\xa0 But what they did do was put the American economy on a path towards budget surpluses that at the time when Bill Clinton left office looked like they would last for a very long time, as far as the eye could see.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either of those leaders would say that he got everything he wanted out of that, but they compromised and they did it.\xc2\xa0 And they did something significant that was good for the economy -- that during that period I think more than 20 million jobs were created.\xc2\xa0 This was good for everybody, regardless of political party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your closed-door talks aren\xe2\x80\x99t bringing you a breakthrough you want.\xc2\xa0 Maybe open-door talks might be the way to go.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Perhaps. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in there. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Perhaps.\xc2\xa0 I think that you know as well as I do that these are -- this is difficult.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why when we talk about -- and leaders of both parties have put it in these terms -- that you have to get in the boat together is because that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get this done because of the differing opinions, and that it requires approaching it this way so that we can get in the boat together and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tip over.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m open to ideas and suggestions for how we get from here to there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the last few sessions of the talks have been devoted at least in part to taking stock, going over the Biden talks and finding out where there is agreement on both sides.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how much does that add up to in terms of the agreements on both sides?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 More than a little and less than a lot. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you try again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific details because these are --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a trillion dollars --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, they\xe2\x80\x99re not there in terms of sorting out the numbers, the specifics.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going back and forth.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have taken stock of the agreements where they have agreed, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are dollar numbers attached to those.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are dollar numbers attached to those, but these break down into component parts.\xc2\xa0 And one thing the Vice President said at the beginning of every meeting that he had in those negotiations as well as in the middle and at the end, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not like you can simply say, oh, well, we agreed on all that.\xc2\xa0 And since we don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on the rest, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just take that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is -- the art of compromise here, the art of negotiation requires rebuilding a structure at this level now where everybody can say, okay, I can live with that, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want, if you give me that I can take that and this is acceptable.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, have they made any progress since the $1 trillion mark that the President -- Vice President referred to several weeks ago?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into more detail about specific numbers because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hem them in as they negotiate, because there are a lot of different moving parts here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 He met with Lavrov this morning. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you rule it out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why would I rule it out?\xc2\xa0 Looking forward to returning to Russia as much as I do, I would never rule that out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said that you\xe2\x80\x99re starting to hear voices on all sides in support of a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 Do you mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Many sides, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about voices outside the room or inside the room?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was thinking mostly of outside the room, but there is -- there are times during this process when even participants in the room have made the comment that we can deal with closing some exceptions and loopholes, we could look at subsidies and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 And remember that when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, on the revenue side of this equation as we seek balance here, to go along with significant cuts in spending and entitlement reform, there are a variety of options here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President has made clear, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask sacrifice of the middle class, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask sacrifice of the most vulnerable, or of seniors or disabled kids, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- I mean, these numbers are real.\xc2\xa0 When you cut programs or you cut -- there are consequences to that and those consequences are felt mostly by the middle class.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also -- it is a responsible thing to do to ask for sacrifice from the wealthy, from the well-off, not for its own sake but because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, and it helps us get to something big and significant, which has significant long-term benefits for the and economy and, therefore, every participant in the economy, including the middle class.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the principle at work here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not we insist revenues ought to be part of this package just because we do, but because we want to make it fair and balanced and we want to make it significant.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of voices, from the participants in the Bowles-Simpson commission, to the participants in the Domenici-Rivlin study, to a variety of current members of Congress, Republicans, who acknowledge that that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we should take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Graham, as I was just saying, closing loopholes -- a deal that curbs entitlement spending and increases tax revenues by closing loopholes "makes sense.\xc2\xa0 That way you don\xe2\x80\x99t raise tax rates but you do generate new revenue by closing loopholes.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99re giving money away to a few people at the expense of many.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely reasonable point of view.\xc2\xa0 And we think that that point of view is the right one to take as we approach this effort to find balance in a significant package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of these fallback outlines of packages like Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s and others that people talk about only have spending cuts in them.\xc2\xa0 And given the prospect that a fallback might very well be spending cuts only because of the difficulty getting agreement on revenue, you said the President insists that revenues be part of this, and shared sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 Would you -- does the President rule out supporting or signing anything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have some revenue-raising component?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to hem him in.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him answer that question when I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he might get it at some point. The point I think is important to make is that there is no significant deal here that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require balance, and that as an overarching principle, the sacrifice required to reduce our deficit should be shared and not just placed on the middle class or seniors or others.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sort of, will he do this, will they do that, rule one thing out or the other beyond the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s said about not participating in a tollbooth here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, yesterday, McConnell -- one of the things he said in the course of the day was that he does not think it is possible to get a significant or meaningful agreement, as he put it, with this President in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Did President Obama say anything to him about that yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t read out the conversations in the meeting, but I think that the President addressed this yesterday in his interview with CBS.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to point out here when I talk about the audiences that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to here.\xc2\xa0 He is the President of the United States. He is in office for at least 18 months.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is anything close to a majority, and probably just a tiny minority, of the American people who think that we ought to just cease trying to get things done in this town until one party controls everything entirely.\xc2\xa0 You know what, because that\xe2\x80\x99s never going to happen.\xc2\xa0 This is just -- this President has demonstrated that he is committed to significant spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the one out there saying let\xe2\x80\x99s get the biggest possible deal.\xc2\xa0 And that big possible deal includes significant reductions in discretionary spending, significant reductions in our defense budget, significant savings out of the entitlement programs, and significant savings out of our tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it involves making tough choices that are not politically comfortable.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what he expects -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what he knows the American people expect of him, and he thinks that they expect it of leaders of both parties in Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concern here that the main motivation for McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was to shift the political blame for raising the debt ceiling purely onto the President\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We look at it simply in terms of the factual acknowledgment here that there is no alternative to the United States maintaining its creditworthiness and fulfilling its obligations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important acknowledgment.\xc2\xa0 The analysis of the political component of this we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to you guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point I want to make is that that is not the preferred option because we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what this has been about.\xc2\xa0 This has been about trying to do something significant and real on reducing spending and propelling our economy forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s been -- and this is on a totally unrelated subject for you -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been continuing revelations about the Murdochs and News Corp.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Commerce Committee chairman, Senator Rockefeller, called on appropriate agencies to look into it.\xc2\xa0 And today Senate Lautenberg, his counterpart, called on DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission to look at it under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\xc2\xa0 Is this situation on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s radar, and is DOJ, to your knowledge, in contact with their counterparts in Britain to find out whether any U.S. laws have been implicated?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not on our radar in the sense that we\xe2\x80\x99re having discussions about it.\xc2\xa0 Everyone reads newspapers and catches the news reports, so we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of it.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we have some other issues we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the Department of Justice and the SEC, I would just refer you to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on just a completely unrelated subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that Brian Bond, who was in charge of constituency relations for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues, is leaving the White House for the DNC.\xc2\xa0 Currently, there\xe2\x80\x99s no senior LGBT advisor to the President on this issue, arguably one of the biggest civil rights questions of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 Does he -- does the President plan to appoint someone to advise him on these issues going forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements for you.\xc2\xa0 I think that his record on these issues is something he is proud of and he gets advice from a lot of quarters.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement for you on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On July 7th, DOJ announced it would no longer oppose married, same-sex couples who are seeking to file joint bankruptcy petitions.\xc2\xa0 And that was a move that DOJ had opposed in the past, basing it on DOMA.\xc2\xa0 You in the briefing room, however, in the past have said that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the ability to waive a magic wand and change policy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wish he did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that was with regards to immigration situation and same-sex couples seeking equal treatment.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what the difference between those situations is, and also, whether or not the President supports DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow same-sex couples to file join bankruptcy petitions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I honestly haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about this with him in terms of that specific decision by DOJ, so I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to that.\xc2\xa0 I think the overall principle that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a magic wand -- although some of us wish he did sometimes, maybe this week in particular -- to make things happen is just a statement of fact.\xc2\xa0 And there are processes that involve legal analysis and decisions that obviously are handled over at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information for you on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has said that until there are final court rulings that he expects DOMA to be enforced.\xc2\xa0 Is this situation -- does the President feel that this is enforcing DOMA by allowing same-sex couples to file joint bankruptcy petitions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can take that question for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chrissy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President open to discussion of a balanced budget amendment as part of a debt deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we do not need to amend the Constitution to cut the deficit.\xc2\xa0 We need to get beyond politics as usual, and find bipartisan common ground. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A balanced budget amendment has, today and has always been, about ducking responsibility rather than taking our challenges head on.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t need -- I mean, the Constitution should not be used to simply abdicate responsibility.\xc2\xa0 What we need to do here is not complicated.\xc2\xa0 It does not require a constitutional amendment and the ratification by preponderance of states here.\xc2\xa0 It requires people rolling up their sleeves -- the leaders, the representatives of the people in the Congress and the President, the Vice President and others here -- and working out a compromise to achieve a goal that we all share, which is significant deficit reduction, a plan that gets our fiscal house in order that deals with our long-term debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is something we can do.\xc2\xa0 And in some ways, while these are hard issues, it is something we can do easily if people accept the principle that we have to compromise to do it.\xc2\xa0 So, no, we do not support the balanced budget amendments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, can you just say is -- are Medicare cuts on or off the table at this point?\xc2\xa0 And do you -- is that something the President intends to turn attention to today, at today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Entitlement savings are something that we will absolutely continue to look at.\xc2\xa0 Again, if you talk about the building blocks towards a significant package of deficit reduction, entitlements savings are -- represent one of those big building blocks, but it requires compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President intent on taking that up today, that particular --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the mix?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s always possible that that will come up.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an itemized agenda for today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a very strong case every day here to tell us that the President has tried to work with the leadership, in a sense making compromises and making some concessions as much as he can.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that the Gallup poll has come out today saying that most of the American people do not want their representative to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 In spite of the fact that the President was on TV last night and talked about certain things that would be at stake, do you feel at all that this administration has not really laid out in very strong terms what exactly is at stake for the American people if this debt limit is not raised?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher, we have focused not on laying out the consequences of default, because we believe and take leaders in Congress at their word that action will be taken to prevent that from happening.\xc2\xa0 We have focused our energies, rather, on trying to achieve a deficit reduction compromise that gets our fiscal house in order. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to understand why most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time to focus on what is a debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I mean, honestly, did anybody in this room, before they had to cover issues like this, have any idea what a debt ceiling was?\xc2\xa0 Any understanding of the fact that a vote by Congress to increase our ability to borrow was simply a vote to allow the United States of America to pay the bills that it incurred in the past?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think every American, or certainly a vast majority of Americans, would accept the principle, if asked, that the United States should pay its bills, just like they\xe2\x80\x99re asked to pay their bills.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again -- but we have not focused on the consequences of default because we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there will be a default.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:51 P.M.
