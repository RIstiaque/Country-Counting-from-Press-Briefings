EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us on this long flight into the future, rocketing forward with a very forward-looking agenda.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean when we come home we\xe2\x80\x99re looking backwards?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when we come home we can look back at everything we accomplished for the future.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI have with me Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, who can take some of your questions about the trip thus far and the trip coming up, and I\xe2\x80\x99m here to take other random questions that you might have.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A domestic one real quick for our friends at home.\xc2\xa0 Could you fill us in on the President\xe2\x80\x99s super committee-related calls?\xc2\xa0 Also, we read that Senator Reid and House Speaker Boehner had spoken.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken with either of them?\xc2\xa0 How has he been getting updates and who has he talked to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 We did, I believe, read out the calls he made at the beginning of the trip to the two co-chairs of the select committee, Senator Murray and Congressman Hensarling.\xc2\xa0 He has not made any other calls to members of Congress related to the super committee\xe2\x80\x99s work since those calls.\xc2\xa0 He is updated regularly, obviously, through staff on a variety of issues and a variety of matters before Congress, including the work of the super committee.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have not -- I saw the same reports you did about the Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader having a conversation about the super committee, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction from the President on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is he staying in touch?\xc2\xa0 Who is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Rob Nabors; Bill Daley, who headed back, obviously, to Washington; Pete Rouse; Jack Lew; Treasury officials -- everybody you might expect to be engaged on this issue available to engage on it, and certainly Rob is regularly connecting with leaders and staff on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another domestic matter, does the President have any reaction to the way the Occupy Wall Street protesters were removed, how that was handled?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it, obviously, from the reports.\xc2\xa0 And our position and the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is that obviously every municipality has to make its own decisions about how to handle these issues, and we would hope and want, as these decisions are made, that it balances between a long tradition of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in this country and obviously of demonstrating and protesting, and also the very important need to maintain law and order and health and safety standards, which was obviously a concern in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you preview for us the military announcement in Australia that\xe2\x80\x99s been widely previewed by the Australians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Over to Mr. Rhodes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say that on the -- this trip will be an opportunity to mark the 60th anniversary of the alliance on that occasion.\xc2\xa0 And looking forward, the two leaders will be able to announce an increased security cooperation between the United States and Australia, including an increased U.S. presence in Australia.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the leaders speak to some of the precise details of this in their bilateral meeting today and in their press conference after that bilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I think this will speak to the deepening cooperation between the United States and Australia.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in response to Australia\xe2\x80\x99s interest in pursuing that cooperation, and it will enable us to, again -- as you heard Admiral Willard say the other day -- will enable the United States to have greater geographic balance in the Asia Pacific region and will enable us to respond to a range of interests in the Pacific region as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, will this entail any additional costs, or will there be savings, even?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that this would entail forces that -- I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a context where, of course, a lot of U.S. deployments are being reduced because of the end of the wars, and so therefore there is an ability for the U.S. to draw from global forces that aren\xe2\x80\x99t prepositioned elsewhere for these types of -- for the types of responsibilities that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about later today.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you a dollar amount on it, but we can check on that, and as we fill in some of the details of this, I can get some more specifics on the cost.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you even able to say whether it is a cost or a savings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check that for you as to how they\xe2\x80\x99re accounting for it within the DOD context.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, could you please directly address the widespread perception that an increased U.S. military presence in Australia is driven by a desire, at least in part, to contain China, to offset China\xe2\x80\x99s strong presence in that region?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of factors that lead us to want to increase our cooperation with Australia and to ensure that we have an appropriate military posture in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that runs the gamut.\xc2\xa0 So, for instance, a lot of the things that you heard Admiral Willard talk about involve U.S. military forces being able to respond to natural disasters, as they did after the tsunami -- the Japanese earthquake -- the tsunami in Indonesia and the Japanese earthquake.\xc2\xa0 U.S. forces are engaged in efforts to counter piracy and counter terrorism in parts of Southeast Asia.\xc2\xa0 And U.S. forces provide an anchor of stability and security in the region more generally, and that can provide for maritime security, the free flow of commerce.\xc2\xa0 So simply the U.S. presence and the reassurance that that presence provides is important to the continued peaceful development of the region, the continued free flow of commerce, and the continued ability to deal in a forward-leaning way with the types of challenges that emerge in this part of the world -- again, which run the gamut from terrorism and criminality and piracy to natural disasters in addition to just, again, providing that basis of security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not really a mention of China at all among those factors.\xc2\xa0 Is that focusing in too narrowly on one country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we have a broad -- we have a broad posture in the Asia Pacific, running from Korea to Japan to Australia, partnerships that we engage in with our other allies like the Philippines or Thailand.\xc2\xa0 And what we look at is how does our general force posture allow us to protect U.S. interests, protect our allies, and, again, secure the region broadly.</p>\n<p>\n\tChina is obviously a piece of the Asia Pacific region, an emerging power.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99d like to do with the Chinese, frankly, as it relates to our military, one of our first orders of business is we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on increasing military-to-military cooperation with the Chinese, precisely because it can facilitate greater dialogue and understanding and ability to resolve issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, again, we want to make sure that the United States is positioned to play its critical role as really the anchor of security and stability in the region in general.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, is the East Asia Summit an appropriate place to discuss the territorial disputes of the South China Sea?\xc2\xa0 China says that they should be addressed individually among each party.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that the issue of maritime security is an appropriate issue to discuss at the East Asia Summit, and in the context of discussion about maritime security, the South China Sea will clearly be a concern.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not -- as we said in I think our set-up briefing, the East Asia Summit is not a tribunal.\xc2\xa0 So the East Asia Summit is not a forum to resolve specific territorial questions, but rather it\xe2\x80\x99s a forum to address the principles with which we approach these issues -- our commitment to freedom of navigation, for instance; our commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to have a discussion of maritime security; the South China Sea will be a part of that discussion.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on are the principles that we feel are essential to the continued stability and free flow of commerce in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not a tribunal where you have individual countries resolving territorial claims in the context of the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in that sense would you sort of -- do you not support the Philippine initiative that they\xe2\x80\x99re putting forward to try to solve -- discuss some of these issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We support the ability of all nations to raise their concerns in the context of the East Asia Summit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a forum where, again, political leadership can address issues that are of concern to them.\xc2\xa0 We have supported, for instance, having a leaders retreat at the East Asia Summit where there could be a strategic level of political and security discussion.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of that discussion, different leaders will raise different issues, and that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have said -- the United States, for instance -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the issue of maritime security and the issue of nonproliferation.\xc2\xa0 But, again, so I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for leaders to raise issues that are important to them, to reaffirm our principles as it applies to maritime security, even as I think there are continued territorial claims that are going to have to be resolved going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President said publicly whether he believes that the nine-dash line* is a legally legitimate line in the South China Sea dispute?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check what -- the specifics of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, we have a view of these matters that we want to see them resolved consistent with international norms, international laws.\xc2\xa0 And I think therefore this would have to be dealt with in that context.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he and Hu not talk about it in depth during their meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, they did not.\xc2\xa0 Again, as we said, that meeting focused primarily on economic matters.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the President is having bilateral meetings in Bali with the Philippines, with a number of countries that in the past have raised these issues.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly, in addition to the summit itself, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that will likely come up in some of his bilateral meetings as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there was no security discussion at all in the Hu and Obama bilat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There was a discussion, as we said the other day, on North Korea, on Iran, on military-to-military ties.\xc2\xa0 But the meeting focused overwhelmingly on economic issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No discussion as to the South China Sea commercial lanes*?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into a detailed discussion.\xc2\xa0 I can check if it came up at all, but it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a focus of the meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you distinguish between APEC, which we just left, and the East Asia Summit and ASEAN regional forum in terms of the extent to which they overlap or -- because in the past the U.S. has depended more on APEC for economic -- so what do you see as the distinguishing characteristics -- why do two summits with the same countries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think, as a general matter, we have felt that the U.S. was underrepresented in these organizations when we came into office.\xc2\xa0 We had not consistently engaged at a high level.\xc2\xa0 We had not even really been a part of the East Asia Summit, for instance.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we believe -- as you heard Secretary Clinton say -- we believe that the Asia Pacific region needs the architecture of organizations and institutions that can deal with challenges and that can foster cooperation just as the transatlantic community has those types of arrangements.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, when we look at these different organizations, we see APEC as a critical forum for fostering regional economic integration in the Asia Pacific, fostering more open and fair trade among the nations of the region.\xc2\xa0 And so we see APEC as our primary vehicle for advancing economic cooperation in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the East Asia Summit, it has highly focused on economic development in the past, but we also believe that the East Asia Summit can be a forum for addressing political and security issues as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, for instance, we have pursued issues such as nonproliferation, maritime security, disaster relief in the context of the East Asia Summit, because we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s an effective forum to have leader-level strategic discussions about political and security issues in addition to the focus on economic development.</p>\n<p>\n\tASEAN itself is just -- as a grouping of the Southeast Asian nations, is a multilateral forum that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not a member of, but it provides an opportunity for us to engage with a number of key emerging economies and democracies on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it a practice of the President to meet on an annual basis with the leaders of the ASEAN nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it speaks to the importance of which we see the ASEAN nations.\xc2\xa0 I think, both economically and politically, it\xe2\x80\x99s an emerging block of countries that we want to be deepening our cooperation with.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President raising with our ASEAN partners the political and security issues we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, but also is interested in increasing U.S. exports.\xc2\xa0 So I think there will be discussion of that in the bilateral meetings in Bali and in the ASEAN meeting as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, to summarize, APEC is primarily our principal vehicle for advancing economic integration in the region.\xc2\xa0 EAS provides an additional opportunity, we think, to have political and security discussions in addition to the economic focus.\xc2\xa0 And then ASEAN provides an opportunity for us to engage with Southeast Asian nations as a block on all of these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, do you have any further updates on developments in Syria in terms of responses to Syria?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specific that came from the talks with Medvedev or others that he found effective?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President -- we have had a strategy, essentially, of trying to work with our European allies principally to impose very strong sanctions on the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve called for President Assad to step down from power.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to work closely with the regional countries.\xc2\xa0 Turkey, for instance, we\xe2\x80\x99ve coordinated closely with as they have ratcheted up their pressure on the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And the Arab League, we have consulted with a number of Arab states the last several weeks about what they might do.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe saw it as a very important step by the Arab League to, again, reduce its diplomatic ties with the Syrian government, to recall a number of Arab League ambassadors.\xc2\xa0 I think that sent an important signal that the tide is shifting away from President Assad in the international community and in the region, that he cannot look for support to the other countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s comments today further point to the fact that President Assad is isolated.\xc2\xa0 We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken, and believe that it sends a critical message to President Assad that, again, he cannot crack down and repress the aspirations of his people.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we think it reinforces the fact that he should step down because that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we see a growing tide of international opinion against President Assad.\xc2\xa0 We welcome that and have sought to build upon that, to apply pressure on the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 I think in his meetings at APEC, the President pointed to the fact that you saw this tide turning against Assad.\xc2\xa0 With President Medvedev, for instance, he pointed to the fact of the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s actions as further indications that there needs to be a continued and stronger international front against Syria.\xc2\xa0 We obviously disagreed with the Russian action at the U.N. -- at the Security Council.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be focused on is working with all these nations to apply as much pressure on the Assad regime as possible so that they finally stop the crackdown against peaceful protesters and allow for a democratic transition to go forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can the two of you preview the address to Parliament and characterize how important that is to this trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important -- it\xe2\x80\x99s basically the major speech of the trip.\xc2\xa0 We see it as an opportunity, on the one hand, to celebrate the U.S.-Australian alliance, which is among our closest in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s manifested in the cooperation that we have in Afghanistan, the security cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be addressing in the bilateral meeting, as well as in a trade relationship that is very win-win oriented that supports opportunity and jobs in both countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing the alliance.\xc2\xa0 But then more broadly, the President will be treating this as an opportunity to lay out his vision of the Asia Pacific region going forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing three core areas that the United States is committed to in the region -- one being the continued security of the region and the role that the United States will play on behalf of that security; two being a deepened economic integration across the region in a way that sees expanded trade and builds upon measures like the TPP and the APEC Summit to be increasing those trade flows; and third, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing our commitment to democracy and human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tA key part of our alliance with Australia is our shared values.\xc2\xa0 The United States is invested in the success of emerging democracies across the region and empowering those democratic models.\xc2\xa0 And we also speak out on issues related to human rights, whether it be, for instance, the situation in Burma, where we have seen some positive movement, but of course we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a continued change by the -- in the behavior of the government with respect to human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll cover the landscape of our Asia Pacific policy going forward in those three main areas -- security, economics and values -- with the Australian alliance, of course, being a model, frankly, for how partnerships can advance those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There won\xe2\x80\x99t be time in Indonesia for the President to go back and look at any of his childhood sites or anything like that, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have a very busy official schedule, and so our time is filled up with meetings and summit -- the summit.\xc2\xa0 He did obviously spend time as a child in Jakarta, principally, been to Bali on numerous occasions, finished his first book there.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no time on the schedule for him to be able to revisit those sites.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we get an exact text of the speech in enough advance of the -- and he will stick to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a briefing tonight after the press conference in which we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to walk through the speech in some greater detail, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make every effort to at least have some form of excerpts there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A logistical question about that.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the news conference, and then you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that briefing right after, or some time after?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the complication is that some of us have to go to the dinner -- the parliamentary dinner.\xc2\xa0 Or all of us, actually.\xc2\xa0 So we just have to basically do it -- so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the precise logistics, but we basically have to do it before we go to that dinner, or else it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be really late, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be to the pool, or the whole press corps?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As many as we can -- as many people as we can.\xc2\xa0 I think the intention was the whole press corps, if that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- I just wanted to add one more thing to the preview.\xc2\xa0 I think he also will be taking head on this question of whether -- the extent to which the U.S. can advance a very aggressive agenda in the region, even in the context of our commitments to cut the budget, obviously.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking that context head on in the speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be making a financial commitment to the region, or will it be -- will it essentially move the ball from what he said the other day at the CEO summit, which was, I know we have fiscal challenges at home but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to abandon --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We can get into some more detail tonight.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I think his view is, again, we are, as a general matter, seeking to send a very clear signal that across a range of areas -- trade, security and others -- we are prioritizing our engagement in the Asia Pacific given its importance going forward, and that will be the gist of the message.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, quick question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an audit out about the Federal Housing Administration saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a 50 percent chance that they could run out of money and may need taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And will it affect the \xe2\x80\x9cWe Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait\xe2\x80\x9d proposal that the President announced in Nevada?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that, so I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps somebody back in Washington can look into it for you.\xc2\xa0 But I have not seen that.</p>\n<p>\n\tCould I also just -- before we wrap up, I just wanted to make a point, because I was asked about our engagement with the super committee.\xc2\xa0 And I think it goes without saying, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say it anyway, that this President, at the beginning of the process, delivered to the committee a detailed proposal filled with his ideas of how this process could move forward and what the path is towards a resolution here, a balanced approach that asks for a shared burden, shared responsibility so that no single sector of society has to bear the brunt of balancing our -- or rather getting our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember when some members of Congress say, well, we need the President to engage -- well, they should check their inbox of their emails because they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a detailed plan that\xe2\x80\x99s very balanced, that requires tough choices for everybody, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve had it in their email box since I think September 19, 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:36 P.M.
