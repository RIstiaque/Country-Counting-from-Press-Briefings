Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">1:31 P.M. EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here on this bright and sunny Monday.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make so I\'ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Julie.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 First, just as a practical matter, who does the U.S. consider to be the leader of Ukraine at this point?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Mr. Yanukovych has left Kyiv in an orderly fashion -- packed up his things and left, and his whereabouts are not known to us in a confirmable way.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, while he was a democratically elected leader, his actions have undermined his legitimacy and he is not actively leading the country at present.\xc2\xa0 We do believe that parliament has lawfully elected its new speaker and we support getting the situation under control in terms of law and order and in ensuring that the institutions of government are working.\xc2\xa0 We note that recent parliamentary votes have been passed by overwhelming majorities that include members of Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s own party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We believe that working pursuant to Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s constitution and through its institutions of government is the most promising path toward the de-escalation of violence, a multiparty coalition government and early elections, all things that we have long supported.\xc2\xa0 It will be critical, in our view, in the coming days for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to focus on its pressing financial challenges, and we stand ready to support them as they make needed reforms.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, the U.S. sees the speaker of the parliament as the current acting leader of Ukraine, not Yanukovych?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe he is the lawfully elected speaker of parliament.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Yanukovych left Kyiv and packed up his belongings and left, and his whereabouts are not known, so he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not actively leading the country at present.\xc2\xa0 We encourage the Ukrainian parliament and others to take actions that help continue a path toward de-escalation of violence, embrace constitutional change and move toward a coalition government -- a multiparty coalition government, as well as early elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The people of Ukraine are being heard -- their voices are being heard, and we have a real opportunity here -- or rather, they do -- to move beyond the current crisis in order to pursue the more democratic future the people of their country deserve.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russian officials are questioning the legitimacy of the acting government in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the U.S. that Russia may try to wield some kind of influence or take steps to install a government in Ukraine that is perhaps more favorable to the Russians?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think you heard the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor say yesterday, Russia and the United States have a shared interest in restoring Ukraine to stability, in de-escalating violence and supporting the formation of a technical government with broad-based support across Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest to have tens of thousands of people in the street, deeply discontent with a government that they were closely backing.\xc2\xa0 And instability and violence in Ukraine is certainly not -- should not be seen as in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So we are focused on working with Ukraine, and also our European partners as well as Russia, towards promoting a process that is nonviolent, that focuses on addressing the many challenges that Ukraine faces, including the need to set up a multiparty coalition government -- a technocratic government that can help Ukraine make some of the important decisions that need to be made, especially in the economic and financial sphere, while they move towards early elections.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess how concerning is it to the U.S. that the Russians are not recognizing this acting government?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like you can\'t get to the scenario that you\'re talking about if you don\'t have that basic recognition.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the future of Ukraine should be and must be decided by the Ukrainian people, not by outside entities -- not the United States, not Europe, not Russia.\xc2\xa0 So the issue here is for the people of Ukraine to move forward towards a process that leads to the creation of a coalition government, a government that has within it representatives of all sectors of Ukraine and Ukrainian society, that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the technical work that needs to be done to stabilize the country as it moves towards free and fair democratic elections.</p>\n<p class="p2">It\xe2\x80\x99s in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see further violence and instability in Ukraine -- certainly not in the interest of the Ukrainian people, not in the interest of Russia, Europe, or the United States.\xc2\xa0 And our view -- and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been stating this quite clearly -- that this is not a competition between East and West, this is not a restoration of the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 This is about the Ukrainian people and their future.\xc2\xa0 And there is no contradiction in Ukraine and Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s people deciding to move forward with further integration with Europe while Ukraine and the Ukrainian people maintain their strong historic, cultural and economic ties to Russia.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\'s entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally on this topic, some of the opposition leaders are calling for Yanukovych to go on trial.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. have any view on that proposal?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of decisions that would have to be up to the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 Our focus right now is on encouraging steps that lead to the formation, as I said, of a multiparty unity government that speaks for all the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p class="p2">And when we say multiparty, we obviously mean by that inclusion of Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s party.\xc2\xa0 There needs to be a government that represents everyone.\xc2\xa0 And, as I noted earlier, the measures that have been passed by the parliament in the past several days have included large majorities that include votes from members of Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s party, which is worth noting.</p>\n<p class="p3">Steve.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you believe he should be granted due process, or arrested, or -- do you have a position on that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, these aren\xe2\x80\x99t positions for us to take.\xc2\xa0 We are for a de-escalation of violence, for the establishment of a coalition government that\xe2\x80\x99s representative of all sectors of Ukrainian society, and a focus on the steps that need to be taken to stabilize Ukraine and move towards early elections.\xc2\xa0 We are for the territorial integrity and independence and unity of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we with other partners are standing ready to assist Ukraine moving forward as it deals with the challenges that the country faces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that you\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the Russians are going to stand aside and let events unfold in Ukraine?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have obviously been in regular contact with many nations who are concerned about and have an interest in the developments in Ukraine, and that includes with Russian government officials all the way up to President Putin.\xc2\xa0 As you know, President Obama spoke at length with President Putin on Friday about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry spoke with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I think yesterday, and Ambassador McFaul has also had conversations with government officials.\xc2\xa0 And I think the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having reinforce what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying about views in terms of the need for the Ukrainian people to decide their future, the need for a de-escalation in violence and a return to stability as that process moves forward, and our view that it is certainly not in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest for there to be violence and instability in Ukraine and for what we saw in the past weeks and months with tens of thousands of people, of Ukrainians, or more, demonstrating, and then being engulfed in violence over their opposition to a government that was closely allied with Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So we\xe2\x80\x99re having those conversations all the time.\xc2\xa0 And again, we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest -- most importantly, the Ukrainian people\xe2\x80\x99s interest -- that this process be allowed to move forward in a peaceful way so that they can get about the business of establishing a coalition government and addressing some of the many pressing issues that they face, and having early elections.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s estimated that Ukraine needs $35 billion in assistance by the end of 2015.\xc2\xa0 Should that be done strictly through the IMF, or can the United States give some money on its own?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States, working with partners around the world, stands ready to provide support for Ukraine as it takes the reforms it needs to get back to economic stability.\xc2\xa0 This support can complement an IMF program by helping to make reforms easier and by putting Ukraine in a position to invest more in health and education, to help develop Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s human capital and strengthen its social safety net.\xc2\xa0 So we would be working with international partners to complement an IMF program going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Let me start over here with Chuck.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go right to left.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why, in all this talk about -- there was some talks about sanctions and certain things going a certain way with Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Why is there never talk of punishing Russia for all of the disputes?\xc2\xa0 Has there ever been a discussion about this?\xc2\xa0 Is this something -- between all of the problems we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the Russians and the United Nations, Ukraine, Syria -- that never comes up?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that just something that\xe2\x80\x99s off the table?\xc2\xa0 Is there any way in dealing with the Russians?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that means.\xc2\xa0 We have a law on the book that deals with accountability in a particular case in Russia, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s broadly the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I terms of Syria, we have made quite clear and quite public our disappointment in the past with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s blocking of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the U.N. Security Council passed unanimously, with full support among the permanent members, including Russia, a resolution with regards to Syria for the first time just the other day.\xc2\xa0 And that is designed to force corridors to be open so that humanitarian aid can flow into Syria, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant step forward.</p>\n<p class="p3">On the matter of Ukraine, we did take action in the realm of banning visas for specific individuals that --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Targeting Ukrainians and targeting Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- who were, in our view, directly responsible for the violence that occurred and the death that occurred.\xc2\xa0 And we remain prepared and have on the table additional sanctions should developments in Ukraine merit that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, targeting Ukraine, not --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure targeting -- it depends on what -- targeting other countries for what action?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if Russia is the one behind propping Yanukovych in this instance --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the sanctions were designed, or the contemplated sanctions were designed and the visa bans were specifically designed in response to acts of violence against innocent and peaceful civilians.\xc2\xa0 The support for a government obviously is a different proposition.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess I go back to this criticism --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I would say is that in the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with President Putin, as we read out, it was our view that President Putin, and Russia generally, agrees with the proposition that we need to see a Ukraine where there is not violence and where stability is returned.\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s interest, and it\xe2\x80\x99s in Europe and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the criticism you\xe2\x80\x99re getting mostly from John McCain but from some others on the tack that the administration is taking with Russia is that it is too passive, too agreeable with Russia, not taking a hard enough line.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that?\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to Senator McCain?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our approach to our relations with Russia has been extremely clear-eyed.\xc2\xa0 It has not been driven by hope or romanticism about what Russia might do, but very specifically driven by what we can get done cooperatively with Russia in some areas, even as make abundantly clear both in public and in private, where we profoundly disagree with Russia.\xc2\xa0 And that approach, as I know the President and Ambassador Rice and Secretary Kerry and others have said, has resulted in tangible benefits for the United States and our national security when it comes to the cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from Russia in resupplying our troops in Afghanistan; when it comes to the joint efforts and cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with Russia on the Security Council; when it comes to Iran.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also been clear in the very clear approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken when we\xe2\x80\x99ve disagreed -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on missile defense or, profoundly, on Syria, or on other matters.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think instead of --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no carrot-and-stick approach here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s almost all carrots with Russia.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s been the stick?\xc2\xa0 The President cancelling his --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that that whole argument is premised on the idea that somehow the fact that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s client state in Syria engulfed in a civil war is good for Russia; or that the government in Ukraine, a large nation on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s border, has been under constant protest by the people of Ukraine and that government obviously was allied with Moscow -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how that can possibly be viewed as good for Russia, or demonstrative of Russia somehow getting the better of the West.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think that, again, is an antiquated view of a dynamic that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist anymore and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening, which is, on the ground in Syria, as horrific as the events there have been, we have seen the Syrian people come out and demonstrate that they want a better future for themselves that does not include a dictator who has been propped up by Moscow, in part, and in the people of Ukraine feeling similarly when it comes to wanting a government that reflects their aspirations and their demands and their hopes for the future, which they were not feeling they were getting from a government that was supported by Moscow.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But yesterday Susan Rice and the President himself last week consistently have said this is not a Cold War, this is not a Cold War chessboard, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going back to the Cold War.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Putin seems to think we\xe2\x80\x99re back in the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 Is he not dealing with this in Cold War mentality?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that he --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you do?\xc2\xa0 I understand what you want to do.\xc2\xa0 What do you do when the other side doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have that conversation?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- whatever others believe -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that we, you or I, can speak for President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s approach and what it\xe2\x80\x99s motivated by.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we called for and the West called for, and most importantly, the Ukrainian people called for a change in Ukraine that included early elections and a constitutional change, and a coalition government, and a government that\xe2\x80\x99s responsive to the wishes of the majority of the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 And obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a very fluid situation there, but we have -- they have, rather -- taken steps to move in that direction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And, again, when it comes to Syria, we make our profound differences with Russia very clear when it comes to Syria, as have our international partners.\xc2\xa0 And where we can cooperate -- when it comes to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s role in getting the Assad regime to admit that it held one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, for example, and committing itself to ridding itself of those weapons, or when it comes to passing the resolution just on Saturday to allow for humanitarian relief to flow to the Syrian people -- again, something that has been blocked by the Assad regime but has now been voted for by all the members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Let me -- Chuck, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to move around here.</p>\n<p class="p2">Margaret.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Could you bring us up to the state of play on the El Chapo situation?\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. made a formal request for extradition?\xc2\xa0 And I know there\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing discussions with the Mexican government, but how important is this to you to be able to do what we need to do through this partner?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered part of your question when it comes to the issues of extradition.\xc2\xa0 As the Department of Justice has said, the decision whether to pursue extradition will be the subject of further discussion between the United States and Mexico, so those conversations are ongoing.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to formally ask unless they\'re going to say yes?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I read a report either yesterday or this morning from a U.S. attorney somewhere saying that the U.S. did want to extradite him.\xc2\xa0 So I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, that this still has to be worked out, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s starting position?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to go through the whole process of a trial in the U.S.?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answers to all of those questions would have to come from the Department of Justice, which handles issues of extradition.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a preference?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a presidential view to read out on this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously appreciative of the fact that Joaquin Guzm\xc3\xa1n Loera, known as \xe2\x80\x9cEl Chapo,\xe2\x80\x9d the alleged leader of the Sinaloa cartel, was captured, and we congratulate the Mexico government on that fact.\xc2\xa0 And this is a significant achievement in our shared fight against transnational organized crime, violence and drug trafficking.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. and Mexico have a strong security partnership, and we will continue to support Mexico in its efforts to ensure that cartel leaders are put out of business.</p>\n<p class="p2">On matters of -- judicial matters and legal matters like extradition, I would just have to refer you to the Department of Justice, except to say that that matter will be the subject of discussions between the U.S. and Mexico.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it all right to say that the U.S. hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet decided, or --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have more of a characterization of our approach, except to tell you that Justice is handling it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you another Eric Holder question then?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been urging Congress to require companies to alert consumers on data breaches, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any more specifics on that.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House or the Justice Department -- or, in concert, the White House and the Justice Department -- are you giving Democrats any guidance on specifics for data breach legislation that you want Congress to pursue?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Defense Secretary is talking today about reducing the size of the army to its lowest level since before World War II.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is, from the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, is this decision to reduce the army fairly dramatically a reflection of budgetary realities, or a belief that the threat environment around the world is at its lowest point since before World War II?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I know as a student of history you understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more complexity to that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the run-up in World War II was quite substantial because we were fighting a two-pronged world war, and then obviously there was a huge increase in forces during Vietnam.</p>\n<p class="p3">The fact, as you said, is that Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey are speaking to the press right now to preview the key decisions they have recommended to the President for the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal year 2015 budget and beyond.\xc2\xa0 Since they are delivering this information, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to discuss details at this stage.\xc2\xa0 But I would just make clear that we appreciate the thoughtful approach they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that will reposition the military after the longest conflict in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, focusing on the strategic challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>\n<p class="p3">For the first time, the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s submission will now specifically show what DOD must do if Congress cannot reach additional compromise on deficit spending and sequestration-level cuts return in fiscal year 2016 and beyond.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon also worked with the White House on a five-year plan that comes in above sequestration but below the President\xe2\x80\x99s submission last year.\xc2\xa0 This plan is responsible, it\xe2\x80\x99s realistic, and it supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s defense strategy.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, again, I urge you to look at what Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey provide today and they\xe2\x80\x99ll have more detail for you after that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President, obviously he has to make a decision, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, on whether or not to accept the recommendations?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are the decisions that they\xe2\x80\x99re recommending to the President as part of his fiscal year 2015 budget and beyond.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that the recommendations fit and represent a responsible, realistic approach to supporting the President\xe2\x80\x99s defense strategy.\xc2\xa0 But for more detail, I would encourage you to wait for the presentation from Secretary Hagel.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can just get I guess to the general principle of a smaller standing army.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, is that, again, drivel largely for budget reasons, or is it because the nature of the threat has changed?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think for defense strategy, I would refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, obviously, is that the President, when he took office, became Commander-In-Chief at a time when we were still fighting two wars -- one in Iraq and one if Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And he pledged during his campaign that he would end both, and he has done that in Iraq and he is doing that in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So obviously, we are in, as the President spoke at length about at National Defense University, in a different footing -- on a different footing, and we were transitioning away from the permanent war footing that we experienced in the wake of the September 11th attacks. \xc2\xa0Obviously, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lessen the fact that we have to maintain extreme vigilance -- and we do -- when it comes to the threats against our nation.\xc2\xa0 And we have to deploy a strategy that is responsive to those threats and anticipates the kinds of conflicts that we are most likely to see in the future.</p>\n<p class="p3">Major, then Chris.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beneath Yanukovych, does the United States government feel it has a functional relationship at the ministerial level with key aspects of what remains of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s government, specifically the military and otherwise?\xc2\xa0 It was made clear to us on Friday that Defense Secretary Hagel finally got through to his defense counterpart.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- over the weekend and in intervening days ahead, is there a concern that absent Yanukovych the entire government itself could fall apart and that could create a power vacuum that any party could exploit or create more turbulence?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think your question reflects the fluidity of the situation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting that President Yanukovych was not the only senior member of his government to pack up and leave Kyiv not long after he had signed an agreement with the opposition that would have created the coalition government that we and many view as still the right approach moving forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So in terms of our interactions with ministries at a lower level, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really speak to that.\xc2\xa0 Our embassy and the State Department I\xe2\x80\x99m sure could.\xc2\xa0 We would note some of the statements that have come out from the defense ministry there, and others, about the approach that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking and the nonviolence that we would like to see there, and the de-escalation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and hope continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But I think your question goes to our insistence or urging that steps be taken very quickly to establish a technocratic unity government that is multiparty in nature so it is reflective of all sectors of Ukraine, and it is focused primarily on stabilizing the country and stabilizing the economic situation in an atmosphere of peace and nonviolence so that that stability can then help the country move forward towards early elections, free and democratic elections, that would result in a government that reflects the will of the majority of the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is one of the fears the administration has that this talk of partition could take on greater significance if, in fact, that technocratic government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take place and a sense of order isn\xe2\x80\x99t established?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when it comes to that question, I would note that we have been very clear that we support an independent and unified Ukraine, and that the idea of separation or partition or division is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people, of the Ukrainian nation, of Europe, or Russia, or the United States.</p>\n<p class="p3">What I think is in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest is a unified Ukraine and a stable Ukraine, and a Ukrainian government that reflects the will of the Ukrainian people and that allows for steps to be taken if the Ukrainian people so desire towards greater integration with Europe, but that, of course, allows also for the historic, cultural, and economic ties that have long been in existence between Ukraine and Russia to continue.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the two should not be seen as contradictory.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Caracas has seen a lot of violence.\xc2\xa0 Twelve people have died.\xc2\xa0 There are protestors in the street.\xc2\xa0 There is no sense that the government is going to fall, but there are issues related to the release of the Leopoldo Lopez and other issues.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Venezuela?\xc2\xa0 And how concerned is it about what it\xe2\x80\x99s seeing playing out in Caracas?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are concerned, and we made clear, that with our OAS and regional partners -- the Organization of American States and our regional partners -- we are working to urge calm and encourage a genuine dialogue among all Venezuelans. As President Obama said in Mexico last week, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against the United States, which the government there has, the Venezuelan government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Another way of putting this is that when President Maduro calls for a dialogue with the U.S. President and an exchange of ambassadors, he should focus instead on the dialogue with the Venezuelan people because that is what is at issue here.\xc2\xa0 This is not about the United States.\xc2\xa0 The government of Venezuela needs to release detained protesters immediately.\xc2\xa0 It also needs to stop impeding the work of independent journalists and restricting information-sharing via television, radio and the Internet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are universal human rights.\xc2\xa0 They are essential to a functioning democracy.\xc2\xa0 And the Venezuelan government has an obligation to protect these fundamental freedoms.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, on Syria, did the U.N. resolution this weekend pave the way for deeper consideration of military action if those corridors are not opened?\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Power said this is not going to happen just by magic; there needs to be compliance.\xc2\xa0 And this is a specific expression of the U.N.\xe2\x80\x99s will and desire for absolute things to happen -- open up those corridors for the humanitarian relief to get in, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a clock ticking on this.\xc2\xa0 Does this pave the way for military action if Syria\xe2\x80\x99s not compliant?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the resolution contains within it not just a commitment by -- not just a requirement that Syria open up access to humanitarian provisions, but a commitment by the Security Council to take action in the event of noncompliance with its demands.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unspecified action, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because this resolution is specific about that, and because the Security Council for the first time committed to take action if there is noncompliance, this resolution is a significant tool.\xc2\xa0 So there are steps along the way, but it is notable that the resulting resolution included within it that commitment, made by all the members who voted for it, which was all the members.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a significant step.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, we obviously hope that the result of the resolution will be Syria\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow for the provision of and free flow of humanitarian assistance to take place because that is our primary interest here.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it doesn\'t, the reading of that resolution is, if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t compliance, the military option now comes more directly into this equation.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the resolution itself contains a commitment by the Security Council to take further action in the event of noncompliance.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say what kind of action.\xc2\xa0 It says nothing about what kind of action.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct, but it does commit the Security Council to take that action.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this administration interpret that as military?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply that say we interpret it as a commitment by all members of the Security Council -- all of them, including the Permanent Five -- to take action if there is noncompliance.\xc2\xa0 Our focus at the moment is on compliance because we hope very much that the resolution and the fact that it passed with unanimous support should --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Assad fear something if he doesn\'t comply?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just point you to the resolution.\xc2\xa0 I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant tool, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the meeting with the governors, Governor Fallin came out to the mics out there at the stakeout and said that the President was within a couple of months of making a decision on the Keystone pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a conversation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that this process is with the State Department.\xc2\xa0 There are steps in that process that have taken place.\xc2\xa0 There are more steps that need to take place in keeping with the kind of timetable that\xe2\x80\x99s been existent in reviews like these for many administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So you know that after the release of -- or the publishing of the environmental impact statement, there\xe2\x80\x99s a period that allows for input from other agencies, input from the public, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the process we\xe2\x80\x99re in now.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything else to add to that, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a conversation to read out.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So by the middle of the year you\xe2\x80\x99ll think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a decision?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable to give to you.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, does the President have a take on this legislation that apparently had been passed but not signed in Arizona that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on the religious beliefs of the business owners?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with the President about that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an official position.\xc2\xa0 It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound particularly tolerant, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a position at this time on it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to the governors -- I should have done the second -- but Governor Jindal, when he came out, there was a bit of a back-and-forth between him and Governor Malloy over the President\xe2\x80\x99s push for a minimum wage increase.\xc2\xa0 And Governor Jindal said that this was basically the President waving the white flag of surrender and trying to create a minimum wage economy.\xc2\xa0 Your response?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw that.\xc2\xa0 The President is trying to create a national economy where the minimum wage is $10.10 an hour.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps Governor Jindal prefers a Governor Jindal economy at $7.25 an hour, but the President certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t; the American people certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Because that wage, a minimum wage that is far behind the times, both economically and otherwise, leaves hardworking Americans who work full-time in poverty.\xc2\xa0 And it is a fundamental principle that this President embraces that if you work full-time, if you work hard, if you are responsible for yourself, if you\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for your family, your reward should not be poverty.\xc2\xa0 It should be a living wage.</p>\n<p class="p3">So that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the President is taking.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that governors across the country have been taking. It\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that millions of Americans, a majority of Americans, by far, support.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that would be good for our middle class and good for our economy.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s phone call with President Putin -- did they have any common ground that they found during that phone call when it came to Ukraine?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what we said, and what I repeated today, is that President Obama and President Putin both agreed that it was in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see the violence deescalate and for stability to be restored in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear, as I was saying earlier, that it is not -- in our view -- in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest or any country\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see continued violence and bloodshed in Ukraine, to see instability in Ukraine. It is not in the West\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not in the interest of the people of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And so we note that there has been a de-escalation in violence, and we note that there has been movement towards a coalition government.\xc2\xa0 There has been constitutional change, there has been movement towards early elections, and those are all positive developments.\xc2\xa0 Now they need to continue on that path and make sure that a transitional government, a unity government that is multi-party and reflects input from all sectors of Ukraine is established so that Ukraine can begin to deal with some of the many challenges it faces.</p>\n<p class="p2">Chris.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, signed today an anti-gay bill that in some cases would penalize homosexual acts with life imprisonment.\xc2\xa0 I saw your statement, but my question is, what details do you have about the impact of signing that bill on U.S.-Uganda relations?\xc2\xa0 The President earlier said signing that bill would complicate the relationship.\xc2\xa0 Will that affect the $400 million a year the United States gives to Uganda in foreign aid?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would point you to our statement, which I believe reflects our strong disagreement with the decision to sign that legislation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad day for Uganda.\xc2\xa0 Instead of standing on the side of freedom, justice, and equal rights for its people, today, regrettably, Ugandan President took Uganda a step backward by signing into law legislation criminalizing homosexuality.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">As President Obama has said, this law is more than an affront and a danger to the gay community in Uganda; it reflects poorly on the country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to protecting the human rights of its people and will undermine public health, including efforts to fight HIV/AIDS.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to urge the government of Uganda to repeal this abhorrent law and to advocate for the protection of the universal human rights of LGBT persons in Uganda and around the world.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you about steps the United States might take in response is that we are undertaking a review of our relationship with Uganda in light of this decision.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will that review come to an end?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will that review be complete?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you, but we are undertaking a review.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And National Security Advisor Susan Rice -- you tweeted out last week I think that she had a conversation with President Museveni about the bill.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, were there any conversations with her and President Museveni?\xc2\xa0 Or between President Obama and President Museveni, either immediately prior to or after the signing of that bill?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that in that conversation, Ambassador Rice made clear our very strong view on this matter, and unfortunately and regrettably the President signed into law this legislation, which has caused the reaction that we gave today.</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes, Wendell.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of different issues, and one on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 A couple of Republicans in the House are calling for hearings or an investigation of problems Maryland and Oregon have had in their implementation of state exchanges for the Affordable Care Act, which they say indicates that federal money was wasted or worse. Do you have any reaction to this?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to that specific report, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d simply say that the administration, HHS and CMS are focused on implementation of the Affordable Care Act, focused on making sure that the exchanges run at the federal level and those run at the state level are functioning effectively on behalf of the millions and millions of Americans who have or want to avail themselves of the opportunity to acquire affordable, quality health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And we have seen, in the wake of the very problematic rollout of healthcare.gov and the fixes made to that website, sustained, substantial interest in making that acquisition -- getting the affordable, quality health insurance that is available now to millions of Americans, many of whom have never had that availability before or haven\xe2\x80\x99t had it for a long time.</p>\n<p class="p3">So that\xe2\x80\x99s our focus.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the states that have run exchanges have had different experiences, many of them very positive.\xc2\xa0 I would note that California I think last week said very, very early in the open enrollment period that they had surpassed their goal in terms of signups.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, there are many other states where implementation has been very effective and robust.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Out at stakeout, there was a fairly sharp exchange between a couple of the governors over the Keystone XL pipeline. I wonder if that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the President\xe2\x80\x99s talks with the governors -- because we don\xe2\x80\x99t see much of opposition on environmental grounds to the Keystone XL Pipeline, but it was very obvious outside.\xc2\xa0 Is that the case in the President\xe2\x80\x99s talks with governors?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President had conversations with governors around a whole host of issues, including the goal of raising the minimum wage nationally, but also the efforts undertaken by states to raise the minimum wage in those states and a whole host of other economic issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think that -- I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific conversation related to the pipeline to read out to you except to say what I said in answer to Jim, that that process continues as it is supposed to over at the --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are you so reluctant to deal with specifics on that when Governor Fallin said very clearly the President promised a decision in a couple of months?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because this process -- first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a private conversation to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you involved in the talks with the governors?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Was I talking with Governor Fallin and --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you listening when the President -- were you in the room when the President was talking?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the room for that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were not?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0-- so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- well, for that conversation I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- and even if I did I don\xe2\x80\x99t read out private conversations that the President has.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is what he would tell you if he was standing --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A private conversation with all the nation\xe2\x80\x99s governors?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re telling me Governor Fallin said that he told her -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This happened at the Q&amp;A.\xc2\xa0 She said it happened at the Q&amp;A.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of that conversation.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get back to us?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout and won\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of that conversation.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that there is a process being run by the State Department -- I know this is very upsetting to Republicans, but it was done this way under Republican administrations, more than one, and it\xe2\x80\x99s being run that way under this administration, which has run --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about the process and I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about what\xe2\x80\x99s upsetting to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I specifically asked you whether or not Democrats have deep environmental concerns about Keystone that they express in talks with the President.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have readouts of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure anybody, Democrat or Republican or independent, who has concerns about Keystone on either issue can and has expressed them publicly to the press.\xc2\xa0 And obviously this is an issue where there are strongly felt opinions on all sides.</p>\n<p class="p2">But what I can tell you is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place that has associated with it some timelines that include a period of 90 days -- up to 90 days where agencies have input and the public has input, and that\'s the process we\xe2\x80\x99re in now.\xc2\xa0 You guys can figure it out from there, and you can figure it out by talking to the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just one other Keystone question in regards to the process.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about the two-month timeline that, again, the Governor mentioned in the context of this large discussion is that obviously a Nebraska court has thrown out the route through Nebraska, and clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time for it to be resolved what route at all would happen in that case.\xc2\xa0 Can you say just broadly speaking how that would affect the review process?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t, because that again would be something that the State Department would have to assess.\xc2\xa0 And obviously a local court decision in a state would be something that -- and its impact on the decision-making process and the review here would have to be assessed by the State Department, which is overseeing the review.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- I don\'t have any insight into the decision or its effect.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Several of the Republican governors not here at the stakeout, but at their own press conference said they complained to the President about how some of the defense cuts were affecting the National Guard.\xc2\xa0 And they said the President was dismissive in some ways of their complaints; said something to the effect -- I think Governor Haley said the President said\xc2\xa0 something to the effect of, well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for spending cuts, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got them.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have a -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out pieces of the conversation the President had with governors, because as these questions themselves demonstrate, there were a lot of issues covered.\xc2\xa0 And there are, when it comes to the defense budget, that\'s being addressed right now by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 And they will have a great deal of detail about the recommendations they\'re making as part of the budgetary process, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about that after the budget comes out.</p>\n<p class="p2">Dan and then April.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up on the Uganda question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been checking through my email trying to find what the reaction was.\xc2\xa0 I know Kerry last year reacted to the Nigeria gay law ban. Was there ever to your memory a review of aid issues for Nigeria after that was --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to refer you to the State Department or USAID.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in President Museveni\xe2\x80\x99s statement, quoted by AP, saying he wishes they would just just leave us alone where the gay law is a concern.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- in light of this decision, the United States will undertake a review of its relationship with Uganda.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any outcomes to predict to you because we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking the review now.</p>\n<p class="p2">April.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on -- I have two topics on Jon and Jared\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 What assurances to the American public and to the military that with this latest round of cuts, this recommendation of cuts, that there will not be vulnerabilities for the American public as well as for the military?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, April, this is being addressed I think in great detail by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman.\xc2\xa0 And upon release of the full budget, there will be a lot of charts and tables and numbers for people to review.\xc2\xa0 But the overall approach taken fits into and reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s defense strategy.\xc2\xa0 For more details, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense, and understanding that when the full budget is released there will be more again at that time.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But since it fits into a strategy, does that mean, do I look into that as saying that there will not be vulnerabilities or there could be some?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the definitive -- will there be vulnerabilities --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the Secretary of Defense is giving a definitive speech about it today.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the other topic, on Uganda, you said that this administration is reassessing its relationship with Uganda. Well, is it reassessing its relationship with the other African nations, many that have bans on homosexuality?\xc2\xa0 There are 31 Sub-Saharan African nations that have -- it\xe2\x80\x99s against the law for same-sex acts in those countries.\xc2\xa0 And you have Senegal and Tanzania, where the President visited, that have bans on homosexuality.\xc2\xa0 And you have Nigeria and Uganda at the topping of that list.\xc2\xa0 So are you guys reassessing your relationships with all of these countries as well?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to refer you to the State Department on how those laws have affected our policy approaches and either led to reviews either underway or completed.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the law in Uganda was signed, and our reaction I think is reflected in the statement we put out and in the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing our relationship with Uganda in light of that decision.</p>\n<p class="p2">Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this is a wonky budgety question that you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer to but -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can try.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is doing an event tomorrow -- \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I usually go to Cheryl for that stuff. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got another one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is doing an event tomorrow to focus on the hubs, and he would like to expand the number of hubs, and will in his budget propose that they include 45 of those he wants to include in the $56 billion of additional spending -- so the rationale for expanding those hubs.\xc2\xa0 Can we find out how much of that $56 billion he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking that is needed -- he would ask Congress for to expand those hubs, so we can build that into our stories?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to it.\xc2\xa0 I think that I appreciate the question about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s event, because President Obama will announce new steps in partnership with the private sector to boost advanced manufacturing, strengthen our capabilities for defense, and attract the types of high-quality jobs that a growing middle class requires.</p>\n<p class="p3">As you know, the President will announce two new manufacturing innovation institutes led by the Department of Defense, supported by a $140-million federal commitment, combined with more than $140 million in non-federal resources.\xc2\xa0 Number one, a Detroit-area headquarter consortium of businesses and universities, with a focus on light-weight and modern metals manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 And two, a Chicago headquarter consortium of businesses and universities that will concentrate on digital manufacturing and design technologies.</p>\n<p class="p3">Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is another step forward towards fulfilling the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for a full national network, which you mention, of up to 45 manufacturing innovation institutes, which will also require legislation from Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to work with Congress to get legislation passed while also continuing to make progress where he can to put boost these partnerships that are important to revitalizing our manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you maybe by tomorrow --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have given some preview, but on the specifics of the budget -- the budget is coming out in just a couple of weeks -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to pore over that in a race with Cheryl to get all the details into print.</p>\n<p class="p3">Cheryl, what do you have?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try another little one, which you may or may not know.\xc2\xa0 But the President today -- been talking about his budget to the Governor, said that he was going to be proposing a new way to pay for -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly how this works -- wildfire suppression.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more details on that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting on it, but I can tell you this:\xc2\xa0 Population growth near forest and rangelands, past management practices and a change in climate have dramatically increased wildfire risk and the resulting cost. Unfortunately, the current way that the government pays for fire suppression and preparedness costs is ill-suited to the increasing severity and cost of fires.</p>\n<p class="p2">In recent years, including both of the last two years, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior have been forced to rely on short-sighted transfers from non-suppression programs in order to fund excess fire suppression activities.\xc2\xa0 What that means is this undermines other important functions, including critical forest management and fire risk reduction activities.\xc2\xa0 In other words, you\xe2\x80\x99re taking from funding that would help manage forests and reduce fires in the future in order to suppress existing fires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So the President is calling for a fundamental change in how wildfire suppression is funded.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will support bipartisan congressional proposals to treat suppression of the most severe fire activity, including large fires that require emergency response, are near urban areas, or for abnormally active fire seasons as extraordinary costs that would be funded outside the discretionary budget caps much like we fund response to other natural disasters.\xc2\xa0 So the answer is, yes, he is looking at a whole new way of making sure that we have the funding necessary to deal with these major fires.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay, is that what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about with the western governors today?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion about drought in general.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s specific to that.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t2:24 P.M.
