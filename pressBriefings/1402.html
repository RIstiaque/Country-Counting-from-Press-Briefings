<h1>Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 2/23/10</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:40 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Two quick announcements before we take your questions here.\xc2\xa0 The President and First Lady will welcome President Sarkozy of France to the White House on Tuesday, March 30th, for a meeting and a private dinner.\xc2\xa0 France is an invaluable partner and ally of the United States in our shared efforts to promote peace, security and prosperity around the world.\xc2\xa0 And the French and the American people share deep cultural and historic ties.</p>\n<p>The President looks forward to consulting with President Sarkozy on a broad range of strategic issues of mutual concern, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran, Middle East peace efforts, European security cooperation, and sustaining global economy recovery.</p>\n<p>Secondly, today the President announced the administration\xe2\x80\x99s strong support for repealing the antitrust exemption currently enjoyed by health insurers.\xc2\xa0 At its core, health reform is all about ensuring that American families and businesses have more choices, benefit from more competition, and have greater control over their own health care.\xc2\xa0 Repealing this exemption is an important part of that effort.</p>\n<p>Today there are no rules outlawing bid rigging, price fixing, and other insurance company practices that will drive up health care costs, and often drive up their own profits as well.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nThat was transmitted to Congress in a statement of administration policy as the House considers that legislation over the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a lot of members of your own party on the Hill are wondering how aggressive the President is going to get in selling this latest, last-ditch effort at comprehensive reform.\xc2\xa0 So what are his plans?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to talk to the public?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear him talking frequently about the need to do this?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of rollout campaign for his plan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m not going to get too far ahead of the next thing that\'s on the calendar, and that\'s the importance of \xe2\x80\x93 important events of Thursday in \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats are saying that this kind of an effort would be just as important as sitting down around the table.\xc2\xa0 You also have to sell it to a public that\xe2\x80\x99s skeptical and to Democrats on the Hill who are skeptical.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but I think before we get there the President has wanted to and will sit down with Democrats and Republicans to discuss their ideas, to go through the plans that had been put forward and to find agreement where that\'s possible. I think that\'s the next step, and I don\'t think the President wants to get too far ahead on that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how are they -- I don\'t see how they have to be separate from one another.\xc2\xa0 Why do you have to separate one out from the other?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not discussing whether or not they\'re separate.\xc2\xa0 The President is not focused on Friday.\xc2\xa0 The President ultimately is focused on Thursday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Democrats are saying he needs to be focused on Friday if there\'s any chance of this thing succeeding.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been focused on getting health care reform this far.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on getting it done.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to what we hope is a robust exchange of ideas on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hate to drag this out even further, but it sounds like what you\'re -- it sounds like you\'re not willing to say that he\'s going to make an aggressive sales effort --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You want to take this in a different direction. The President is focused -- the President is focused on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting gears a little bit, can you talk about where things stand with the Volcker rule?\xc2\xa0 It\'s being watered down by lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 Treasury put out a statement today talking about wanting limits for banks on proprietary trading.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s original announcement was an outright ban, and that\'s what Chairman Volcker supports.\xc2\xa0 Are you softening your position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 The administration remains as committed today to what was outlined that day with Chairman Volcker and members of the economic team.\xc2\xa0 We\'re as committed to that now as we were on that day.\xc2\xa0 This was a proposal that was developed by -- at the President\'s behest with Chairman Volcker, with Secretary Geithner and with Director Summers, and outlined and announced by the President with all three at his side.\xc2\xa0 We have -- we\'re not walking away from and we\'re not watering down that proposal one bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you signaling that you\'d be willing to accept less than what the President initially --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re as committed to what the President outlined that day.\xc2\xa0 We\'re as committed to that now as we were on that day.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not walking away from what the President outlined on the Volcker rule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve taken a pretty strong stand on the consumer agency.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel as strongly about the Volcker rule as that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other question.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about tonight\'s dinner with the business leaders?\xc2\xa0 What does the President want to talk to them about?\xc2\xa0 And what is he going to talk about tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the international tax provisions, but what other topics --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was asked that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President will outline a vision for a more competitive America.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to sitting down with executive community members from the Business Roundtable this evening and having a free-flowing conversation about their ideas -- we\'ll have -- I think we\'ve put out some of those names, we\'ll put out the remainder of those names at the beginning of the dinner -- to discuss where the interests of workers, business and government intersect in creating a new foundation for ensuring incentives for continued hiring; to talk about the need to export more of our goods overseas and open up markets; to discuss the steps that we\'ve taken to stabilize the economy and the financial system; and discuss what his vision is moving forward.\xc2\xa0 So I think that will all be what he outlines tomorrow at the speech.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit more about this statement of administration policy regarding the antitrust exemption?\xc2\xa0 Why specifically now?\xc2\xa0 How long has the President been planning on coming out in favor of this?\xc2\xa0 He\'s been hinting about it for quite some time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the House is considering in their legislative vehicle -- this legislation goes to the Rules Committee today; as my understanding, goes to the floor either tomorrow or the day after that.\xc2\xa0 We typically weigh in at this part -- point in the process with a statement of administration policy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been evaluated by a number of departments throughout government, and believe that this -- removing this exemption will allow appropriate enforcement and examination of potential policies that might prove uncompetitive, might stifle competition, and we think this better promotes affordability and innovation through greater choice and less market concentration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it was either a few weeks ago or a few months ago the President said, I think in one of the weekly addresses, that it was time for Congress to consider repealing the antitrust exemption.\xc2\xa0 Do you have evidence that there is any, as you put it, bid rigging or price fixing?\xc2\xa0 Is that why he came out more solidly in favor of this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We do know this, Jake, that the AMA studied the market concentration of health insurers and found that 94 percent of the U.S. health insurance markets were highly concentrated, meaning one or only a few health insurers offering policies in, as I said, almost all the markets in the country.\xc2\xa0 This allows DOJ and FTC the ability to look into, in complement with state insurance regulations, to ensure competitiveness.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And about Thursday\'s summit, it doesn\'t really seem like it\'s shaping up right now to seem all that bipartisan on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 You have Republicans saying it\'s going to be a Democratic infomercial.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the President posted his plan on whitehouse.gov is indicative of a lack of sincerity on his part, they say, because he\'s -- and then, for your guy\'s part, the bill that you\'ve posted is not just a bill the President supports; it\'s also a vehicle to get this through Congress without any Republican support.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jake, the bill is a starting point for what Congress had spent many months considering.\xc2\xa0 What we get out of Thursday will be, as I said yesterday, based on the willingness of those participating to come in with an open mind and discuss the ideas and the plans that they have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Was it disappointing that Senate Republicans appear to have decided not to post their plan on the Internet for discussion, or for Republicans to come with a more consensus plan?\xc2\xa0 Sure, that\'s disappointing.\xc2\xa0 I hope that doesn\'t wipe away their willingness to actively discuss the ideas that they have to cut costs for those that are drowning -- small businesses and families -- government budgets, and those that are being discriminated against by the practices of insurance companies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99ve posted it in the form that you\xe2\x80\x99ve posted it, which is not just a list of principles or a statement of legislation \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but, I mean, look, we all know that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 In fairness --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for reconciliation if it comes to that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, in fairness, I can assume if we would have simply posted principles they would have said, why isn\'t there more information?</p>\n<p>Look, semantics aside, the President looks forward to discussing actively for several hours with members of his administration, Democrats and Republicans, their ideas for health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I can\'t stress enough, I think the product, the output of six hours of discussion will be based on every participant\'s willingness to come and have an honest and frank discussion.</p>\n<p>I don\'t think it does any good if somebody says, we\'re not going there to offer our ideas, we\'re just going there to help people understand how bad the other guys\' ideas are.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what the American people are looking for.\xc2\xa0 They\'re looking for Democrats and Republicans who are willing to sit around a table and work together to provide solutions to problems like health care, the rising cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President sees as his hope for what happens on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Jeff Sestak last week said that the White House offered him a high ranking job in the administration to not run against Arlen Specter.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was traveling for a couple of days, as you know.\xc2\xa0 I have seen some stuff that he said, but I have not looked into this.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Jake\'s question, is the White House optimistic that on Friday health care will be in a different place than it is right now, that something will actually --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hopefully Thursday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President wants to sit down and discuss ways to move forward, ideas of common interest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- from Republicans are you confident, are you optimistic that this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am, because, look, I think this is -- you always have a little bit of pre-game chatter.\xc2\xa0 I think the -- again, the willingness of individuals and groups to discuss these ideas I think will change when the -- I think the American people want to see that two parties can sit around a table and coherently discuss solutions to the problems that the American people face.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the American people want to see as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday after the jobs bill, the Republicans supporting the jobs bill, did the President directly reach out to them, thank them for --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President made any calls. Obviously you saw our statement.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think this is a good example and a good lead-in to Thursday, and that is there\'s a willingness for members to put aside partisan games and to move ahead with what we know is important for the American people and for the growth and the stabilization of our economy.</p>\n<p>My sense is that this will pass fairly overwhelmingly either later today or tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s an important step on the road to each party working together on solutions for the American people.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the health care, supporters of the public option are making another push in preparation for Thursday\'s meeting to try to get it back on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 By not including it in the President\'s proposal, is the President saying as far as he\'s concerned it\'s dead?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that we have seen obviously -- and I talked about this some yesterday -- that there are some that are supportive of this.\xc2\xa0 There isn\'t enough political support in a majority to get this through.\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to find -- took the Senate bill as a base, and looks forward to discussing consensus ideas on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question that I -- on Wall Street bonuses.\xc2\xa0 The New York State Comptroller just released its report for 2009.\xc2\xa0 It says pay was up 17 percent over 2008.\xc2\xa0 The average taxable bonus on Wall Street rose to $123,850, and pay was probably even higher than that because it didn\'t include deferred compensation or stock options.\xc2\xa0 First of all, any comment from the administration that has at least talked a lot and done some hard work to try to get these bonuses to go down instead of up?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, is the White House satisfied with regulators in Congress and what they\'re doing to curb these bonuses?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, obviously you\'ve heard the President on a number of occasions voice his frustration and outright shock at the pay practices of Wall Street at a time in which the American people were rushing directly to their financial aid to prevent a further collapse of the economy.</p>\n<p>The President in the Recovery Act appointed Ken Feinberg to review the bonus and compensation structure of firms that had received extraordinary governmental assistance, and he\'s pleased with the efforts that Ken has made thus far.\xc2\xa0 We pushed for in the House a provision providing shareholders with a say on executive pay that did pass the House and is certainly pending in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the President has long advocated that in lieu of cash, any bonus that is given ought to be given in long-term stock that does not, again, reward short-term risk taking, but rewards long-term success.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen some progress on that front.\xc2\xa0 But, Chip, I think it\'s safe to say that the President remains frustrated and believes that the compensation practices of Wall Street have a long way to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And despite all his efforts it seems that they just kind of shrug off the criticism.\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\'t there something beyond frustration?\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t there more he can do here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, look, we have instituted important rules for the firms that directly received extraordinary assistance to keep them afloat.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people are equally outraged and shocked by what appears to be a carelessness about the way the people of this country -- a carelessness about the way the people of this country loaned Wall Street money to ensure it didn\'t collapse, all while Wall Street appears not to hear the outrage and the frustration each day on the pay practices that we\'ve seen thus far.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the CBO says it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough information on this new health care plan to score it.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to provide that info so it\'s scored before tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The plan wasn\xe2\x80\x99t put up in order to score it before tomorrow, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you guys wanted the -- what is going on? Yesterday --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- do you still want to have the CBO there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There were folks that mentioned that might be uncomfortable for \xe2\x80\x93- congressional leaders that mentioned that might be uncomfortable for CBO based on executive and congressional -- I think we\'ll have access to OMB.\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say we have a rough sense of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- said don\'t bring the CBO?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into that.\xc2\xa0 The proposal that the President put online, again, is a starting point.\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that we ever believed would be a proposal that would be fully scored.\xc2\xa0 Our hope is that we can add some ideas for a broader-consensus legislation that could go to CBO.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you plan on getting it fully scored?\xc2\xa0 Do you guys plan on asking the Congressional Budget Office to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not before Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but after Thursday, what you come up with -- because it\'s never going to be a full bill, I understand that, because you still have the Senate bill on one hand and the fixes on the other hand.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get past where we\'re going on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday on the job\'s bill, you guys had endorsed one bill, then it got yanked and Reid put out this very -- this smaller $15 billion bill.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to see the Senate do a series of these now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we said that then.\xc2\xa0 We said that -- I mean, for instance, we\'ve --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you guys want to see the Senate tackle next?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you\'ll see -- what I know has to happen by the end of the month, obviously, is an extension of long-term unemployment benefits and an extension of health care and COBRA benefits that many would see expire at the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are additional tax ideas, and the President outlined a series of small business ideas that he hopes that the Senate will take up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one in this --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we said then and it\'s certainly true now that legislation making its way through the Senate will -- this legislation that they\'re now considering will not be the first -- oh, I\'m sorry, is the first but won\'t be the last proposal that the Senate will likely take up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is turning out to be a better way to get through -- things through the Senate, these small chunks?\xc2\xa0 Or just --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is encouraging that you had bipartisan support yesterday for moving these ideas forward for debate.\xc2\xa0 My prediction is that you will have -- this is something that despite the threat of -- the threat of filibuster and the need to end that threat, my guess is you\'ll have pretty broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 What that means is -- again, I think there\'s -- I think the American people want to see us end the game play. I\'ll let each individual member decide how they want to respond to a constituent who says, why did you oppose moving forward with it on Monday and support it on Wednesday or Thursday?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, again, I think there are -- many of these -- there will be several avenues which to take up ideas in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important that we get them done quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quick clarification on the Republican health care. Do you guys not -- the House Republicans yesterday responded to your comment saying that they didn\'t have a health care plan saying, hey, no, we have a health care plan.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I was talking about was a consensus -- were consensus ideas -- was a consensus set of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t believe the House Republican plan is the consensus Republican plan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if -- I will assume, in lieu of Mitch McConnell posting a plan, that Mitch McConnell is quite pleased with Congressman Boehner\'s plan.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll assume that the plan that the House Republicans have speaks for the Senate Republicans in lieu of the Senate Republicans themselves posting their ideas.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you make of the characterizations of Thursday as "last best hope," "last ditch" on health care reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it is -- I think this is an important avenue for each party to get together and seek consensus.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s easier to fire away at each other when you\'re not in the same room and you\'re not having to sit down and talk to each other.\xc2\xa0 So I think this provides an important avenue for us, for members of Congress, and, quite frankly, for the American people to see us work together, and I think that\'s what the President hopes to see on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the last avenue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what can you tell us about the negotiations -- or are there negotiations -- on format, on table size, on cameras?\xc2\xa0 Who\'s making the calls on this?\xc2\xa0 It almost sounds like a G8 summit negotiation with sherpas or something.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I have -- you know, I can\'t imagine that we couldn\'t find a few tables to put together and somebody can write out some rudimentary name cards and we can all find places to sit.\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean, I -- you know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the House being --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is it being characterized as something far more complex than that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seems like it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the shape of the table has changed --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, if the biggest thing that we debate on Thursday is the shape of the table, then I could understand the utter disgust and contempt that the American people might have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chalkboard or PowerPoint?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the American people will see that we can get past discussing -- I don\'t know who\'s discussing the size and the shape of the table.\xc2\xa0 I think that is somewhat immaterial to the solutions that will be discussed.\xc2\xa0 The President is not -- the President is interested in having a balanced conversation and hearing from Republicans and Democrats. I don\'t know what the shape of the table was in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 That seemed to be a process that worked quite well for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was a table.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There wasn\'t a table.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we\'ll just -- you know, maybe those little desks they give you in like elementary school that would otherwise be uncomfortable and hard to fit into might be the best way forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a lunch break?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe no desks, no chairs?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Recess?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, just sitting on the floor and figuring it all out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Crisscross, apple sauce?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can the White House point to any evidence for its optimism that this ball -- health care ball is going to get moved by the end of Thursday?\xc2\xa0 And what would that be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I can\'t prejudge what happens on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I take any member that wants to come and have an honest discussion -- you take them at their word that that\'s what they want to do.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get a chance to see the motivations behind any participation on Thursday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I sent this out Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I think many of you all saw that the Republican ideas that are included in the President\'s proposal -- the President is open to discussion on issues relating to cost and insurance reforms to how we save money for the federal government as it relates to our deficit, and to improving -- to coverage.\xc2\xa0 So those are roughly -- to get back to some of the formatting questions, there will be discussions on each of the four of those things as the President -- or as the administration outlined in their letter to Congress that I think we\'ll spend a good amount of time discussing.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the President is looking forward to hearing from members and having an honest discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President buy into the conventional wisdom that with each passing day, as the midterm elections come around, doing some heavy lifting like this health care legislation becomes harder?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously I think when we get later into the summer that\'s probably likely the case.\xc2\xa0 But I think we understand that there\'s a number of things that we have on our plate that are going to have to get done before -- and what the President wants to see get done before those elections in November, including not just health care but continued effort on jobs and employment, financial reform, and other important things that have to get done between now and November.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no deadline for congressional -- and on the antitrust exemption, does the President think that that can be a stand-alone action that takes care of some of the health insurance problems, or does it have to be a part of the larger package?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think this certainly complements what -- this will ultimately complement health care reform in ensuring the changes that you make in the market -- that the ability to look into potential anti-competitive practices, that that\'s not, quite frankly, illegal to do.\xc2\xa0 This is not in lieu of something to make broader changes in the insurance market.\xc2\xa0 This is a complementary step along the way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, as I understand it, the participants are going to have lunch on site on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Does the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what they\'re going to eat.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- planning to join them?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something healthy.\xc2\xa0 A box lunch?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be in a bag?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there was some discussion of a box lunch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President participate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, is he staying the whole time or is he dipping in and dipping out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The whole time?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\'d like to give you a chance to respond to a couple things that House Republicans said today.\xc2\xa0 First, Eric Cantor, quoting him directly, "They say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing and expect a different result.\xc2\xa0 And the President clearly seems to be trying to prove that that is true."\xc2\xa0 That\'s Eric Cantor.\xc2\xa0 John Boehner, regarding the President:\xc2\xa0 "He has basically crippled the summit that\'s expected on Thursday by coming in with a rerun of the same failed bill that couldn\'t pass the House or the Senate."\xc2\xa0 Could you respond to those two --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the bill passed -- one bill actually did pass the House and one bill actually did pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- in many ways a consensus plan around those ideas.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, as I likened a minute ago, you can put your -- tape your quotes up on the locker room wall and put on your --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s locker room material?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s -- you hit my shoulder pads, I\'ll hit yours, and we\'ll go running off through the tunnel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s on the same team, though, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 They\'re all going to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Among themselves?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I see.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I lost you on the football analogy, didn\'t I?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It was very clear up here, Major, it just apparently didn\'t get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s mourning LT.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So I read.\xc2\xa0 But, again, look, we can play games about the President\'s proposal --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\'re just trying to hype themselves up in anticipation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- if the President hadn\'t put anything on there, wouldn\'t you guess, Major, that we would hear, well, is the President not bringing any ideas to the summit?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are we not going to -- do we not have a document with which we\'re working on to start this proposal?\xc2\xa0 Of course you would have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that no matter what you did, Republicans will criticize?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, it is hard to say -- I will say this, it is hard to take into -- it is hard to listen to, on one hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\'t believe they\'re prejudging the outcome of this by laying out a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d and then in the next breath saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan doesn\'t have enough detail to be scored by the CBO.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How do you rationalize -- I don\'t know how they rationalize it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s probably taped up somewhere in the locker room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s irrational.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It appears to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President came here about a week and a half ago, he said that what shouldn\'t happen is this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t all go back to the congressional committees for rewrites, the health care legislation.\xc2\xa0 So what I\'m curious about is, let\'s just say for the sake of argument something miraculous happens Thursday and you get something that\'s akin to a deal.\xc2\xa0 Who writes it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does it go back to committee?\xc2\xa0 Do you go straight to the House floor, the Senate floor?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these kinds of things are not insignificant to achieving a health care result.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, they\'re not insignificant, but I\'ll be honest with you, Major, leaving the table and the lunch structure aside, I think if we come out of there with an agreement on some ideas --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which you would probably concede would be near miraculous.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to prejudge the outcome based on people\'s willingness to come in there with an open mind.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think the largest impediment to getting something done is, is does the Legislative Counsel for the Ways and Means Committee write down our final ideas or do we send it to larger -- I think those are -- well, again, once we get past the size of the table, I think we can come to -- I think we can come to an agreement and an understanding of that.\xc2\xa0 I think what we lack right now appears to be, based on some of the quotes that you just read me, is a willingness to come and discuss these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me give you a chance to answer a question on the minds of some progressives.\xc2\xa0 If you are open to the idea of reconciliation, why not put public option in it and go all the way?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President simply believes that we ought to have an up or down vote on health care.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to get into the structure of how things would look.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on what he hopes will be a productive conversation on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Jake\'s question, because on Friday, unnamed officials of this building did vociferously deny Representative Sestak\'s assessment that he had been offered a job.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to say, when you said, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\'t looked at this,\xe2\x80\x9d I want to make sure you\'re not contradicting that denial.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just -- because I was on the road and dealing with different things on the road, I\'ve not had a chance to delve into this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would there be anything inappropriate about a discussion like that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me have somebody look into -- like I said, I was on the road and I don\'t really have a whole lot of knowledge on this.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on the -- not to prolong the table/boxed lunch questions, but the President will be out on national television for hours and hours and hours.\xc2\xa0 Usually, when a President goes out that long, there is some sort of preparation for that.\xc2\xa0 Is there any kind of rehearsal or discussion or briefing or any kind of practice?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, he and Nancy-Ann have gone through ideas and proposals.\xc2\xa0 He\'s gotten a longer memo on what ideas are out there and -- in hopes of, again, finding some common agreement on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you do any kind of mock session in which somebody would say, "Sir, somebody might ask you -- what would you respond?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to say that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any structure like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whatever it was, please say it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question just to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, I\'m sorry, I\'m sorry --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last one, sorry.\xc2\xa0 On the President\'s exemption part, a lot of Democrats would like that to be in the bill you posted yesterday, and yet it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 Why support it separately and not as part of it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this was going through a House process.\xc2\xa0 We had certainly known for I don\'t know how long, but we\'ve known that this was going to Rules Committee today.\xc2\xa0 Typically the administration weighs in with a statement on administration policy at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- propose it yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, I think it\'s -- I think there\'s a belief that we can get a bipartisan majority that can support ensuring that type of competition without putting it into legislation.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow up on Jennifer\'s question, when you first got your plan the leadership in Congress was fairly non-committal.\xc2\xa0 They said they wanted to take a look at it and discuss it with their members.\xc2\xa0 Now it\'s been more than 48 hours. What in the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, not 48.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, 24.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What indication do you have that at least in the House of Representatives there is support for -- majority support for this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t want to get ahead of announcing for them where all of their members are.\xc2\xa0 I know they\'re -- as I understand it, they\'re going to have a caucus today to discuss some of these ideas, and they also met last night, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\'t gotten any feedback in the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I got to tell you, I thought the statements yesterday by a number of members were indeed quite positive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this could pass the House of Representatives?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a vote counter on Capitol Hill, but I do believe that this represents among Democratic ideas a good starting point based on where the Senate was, with some tweaks in that legislation.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a starting point for our discussions on Thursday that we hope will be fruitful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it go to Congress after that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, don\'t you want them to do something with it, even if there\'s not some kind of bipartisan miracle?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'re --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I know it\'s only Tuesday and I\'m focused on Thursday and we want to look beyond Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I\'m focused on Thursday; I know that\'s where the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 Our intention is to have an honest discussion and hopefully find continued support for ideas on both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about your side of the aisle.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s -- again, there\'s a willingness to want to get well ahead of the process.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, the bill wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sent to CBO to get scored because our hope is that we\'re going to add ideas from both sides of the aisle that have common support.\xc2\xa0 I think there are overlaps if people come with a willingness to make progress on an issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try another way.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Have you had conversations with Democrats since you put this thing online?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\'ve briefed Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s been the response?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- Mara, you guys are normally quite good at getting quotes from them.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen many positive quotes on this.\xc2\xa0 Again, our focus is not on what happens Friday, next week, two weeks from now or what have you.\xc2\xa0 Our focus is on a starting point --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has to be, Robert --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House does not sit still and wait for Friday to come before --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t you want to pass a bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re doing this on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, if this is an urgent need for the American public to address all sorts of things -- economic, regulatory and everything else, all the things you have said a hundred times if not more from this podium -- how could you not be thinking past Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I\'m not going to prejudge the outcome of Thursday by telling you what\'s going to happen Friday based on an outcome of Thursday that I don\'t know about, based on the fact that I think the willingness -- or the product that ultimately comes out of 4:00 o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Thursday will be based on people\'s willingness to come with an open mindset.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not to say you don\'t have contingency plans?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m focused on Thursday; the White House is focused on Thursday; the President is focused on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 As luck would have it, you all probably have a chance to ask me questions on Friday, and we can get to Friday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Leg Affairs might be focused on a different day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan A, plan B, plan C, possibly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan A, plan B, plan C, possibly?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What if nothing comes out of Thursday that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Then you could ask me that on Friday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All evidence out there points to them showing up and not wanting to make this deal.\xc2\xa0 But is it not na\xc3\xafve to think that -- if your overall goal --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but it just seems na\xc3\xafve to think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say this?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I get one question that says, I can\'t believe by putting out a plan you\'ve completely prejudged and corrupted and polluted the process of what\'s going to happen on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 So if I then start describing what\'s going to happen on Friday, based on what may happen on Thursday, aren\'t you going to certainly -- aren\'t certainly people going to come back and say you\'ve already prejudged the outcome of Thursday by discussing what\'s going to happen on Friday?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, we\'re not asking you about Friday.\xc2\xa0 We\'re asking you if you feel confident that you will have Democratic support for this plan today or tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have discussed this plan with Democrats.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\'re evaluating parts of the legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said -- there was a bill that passed the House and a bill that passed the Senate, but if I understood your answer to Mara correctly --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I said that -- apparently I said that to Congressman Boehner, who didn\'t think that happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if I understand your answer to Mara, you can\'t say now if this proposal of the President could even pass the House, which is the first step to getting a bill --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I said I wasn\'t a vote counter and I don\'t have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have some confidence it could pass the House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have confidence that, based on the quotes that I\'ve seen, this has been received warmly by Democrats on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 39 Democrats who voted no for the House health care bill back in November indicated that they\'d vote yes the next go-round?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 One of you ask a question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll go first.\xc2\xa0 This is health care-related, but going back to August, just clarifying some Sunday talk show chatter --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess -- yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the resistance is to talking about now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the -- "the President\'s clear commitment is not to raise taxes on those making less than $250,000 a year.\xe2\x80\x9d The President\'s proposal out yesterday actually would raise the Medicare payroll or hospital insurance tax on households making less than $250,000.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look through the proposal.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Excuse me.\xc2\xa0 This morning Governor Daniels of Indiana was asked about reconciliation which comes up with regulatory here, and he said that when the tax cuts were passed in the previous administration, where he served as OMB director, it was meant to be applied only to taxes and budget matters, but never to matters such as revolutionary changes in policy that would affect 16 percent of the government -- or 16 percent of the economy.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How much does -- $1.35 trillion worth of tax cuts in 2001, $350 billion in tax cuts in 2003 -- for $1.65 trillion in tax cuts over two votes, is what measure of -- that\'s a price tag that exceeds what the President is talking about.\xc2\xa0 And differently than that, the proposal that the President has is indeed paid for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I knew there was a "but" in there.\xc2\xa0 I just had to get my broader --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 It did deal with tax and budget matters, which under --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- which was with reconciliation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Welfare was another example of something that had passed based on reconciliation. I can certainly get a list of, I think many of you can get a list of, ideas that have gone through the process of that that up until recently didn\'t seem to be abnormal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After you gave 13 questions to one reporter, I just have --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who asked 13 questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- one two-parter.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One two-parter.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I like your new packaging, Lester.\xc2\xa0 Who asked 13 questions, though?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 FOX.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wow, that\'s awkward, isn\'t it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- even ask your question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, all right, easy.\xc2\xa0 This locker room talk is getting a little out of hand, isn\'t it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You started it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, I did.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll come over there, Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The nonpartisan, nonprofit Judicial Watch has named Nevada\'s Republican Senator John Ensign as one of Washington\'s 10 most corrupt politicians for 2009.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen Judicial Watch\'s list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They also named the President as one of these.\xc2\xa0 I presume you don\'t agree with that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no basis for which they would come up with something like that.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen their 2009 report.</p>\n<p>April, and then Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one on the public option.\xc2\xa0 You say that it\'s not in this, but are there any components of the public option that will be taken and transplanted into this proposal that the President has for Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a debate that was largely ended with the notion that it\'s not going to make it through the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 The proposal that the President put online was where he believed was a good starting point at the end of the debate that had been had on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 We think that the way exchanges are structured and other components of the legislation will increase the amount of choice and competition that people have in picking health insurance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on another question, Democrats concerned about the fact that this administration -- they are just not listening to what constituents have to say, and also amongst ranks.\xc2\xa0 You have people like Ed Rendell, governor of Pennsylvania, you also have Doug Wilder, former governor of Virginia, former mayor of Richmond.\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts about the issues of listening, about the fact that people are saying, in your own party, that this administration is just not listening?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On strategic -- on strategic avenues to include how to campaign for the upcoming election, midterms, as well as just the top echelon here, some of the reasons why things -- including Massachusetts -- were lost; this administration is just not listening to people on the ground, to fellow Democrats about what to do next.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m sure people\'s advice on the November elections -- there will certainly be plenty of time to listen to anybody\'s advice on the November elections, since we\'re only comfortably in mid-February.</p>\n<p>The President\'s focus isn\'t on the elections in November; it\'s on getting this economy started again, on passing comprehensive health care reform, on prosecuting a war in Iraq and a war in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this administration has a good track record on listening to its own party?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But I also know that the President has a good track record on making decisions that he believes are in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if you look back at some of the decisions that were made in terms of continuing support for helping banks that might collapse, or helping auto companies that were near bankruptcy, I don\'t imagine that there were majorities of Democrats or Republicans that might have thought that was a good idea or something that they readily supported.\xc2\xa0 But understanding that without taking some extraordinary steps to deal with that, we would have had tens of thousands of more people unemployed in the case of auto companies; we\'d have -- we wouldn\'t have a domestic auto industry except for one company; and it\'s likely that had we seen additional bank failures, we would have seen what many have called a Great Recession become a Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Governing a country isn\xe2\x80\x99t always about making the easiest, most popular decisions.\xc2\xa0 Governor Rendell talked about the selling of the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 The stimulus plan was about ensuring that we got the type of support that the economy needed into the economy as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any doubt that the polling on the stimulus might be different if instead of doing it in three weeks and getting the money quickly into the economy so that we could see people put back to work and see economic growth happen faster -- I have no doubt that we could have taken eight months, fueled up Air Force One, flown hither and yon and broken out each component part to where it was 80 percent and ultimately gotten Congress to pass that.\xc2\xa0 The problem with that is I don\'t think the President believed that when we were losing close to 800,000 jobs in a month, that his biggest job was PR.\xc2\xa0 I think it was getting the economy moving again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ve seen as a result of that increased economic growth for the first time in a year, and now we\'ve seen it for two consecutive quarters.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t have job growth before we have economic growth.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve laid a foundation, particularly in the investments that have been made, for creating the jobs of the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But PR is part of it, don\'t you think?\xc2\xa0 Especially serving your own party.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- trust me, as somebody who\'s somebody who\'s somewhat intimately involved in the PR part of the operation, it\'s not the first and foremost thing that gets this President up in the morning.\xc2\xa0 What gets him up is taking the steps that are necessary to fix this economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously explaining to the American people what we\'re doing is important and I don\'t want to give that short shrift.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, if it\'s explaining to the American people what\'s\xc2\xa0 -- explaining to them what\'s going on, as I said, is important, but so, too, in the case of getting this economy stabilized and moving again, it was important to get that done and get that done quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Connie.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take one more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s becoming more precarious every day with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States have a deadline for the sanctions proposed?\xc2\xa0 And would the U.S. impose a unilateral boycott or embargo of Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Treasury Department outlined additional sanctions on the IRGC a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 It is clear that the continuing announcements and pronouncements that are made in Iran demonstrate that they have no interest in building international confidence that their nuclear program is for peaceful means.</p>\n<p>Continuing to take those steps and shirk their responsibilities, the President and our allies have said will lead to consequences.\xc2\xa0 That is a process that\'s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve seen comments by -- you\'ve certainly seen comments by us, you\'ve seen comments by the Russians and others about the fact that time and patience is running out.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:30 P.M.
