EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One on what appears to be Caren Bohan\'s final trip as a White House correspondent for Reuters.\xc2\xa0 We will miss you.\xc2\xa0 More to come on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as you know, is heading to California, where he\'ll have several campaign events today and this evening, and tomorrow will go to Nevada, where he will have an official event to talk about the urgent need to take steps to improve college affordability because there is a direct link between economic growth and education.\xc2\xa0 And that is the case he will make tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President have any reaction to the Wisconsin vote last night?\xc2\xa0 And what does he think it says about the mindset of voters right now and his own prospects in Wisconsin in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a conversation with the President about Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 I think my observation is that what you had was an incumbent governor in a repeat election that he had won once, in which he outspent his challenger by a magnitude of 7 or 8 to 1, with an enormous amount of outside corporate money and huge donations, and you got essentially the same result.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President supported and stood by Tom Barrett, but I certainly wouldn\'t read much into yesterday\'s result beyond its effect on who\'s occupying the governor\'s seat in Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 I certainly read in some of the analysis by you and your colleagues that even among the electorate that voted yesterday in Wisconsin, voters substantially approved of the President\'s positions when it comes to who they felt had the best vision for protecting and securing the middle class, and we certainly think -- I certainly think that the President\'s message about the steps we need to take to grow the economy and create jobs will resonate in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on President Clinton\'s remarks on CNBC? And it seems the President\'s tour with him was book-ended by some comments in which he differed with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Is this indicative of some tension, or is he just incapable of staying on message?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you saw, Caren, last night Mr. McKenna, the spokesman for President Clinton, put out a statement that clarified what President Clinton was saying and made abundantly clear that there\'s no daylight between President Clinton and President Obama when it comes to, A, the need to extend the tax cuts for middle-class Americans and to not extend tax cuts for those making over $250,000.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s position -- President Obama\'s position -- and that\'s the position that President Clinton has as well, which he made clear at the event that he -- in which he joined President Obama the other night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They both agree that the tax cuts for the wealthiest shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be extended permanently, but President Clinton and now Larry Summers has said that the tax cuts should be extended temporarily.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I don\'t believe that\'s what Larry Summers said.\xc2\xa0 But I think what, again, President Clinton\'s spokesman said last night is that President Clinton supported the extension of all the tax cuts in 2010 as part of the deal that President Obama reached with congressional leaders at the end of 2010.\xc2\xa0 He does not support the extension of the upper-income tax cuts, but he does, as President Obama does, support the permanent extension of tax cuts for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, let\'s be clear about something here.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton, in 1993 -- and I\'m old enough to say this from experience because I covered him -- passed a budget plan that included raising rates on upper-income Americans.\xc2\xa0 At the time, Republicans in the House and the Senate, including the very leaders that we have today, decried that budget plan as one that would cause a recession, economic decline, increase deficits, all the worst possible outcomes.\xc2\xa0 What happened?\xc2\xa0 The longest peacetime expansion in American history, 22 million jobs, and a situation where the middle class saw its incomes rise, not just for the wealthiest Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\'s fast-forward to the eight years prior to President Obama taking office.\xc2\xa0 Those same Republican leaders supported policies that led to a situation where the record surpluses that President Clinton bequeathed on his successor were transformed into record deficits when President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 The prescription that the Republicans put forward has been tried and it was a woeful failure.\xc2\xa0 And people understand that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President\'s vow not to ever extend the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthy again extend to a temporary extension aimed at getting some comprehensive agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama has been clear about his position and it has not changed:\xc2\xa0 We should not extend and he will not extend the tax cuts -- the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\'s bad policy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s bad for the economy, bad for our --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even temporary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to what the President has said and his position has not changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re leaving room --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 I\'m citing the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear, though -- so even temporarily he would not extend the Bush tax cuts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s position is that we absolutely should extend the tax cuts for the middle class; we should not extend and he will not extend tax cuts for the highest-income Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question you should be asking is, will the Republicans force a tax hike on 98 percent of tax-paying Americans because they\'re holding them hostage to tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the question.\xc2\xa0 Because if the Republican --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, Julie, it\'s not on the level -- what I\'m saying, he will not -- could I be more clear?\xc2\xa0 He will not support an extension of the upper-income Bush tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 He could not be more clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Larry Summers\' comments, though?\xc2\xa0 Does he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just saw that briefly in my BlackBerry before we took off.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s -- I\'ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that is what he said.\xc2\xa0 Larry Summers does not support an extension of high-end tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, what President Clinton said is that even though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, it\'s probably the best thing to do right now.\xc2\xa0 And he also said there\'s a recession.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering whether President Obama agrees with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Could you please look at what President Clinton\'s spokesman clarified?\xc2\xa0 President Clinton -- you can cherry-pick the words that he said.\xc2\xa0 He also referred --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not cherry-picking.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to the current expansion.\xc2\xa0 We understand -- you know.\xc2\xa0 You work for a news service that does a lot of economic analysis -- expansion means economic growth that is the opposite of recession -- as Matt McKenna clearly made abundantly clear to those who read his statement.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton referred to the expansion -- we\'re obviously not in a recession. He talked about coming out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Expansion is the opposite of recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What they both said -- as I read both of their comments, President Clinton\'s actual comments and Larry Summers\' comments, to say that although as a policy matter that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their preference to extend it, that given the context of what\'s going on now, it\'s probably the best thing to do for the economy. And I\'m wondering, does --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look at what President Clinton said.\xc2\xa0 He said he is for extending the middle-class tax cuts; he is for not -- he is against extending the high-income tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 He said that in the CNBC interview.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, Margaret, I\'ll --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- probably the best thing to do right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, do you even know what the pronoun he\'s referring to there, or the article is referring to there?\xc2\xa0 He made clear specifically in that interview that he\'s for extending the middle-class tax cuts, he opposes extending the high-income tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Speculating about what position the Republicans might take is one thing.\xc2\xa0 What he supports and what President Obama supports is another.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you happen to know if George W. Bush urged the President to extend those tax cuts while they were together?\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not think they had that conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the California fundraisers, in particular?\xc2\xa0 The President is getting a lot of heat over cavorting with showbiz types.\xc2\xa0 Rush Limbaugh is referring to him as Barack Kardashian, can you believe.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two words -- Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 Next question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner is -- seemed to (inaudible) sanctions this morning in Washington.\xc2\xa0 He said in his prepared remarks that if Syria doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take some action to back the Assad plan that the U.S. and other countries are going to have to probably take Chapter 7 action at the U.N.\xc2\xa0 And he was very forward-looking at that, sort of leaning towards that option.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\'s become more likely, and is that something that\'s being discussed more urgently at the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All options with regards to Syria are being discussed and the need to take urgent action, as I talked about this week, is very much on the minds of policymakers in the administration and at the United Nations and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific potential actions to preview for you, but I would certainly refer you to Secretary Geithner\'s statements.<br/>\n\tAnd we are constantly looking for ways to work with our international partners to further isolate and pressure Assad, to get him to cease the brutal campaign against the Syrian people, and to allow for the political transition that\'s already underway to be completed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. see Russia as moving more towards the U.S. in terms of being willing to take action on Syria?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us a little bit more about what Secretary Clinton is doing today in terms of reports we\'ve seen about her meeting with Syrian rebel leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to refer you to the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 In regards to Russia, we\'ve been very clear about our view that Russia can and should play a constructive role on Syria in bringing about the political transition in Syria that is so necessary and that the Syrian people so deserve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are glad that Russia is seeking broad international engagement on Syria and we hope that it will lead to progress.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re continuing our consultations with the Russians on Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any updates on what\'s going on with discussions with European leaders and deliberations over the crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific updates for you, except that we continue to have those consultations.\xc2\xa0 The President is very engaged, continues to be updated and briefed on the situation.\xc2\xa0 I think what I said yesterday remains true today, that our view is the Europeans have the capacity to act.\xc2\xa0 They have taken some important steps, but more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a -- it seems to be the case the Europeans are acting with a sense of urgency, and we view that as a good thing. And we hope for expedited action in coming weeks, including in the lead-up to the important G20 meeting in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more specifics for you on the process, which obviously is a European process that involves European decision-making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You read out a call with Prime Minister Cameron yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Have there been any other calls?\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken recently to Chancellor Merkel?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any other foreign leader calls to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I think as I mentioned yesterday, it certainly is the case that he has conversations both with leaders -- foreign leaders and congressional leaders and others that we don\'t always read out.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any to read out to you beyond the Cameron call.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit more about tomorrow, what he\'ll talk about in Las Vegas?\xc2\xa0 And also, will he personally address these Republican proposals?\xc2\xa0 They say that they have ways that he can pay for the student loans.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to address that personally?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into too much detail about the President\'s remarks.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll probably have more on that for you later.\xc2\xa0 Broadly, the President wants to talk about college affordability.\xc2\xa0 We had discussions about that yesterday in the sessions the Vice President led with Secretary Duncan and Director Cordray.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President views education as very much an integral part of our economic growth and building the foundation we need for competing in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And I think that he\'ll address the overall need for Congress to act, both on specific measures related to making education in college more affordable, but also more broadly, on a host of initiatives that the President has put forward that would directly and quickly have a positive impact on economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I said yesterday, the initiatives the President put forward in the American Jobs Act that Congress refused to pass not coincidentally addressed some of the very weaknesses, or weak sectors, that we see in our economy as it has recovered -- construction, layoffs among teachers and first responders.\xc2\xa0 Had Republicans in Congress not refused to pass those measures, outside independent economists say we would have added an additional 1 million jobs since the fall.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that would have had a very positive impact on the jobs picture today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why -- we know what we need to do.\xc2\xa0 We know what measures have positive impact on economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 Republicans talk about the measures they passed through the House that addressed our economic challenges, but outside economists say that\'s not right.\xc2\xa0 Giving substantial tax cuts to hedge fund managers and partners in law firms might be good for those individuals, but nobody estimates -- nobody credible in the economics field estimates that that would have an immediate impact on growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 We need to act now to help our economy now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to McCain\'s comments this morning about the -- this morning when he said that there were leaks from the highest levels in the White House and that was unacceptable?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to his comments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are not going to comment on any of the specific information contained in the articles referenced by Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 This administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations.\xc2\xa0 Any suggestion that this administration has authorized intentional leaks of classified information for political gain is grossly irresponsible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wisconsin, I know we sort of touched on this, but does President Obama plan, either for policy or campaign purposes, to spend any more time in Wisconsin now in the coming days or weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any travel to preview for you here.\xc2\xa0 For questions about campaign travel, you might check with the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Wisconsin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have none to announce for you.\xc2\xa0 The President, I\'m sure as part of his campaign, will travel around the country to many, many places -- many states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s not a concern that he has been personally substantially weakened in Wisconsin as a result of last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to the articles I read that said even in the electorate that voted yesterday, which will be -- which is substantially different from the electorate in Wisconsin that will vote in November, those voters yesterday said they believed that the President\'s policies are the right policies to protect the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to the campaign for more details.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the outcome in Wisconsin shows that the labor union movement has been weakened substantially?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would leave it to others to make -- to analyze that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point to the factors that I read about in the press, which include the enormous spending differential.\xc2\xa0 It\'s pretty hard to overcome when you\xe2\x80\x99re outspent 7 or 8 to 1.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Jon Bon Jovi was on that New York flight.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of anyone interesting who\xe2\x80\x99s on this flight, be they celebs or maybe members of Congress?\xc2\xa0 Who else is on the plane?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Marvin Nicholson is here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Awesome.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have any guests.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we have any guests on this flight.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk in California about the potential for -- theoretical potential for Democrats to gain House representation in California.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be any kind of a focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit in term of who he meets with, who he talks to at these events, and does he think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any prospect for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Any prospect for what?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Democratic gains in November in California.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of his campaign travel to California today.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t preclude that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be asked about that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a preview of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about at the gala -- the LGTB gala?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the same things he talks about when he addresses supporters and, in general, the American people, about his vision for moving this country forward, the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to pull us out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and the steps we need to take to continue the road -- to continue down the road to recovery.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll -- you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear much variance from those fundamental themes, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more specific comments to make to preview his remarks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- are there steps that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take to see gay marriage legalized nationwide?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made clear in his interview with Robin Roberts from ABC that what his personal views are.\xc2\xa0 He also made clear that he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s a state issue, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could I just go back to Todd\'s question?\xc2\xa0 Setting aside the Kardashians and Rush Limbaugh, does the President worry at all that by spending a lot of time with celebrities and at these glitzy fundraisers that it sends the wrong message at a time of economic distress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Caren, you should know -- and I know you do -- better than anyone -- and I am making this observation as someone who just consumes the news -- that the difference between President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s support, financial support and his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s is stark, but not in the way that you describe.\xc2\xa0 The fundamental difference is President Obama has vast numbers of small donors who support his campaign.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is something for the campaign to address.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just making this observation because I\xe2\x80\x99ve read it in the newspapers and in the wires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is not the case for the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the fact that the President enjoys that kind of support speaks to what his policy priorities are.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s out there fighting for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s out there fighting to protect the middle class and help it expand, to create an economic foundation that will allow the middle class to thrive, as opposed to the situation the middle class experienced in the first decade of this century under the previous President where average incomes for the middle class stagnated or declined while average incomes for the wealthiest Americans increased dramatically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is happy to have the support that he has, but the bedrock foundation of his support are the millions and millions of Americans who believe in his vision for this country\xe2\x80\x99s future and believe that he has their backs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said today that some of the ongoing economic developments like the weak jobs report could actually help make a case for more stimulus.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether President Obama also thinks that that\'s true, and whether he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that the Federal Open Market Committee does recommend more stimulus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know I don\'t discuss matters involving the Fed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the report that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Congress should pass measures that would have a direct, positive impact on our economy and on jobs right away.\xc2\xa0 He has proposed a number of such initiatives and Republicans have opposed them, largely because they refuse to ask oil and gas companies to give up their subsidies or hedge fund managers to give up a tax loophole that allows them to pay income at a rate far lower -- income tax at a rate far lower than you and I and everybody else standing here pays.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s a choice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong choice.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong choice for the American people.\xc2\xa0 So however you would describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives -- which were paid for in the American Jobs Act -- those initiatives to put teachers back to work, construction workers on the job would have a positive effect on economic growth and job creation right away.\xc2\xa0 Congress should act.\xc2\xa0 They should not sit on their hands.\xc2\xa0 They were sent here -- sent there to Washington to get things done for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is going to continue to make that case in the days and weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one fundraiser question about tonight?\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be serenaded by Darren Criss.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in Ryan Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xc2\xa0 When was the last time he watched "Glee"?\xc2\xa0 How often does he watch it?\xc2\xa0 Does he have a favorite character?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President talk about that. I think he has referenced some of the shows he does watch, so I don\'t know -- I don\'t know the answer to your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he a fan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou know, I have to note, going back to this issue that we were talking about before, that you have to admire the sheer gall it takes to argue, as some have, I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, when it comes to responsible fiscal stewardship that the very "architect" -- and I put that in quotes -- who served a President who inherited budget surpluses projected to last into the future, and then eight years later delivered the largest deficits in history, is now arguing that those ideas, the policies that created that situation are superior than the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\xc2\xa0 And I know you guys see that for what it is, but it is remarkable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me talk about before, in the previous administration we had two unpaid-for tax cuts, two unpaid-for wars -- those tax cuts overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest Americans while the middle class got stiffed -- the Medicare prescription drug benefit that was unpaid for, and those policy choices resulted in the very structural deficit that we deal with today -- take that as a gift, then along with that gift give cascading financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this President had to deal with.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a funny day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t10:36 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
