CDT</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us aboard Air Force One as we make our way from Houston to Austin.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to participating in celebration today at the LBJ Museum and Library.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver remarks on this very significant anniversary.</p>\n<p class="p3">With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vladimir Putin has told European leaders the dispute over Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s gas debt to Russia could affect supplies of Russian gas to Europe.\xc2\xa0 Is this something you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of, concerned about?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that specific report.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the issue of energy security in Europe is one that we\xe2\x80\x99re always paying close attention to.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear in the past that it\xe2\x80\x99s wholly inappropriate to use energy exports in order to achieve diplomatic or geopolitical objectives, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that view clear.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re in constant conversation with our European partners on matters like this.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a broad statement.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that latest report.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Congress is poised this afternoon to pass a bill banning the envoy that Iran has chosen for the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that that selection is not viable, but will President Obama sign that piece of legislation?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you noted, Josh, the House has not acted as of yet, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to withhold any statement about --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know it\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill, and it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going to pass.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear and have communicated to the Iranians that the selection they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward is not viable, and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to make that understood.\xc2\xa0 In terms of legislation, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a view on it in terms of the President at this time.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what kind of impact or consequence does the legislation have in connection with the nuclear talks on Iran?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 None that we have seen.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of fill-in-the-blank question when it comes to Iran with the issues that we have with them, that we continue to have serious disagreements with Iran over.\xc2\xa0 And this matter is but one.\xc2\xa0 The talks continue; they continue to be workmanlike and productive.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen no impact on those discussions from some of these other issues.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eleven Democratic senators are calling on the President to outline an explicit timeline for approving the Keystone pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to do that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position on that process hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, which is that it needs to run its appropriate course without interference from the White House or Congress.\xc2\xa0 It was because of actions taken by Republicans in Congress that one delay was caused in the process already.\xc2\xa0 So that review continues at the State Department where it\xe2\x80\x99s housed in accordance with past practice of previous administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And when there\xe2\x80\x99s a decision to be announced, it will be announced.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, voting rights is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be on the table tomorrow when the President is in New York and perhaps today as well.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan bill from Senators Leahy and Sensenbrenner that would fix some of the issues created by the Supreme Court ruling that undermine parts of the Voting Rights Act.\xc2\xa0 Is that legislation that the President could support?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that effort is underway and we support the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan effort to address the need created by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen legislation, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific comment on that.\xc2\xa0 But I think as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past and we have said in the past, it is certainly heartening that not just Democrats but Republicans as well understand the need to fix some of the problems created by the Supreme Court decision.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the intelligence community\xe2\x80\x99s IG report on the Boston bombing?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House still believe that Russia has been a constructive partner on law enforcement issues?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has seen it, and in terms of the role the FBI had and the information that they received from the Russians, I would refer you to the FBI for specifics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">The U.S. and Russia have a shared interest in preventing terrorist attacks and a history of close cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Following the attack in Boston, we received cooperation from the Russian government in the investigation.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve explained, based on limited information provided by the Russian government, the FBI conducted a thorough investigation of one of the brothers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2011 and did not find any terrorism activity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">As part of that investigation, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for things as derogatory, such as -- such things as derogatory telephone communication; possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity; associations with other persons of interest; travel history and plans in education history.\xc2\xa0 The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members.\xc2\xa0 The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But for more specifics on that, I would refer you to the FBI.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the information that we were provided by the Russians led to that examination that I just described to you, which did not produce any indication of terrorism activity.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any interaction with any other President today?\xc2\xa0 And how long is this speech going to take?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You in a rush to get home, Steve?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe I should have worded that a little differently.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was Steve Holland, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any interaction that the President will have with a former President.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that those who are participating in the event are doing so at different times, not when we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be there.\xc2\xa0 But if that changes I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 On the speech itself, it will be -- the length will be just right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, last night the President criticized Republicans and others in terms of the voting rights issue.\xc2\xa0 But other than criticizing Republicans, is the President satisfied that he\xe2\x80\x99s done enough in his five years in office to expand civil rights?\xc2\xa0 What does he feel like has been his legacy on civil rights at this point?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President will I think address the broader subject today, and the legacy of Lyndon Baines Johnson and of those people, famous and unknown, who helped make the Civil Rights Act a reality, and helped make some of the other landmark achievements in the Johnson administration on civil rights a reality.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s done enough as President?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is going to let others judge his record.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, some people say that he\xe2\x80\x99s been more willing to discuss race in the second term, more willing to take on issues that have been of concern to the African American community in his second term.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I would agree with that.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President has obviously addressed issues that affect all Americans, including minorities -- African Americans, Latinos and others.\xc2\xa0 When he talks about the challenge posed by a lack of mobility economically, obviously that speaks to people who are struggling to get into the middle class, and that can be something identified as an issue that speaks to minorities but it speaks to all Americans.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking a lot about in his second term.</p>\n<p class="p2">On sort of other civil rights issues, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that there has been enormous progress made under this administration when it comes to LGBT rights -- historic progress.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President wants to continue and wants to see continue.\xc2\xa0 He also believes that our work is not done when it comes to ensuring that our laws are enforced, when it comes to equality for women.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And as the President noted last night, it is astounding, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, that not a single Republican in the Senate thought it was worth their time or worth their support to vote for a bill that would simply give women more tools to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re paid fairly.\xc2\xa0 And the data is clear on why this is necessary, but for some reason Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to agree on this issue, which is a little shocking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in Austin celebrating civil rights victories of 50 years ago.\xc2\xa0 Is there something substantive that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be proposing?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to emphasize paycheck fairness as the next civil rights movement?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m simply noting that as an issue that is in the arena of civil rights, the Paycheck Fairness Act is something that Congress could have joined the President in moving forward, and they chose not to -- Republicans chose not to, which is confounding --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is will he be --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview the speech.\xc2\xa0 I would note that -- beyond saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about all those Americans both famous and not who contributed to making the Civil Rights Act a reality.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about President Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s historic achievement and his legacy.\xc2\xa0 And he will talk about the need to safeguard that progress to continue to move this country forward, as LBJ did.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any readout of his -- interaction with President Bush yesterday?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the reporting I saw on it captured the meeting -- the brief meeting very well.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to add to that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something the President -- I know the President and First Lady greatly appreciated the fact that President George H.W. Bush greeted them on the tarmac.\xc2\xa0 And the President has enormous regard and respect for President Bush.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any lawmakers or other notables that are on this flight with us today?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get you -- we do have some.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get you a list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be meeting with the Johnsons\xe2\x80\x99 daughters?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that he will -- upon arrival, he and the First Lady will spend some time -- just a minute, let me see if I can get this page here -- with members of President Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s family, as well as the director of the LBJ Presidential Library, Mark Updegrove, and Congressman Lewis, John Lewis.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be doing with them -- he\xe2\x80\x99s taking a tour, right?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a review of some of the exhibits.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the pool going along?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is the pool going?\xc2\xa0 My esteemed colleague says yes.\xc2\xa0 Hannah Hankins coming to my rescue.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 All right -- oh, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.</p>\n<p class="p4">END<br/>\n\t10:28 A.M. CDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
