Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:08 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all. Appreciate you accommodating the schedule today.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll just experiment with the time a little bit and try to get ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that are slated for 11:50 a.m. or so.\xc2\xa0 If we want the briefing to continue I\'m happy to do that, but if there are those of you who need to leave here to make the call time at 11:25 a.m., I will not be offended if there\xe2\x80\x99s a few people who run to the back of the room at 11:20 a.m.</p>\n<p>Let me do one thing before we get to the questions, Jim, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me here.\xc2\xa0 Health care workers on the frontlines of the Ebola fight certainly aren\'t in it for the recognition.\xc2\xa0 But today their heroism and selflessness was on display because of Time Magazine\xe2\x80\x99s decision to name them its Person of the Year.\xc2\xa0 The administration, including the President, could not be prouder of the brave men and women who have committed themselves to this effort in a foreign land.</p>\n<p>You had an opportunity to meet several of them when the President welcomed these health care heroes to the White House back in October.\xc2\xa0 Several of them have since returned to the White House for holiday receptions and tours, and we\'ve continued to honor their heroism through measures big and small.</p>\n<p>We must not forget that in order to bring this epidemic under control on the frontlines, indeed, the only way to prevent additional cases here in the United States, we need more of these medical professionals.\xc2\xa0 USAID, CDC, and the United States military, working alongside their partners inside and outside of government, have sought to recruit and train more of them.\xc2\xa0 In West Africa, the United States government now has the capacity, through our civilian and military personnel, to train several hundred of these responders per week and USAID\xe2\x80\x99s efforts are facilitating the work of thousands more on the frontlines throughout the affected countries.\xc2\xa0 Because of these efforts, we are seeing signs of hope and progress, especially in Liberia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are men and women who deserve international recognition, and today we are pleased that they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving more of it.</p>\n<p>So, after that piece of good news, Jim, let\xe2\x80\x99s go ahead and get started with the questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple of topics.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, in the gaggle, regarding questions about the legality of the actions discovered in the torture report, you said that that was up to the Justice Department to make those determinations.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering, does the President, given the context of the report, believe that the Justice Department should be evaluating whether there were any laws broken?\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to meet with Eric Holder to discuss it, or with his nominee, Loretta Lynch, to discuss the contents of that report?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I would refer you to the Department of Justice on this.\xc2\xa0 And I do that principally because it\'s my understanding that the Department of Justice actually did conduct a review of the actions of CIA operatives that are mentioned in this report, that there was a career federal prosecutor who was assigned to this case and that this individual conducted an extensive inquiry, and upon looking at the facts in evidence decided not to pursue an indictment.</p>\n<p>So for questions about what that investigation included and how and why that conclusion was reached, I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 And again, these are the kinds of decisions that should be made without any sort of -- without even the appearance of political interference.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ve been very clear about the proper role for the Justice Department in this matter.</p>\n<p>In addition, I understand that there were Inspector General investigations -- at least one, I think maybe even two -- that were conducted along these lines.\xc2\xa0 And again, the Inspector General is somebody who operates independent of the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 And again, for the conclusions of those reports, I believe at least some of those conclusions have been made public, so I\'d refer you to those reports.\xc2\xa0 But again, those are reports that were done absent the -- or aside from any sort of presidential directive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with former CIA officials that the interrogation techniques did result in actionable intelligence?\xc2\xa0 Or does he agree with the Senate in their conclusion that they did not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, you are acknowledging that there are a couple of sides of a very vigorous, ongoing debate.\xc2\xa0 This is a debate that occurred around the announcement of the successful mission to take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 There was a similarly robust debate that occurred around the release of the movie, Zero Dark Thirty, that talked and examined issues around the bin Laden mission.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The conclusion that this President has reached is that these differences, which are held by well-meaning, patriotic Americans, many of whom have detailed knowledge of these programs and of our national security efforts more broadly, is that there actually is one thing that both sides do agree on and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President agrees, too, which is that the most powerful -- one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal to protect and advance our interests around the globe is the moral authority of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And the Commander-in-Chief concluded that the use of the techniques that are described in this report significantly undermined the moral authority of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President, on his second full day here at the White House, issued an executive order ending those tactics. The other thing that the President did -- and there has not been a lot of discussion of this lately, so I did want to call it to your attention -- the President also, through an executive action, asked that the Department of Justice and a couple of other relevant national security agencies conduct a review of the way that the U.S. government interrogates those individuals who are in U.S. custody.\xc2\xa0 He also urged this task force to conduct a review of the way that individuals who are in U.S. government custody are handled and in some cases transferred to other countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the outcome of this review that was led by a career prosecutor identified a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is he concluded -- again, I think this was in August of 2009 -- he concluded that the Army Field Manual and law enforcement techniques were sufficient guidance for U.S. personnel who are conducting interrogations -- that that was clear guidance that they could use.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He also suggested the creation of something that we have used to great effect on a number of occasions, something called the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group.\xc2\xa0 This is another terrible government acronym -- it\xe2\x80\x99s called the HIG -- but that acronym does not accurately describe exactly what this group is. What it essentially suggests is that there should be an inter-agency group of expert interrogators convened where they can share best practices and that they can be deployed on very short notice to essentially anywhere in the world where a high-value detainee has been taken into custody.\xc2\xa0 And these expert interrogators can then use their skills and training to elicit information that\xe2\x80\x99s useful for national security, but also in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prohibit our ability to bring these individuals to justice in the U.S. court system.\xc2\xa0 And this -- the HIG has been deployed on a number of occasions to great effect.</p>\n<p>The other reforms that were included in this review included specific guidelines that U.S. personnel should use when transferring individuals from the custody of the U.S. government to other countries.\xc2\xa0 And this included getting certain assurances from other countries about how these individuals will be treated when they are detained.\xc2\xa0 It also provides guidelines for U.S. personnel to conduct some oversight and ensure that these other countries are living up to the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in terms of the detention and treatment of these individuals.</p>\n<p>So this is just one example and, again, this is the result of a task force that the President created on his second day in office to make sure that proper guidance and oversight and reform was implemented as it relates to interrogation and detention of individuals in U.S. custody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is important because the Senate report that was released yesterday highlights that there was not good guidance, that there was not good leadership, and that there was not proper oversight of a lot of these programs.\xc2\xa0 And yet that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the President sought to institute on his second day in office.\xc2\xa0 And I think it demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to taking seriously, very seriously, the need to show some leadership and to reform some of the shortcomings of these programs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the question of effectiveness, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to remain agnostic?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to let the debate play out without him playing a role?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the conclusion that the President has reached -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s two principal things here.\xc2\xa0 The conclusion that the President reached is a principle that people on both sides of this debate can agree to, which is that the moral authority of the United States of America is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal to protect and advance U.S. interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President that the use of these techniques, regardless of whether or not they elicit national intelligence information, undermine our ability to use this very powerful tool.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the President outlawed these techniques in his first or second day in office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the omnibus -- $1.1 trillion, 1,600 pages -- will the President sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 This is something that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he read it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He has not.\xc2\xa0 Neither has everybody in the administration, so it\xe2\x80\x99s still something that the administration is reviewing.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of things I can say about it, though, that we know generally.</p>\n<p>As a general matter, I can tell you that we certainly are pleased that Democrats and Republicans on the Hill do seem to be coming together around a proposal that will avoid a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked in the past about how a government shutdown is bad for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And particularly at this point where we are starting to see some headwinds from the global economy at the same time that the U.S. economy is demonstrating signs of real strength and resilience, the last thing that we need are additional headlines -- headwinds emanating from Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are pleased that they seem to be coming around a proposal that would avoid exactly that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll also recall, Jim, that over the course of the last several months there have been a couple of specific requests that this administration has made for funding some key national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 That includes funding for our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding, based on the topline review that\xe2\x80\x99s been done of this agreement, that there are substantial resources that have been committed to that effort.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are gratified by that.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the administration, early last fall, made a specific request for resources to deal with the Ebola fight that I talked about a little earlier, both in terms of making sure that we have the resources necessary to stop this outbreak in its tracks in West Africa, as well as improve readiness at medical facilities here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Again, a topline review of the agreement does indicate that there are significant resources that are committed to that effort.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are pleased by that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There also are some key funding proposals related to domestic priorities that will benefit the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Just to take one pertinent example, there is funding in there that is continued for early childhood education programs -- something that the President is going to talk about across the street in less than an hour.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are gratified that there continue to be -- that there is a commitment of resources for that important priority.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the ledger, Republicans had identified as their priority to try to undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to reform our broken immigration system using executive actions and to cut carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 Again, based on a cursory review of that agreement, it does not appear that Republicans were successful in that effort.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something we\xe2\x80\x99re gratified by.</p>\n<p>At the same time, this is a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans have signed on to it and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to review -- I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there are going to be some things in here that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to like, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sort of consider the whole package before we make a decision about whether or not to sign it.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on that.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bill contains some pretty significant rollbacks for Dodd-Frank reforms.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what the White House makes of those rollbacks, and whether the White House is worried that this is going to, in a new Congress led by Republicans, lead to Wall Street being more emboldened in terms of asking for rollbacks on these measures.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on some of the specific proposals.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of these new reports, but this is a piece of legislation that is 1,600 pages long and we\xe2\x80\x99ve only had it -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for less than 16 hours.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re still conducting a review to sort of see all of the -- take a look at all the puts and takes that are included.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reserve judgment on the individual provisions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let me say, as a general matter, that one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s principal domestic policy achievements is the passage of Wall Street reform that ensures that middle-class families and small business owners across the country have a voice in our financial system, that their interests are represented and protected.\xc2\xa0 That is good for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for our economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think it represents a significant departure from Wall Street interests that are used to walking around town with their lobbyists getting whatever they want.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American people -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the vast majority of Democrats or even Republicans are going to look too kindly on a Congress that\xe2\x80\x99s ready to go back and start doing the bidding of Wall Street interests again.</p>\n<p>So, again, that will be a decision that Republicans will have to make for themselves, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear where the President stands on that question.\xc2\xa0 I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear where the American people stand on that question, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have no specific comments on the rollbacks that are in this at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct, because we\xe2\x80\x99re still reviewing the broader package.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then just back to the report for a second. Does the President foresee any repercussions for the CIA as a result of the release of the report yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President has strongly supported the release of this report, and the reason for that is that he believes that transparency is important in this matter.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that the United States is willing to face up to its shortcomings, and is willing to be honest about those shortcomings, and is willing to be as candid as possible about our commitment to ensuring that those shortcomings don\xe2\x80\x99t occur again.\xc2\xa0 And that I think the President believes is an important measure of accountability, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a way for us to demonstrate to the American people, to our friends and allies around the globe what it is the United States stands for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I mentioned in response to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question that the President is concerned that the use of those enhanced interrogation techniques undermined America\xe2\x80\x99s moral authority around the globe.\xc2\xa0 One substantial way that we can rebuild that moral authority is to be honest about what happened, to be as transparent as possible about it, and to demonstrate a clear commitment to ensuring that those kinds of things don\xe2\x80\x99t ever happen again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, regardless of which side you are on this, and regardless of which party you represent, and regardless of which administration you served in, the strengthening of that moral authority is, without argument, a very substantial way that we can contribute to America\xe2\x80\x99s national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President thinks that that moral authority, as you put it, can be regained without holding specific individuals accountable for actions they may have taken during that time period?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think moral authority is something that you rebuild overnight.\xc2\xa0 This is a process.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the release of this report is a critically important step because it demonstrates a commitment to transparency; it demonstrates a commitment to accountability in terms of fessing up for falling short; and it also demonstrates a commitment to making sure these kinds of shortcomings don\xe2\x80\x99t ever happen again.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President acted quickly and unequivocally to outlaw these techniques.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President asked for this task force to review the policies related to interrogations and detentions.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why they came up with these very specific proposals that, again, ensure that we are doing everything we can to strengthen our national security and live up to the kinds of values that we hold so dear in this country.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can we just get a general reaction from the President when he found out some of the details that were in this report?\xc2\xa0 Because there are details in this report -- you mentioned that Eric Holder, the Justice Department looked at this several years back.\xc2\xa0 But there are details in this report that the American people have not seen before -- waterboarding at levels that were not known before, some of the treatment that these detainees were subjected to, being put in dungeon-like conditions.\xc2\xa0 Rectal hydration is one term that jumps out at you when you read this report.\xc2\xa0 I mean, did the President just have a general gut reaction when he saw some of the details in this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say -- the first thing, Jim, is that this is a report that was released publicly for the first time yesterday and the President, as I mentioned just a minute ago to Roberta, the President was strongly supportive of the release of this report.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that the President has been briefed on these matters.\xc2\xa0 The report has been done for some time.\xc2\xa0 There has been an ongoing effort to declassify it.\xc2\xa0 So the President was not in a position yesterday of reacting for the first time in the way that many of you and many Americans were.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s known about this for a while?\xc2\xa0 Is he appalled by this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this are made clear by looking at the specific actions that he has taken to unequivocally outlaw them.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that these are at all consistent with American values.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that this is consistent with the strategy that will strengthen national security or make it easier to promote our national interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he actually thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite, that the use of these kinds of techniques only undermines our moral authority around the globe and makes it harder for us to work closely with our allies and partners around the globe.</p>\n<p>But the release of this report, coming clean about what exactly happened and demonstrating a continued commitment to ensuring they never happen again is a critical part of rebuilding that moral authority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said yesterday in the gaggle that the President does stand by his claim that these techniques in some cases amounted to torture -- \xe2\x80\x9ctorture.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a violation of U.S. law?\xc2\xa0 To torture somebody?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The questions about what violates U.S. law and what sort of impact that has on prosecutorial decisions are decisions that are made by career prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 And there was a federal career prosecutor that took a look at this matter several years ago and reached a conclusion that there was not enough evidence to prosecute any individual.\xc2\xa0 But, again, for questions about how that investigation was conducted and how that conclusion was reached, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President believe that these new details that the American people are seeing for the first time and, indeed, people around the world are seeing for the first time, do those details warrant going back and reexamining whether people should be prosecuted?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question to ask.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question for the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the President going to answer that question?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that that should be revisited?\xc2\xa0 He is the President.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is the President.\xc2\xa0 But, again, decisions about prosecution are made by career federal prosecutors at the Department of Justice and this is something that they have looked into.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important for people to understand that, again, this report, as important as it is to release it, as far as I know at least, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include a whole lot of new information that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t previously available to these federal prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 Now, again, you can ask them whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, but they conducted an in-depth review of this already.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 --2300 said that the CIA misled the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 President Bush did not know about some of this or all of this until 2006.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a point of some contention, based on the public comments of some individuals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case?\xc2\xa0 You think that President Bush knew about this before --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I\'m saying, Jim, is I think that there are some people who said that that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 They would be in a better position to know that than I would, frankly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- get to the bottom of this because you\'re saying that the prosecutors, the career prosecutors who looked at this during this administration saw all the details that were provided in this report yesterday?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You should check with them to find that out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 In the Wall Street Journal, there was an op-ed from three former directors of the CIA -- this goes back to Jim Kuhnhenn\xe2\x80\x99s question -- who said that this intelligence helped lead to the killing of Osama bin Laden. Can you answer whether or not that is true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say, Jim, is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you said it undermines moral authority and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 But this is a key question and it seems that the White House should have an answer on that one way or the other.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I agree with everything you said until the very end, because, simply, the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this are that even if this information did yield important national security information, the damage that it did to our moral authority, in the mind of this President, means that those interrogation techniques should not have been implemented in the first place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other thing that is true is it is impossible to know the counterfactual.\xc2\xa0 It\'s impossible to know whether or not this information could have been obtained using tactics that are consistent with the Army Field Manual, or other law enforcement techniques, and that essentially enhanced interrogation techniques were not necessary to obtain that information.\xc2\xa0 That is something that is unknowable.\xc2\xa0 What is knowable --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s short of what Senator Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s report concludes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understand that there are people who have strongly held views on both sides.\xc2\xa0 I stipulated that earlier.\xc2\xa0 There is one thing, however, that the President has concluded, that there are other things that we can\'t know, but there is one thing that the President knows.\xc2\xa0 The President knows that continuing to employ the techniques that are described in that report would only undermine one of the most powerful weapons in our arsenal to protect American national security, and that is the moral authority around the globe of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that that moral authority, that tool is worth protecting and strengthening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why he outlawed these techniques during his second or third day in office.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President directed the Department of Justice and other members of the national security team to conduct this broad review of the guidelines and procedures for interrogating and detaining individuals who are in U.S. custody.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why the President has strongly advocated for the United States Senate to release this declassified version of the executive summary, because it demonstrates a commitment on the part of the United States of America to be honest about our shortcomings.\xc2\xa0 When we have fallen short of our values we should be straightforward about that and we should demonstrate clearly to the world that we made a mistake and that that mistake is never going to happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the omnibus, very quickly, does this deal that was cut on the omnibus, does that set up an immigration cliff, a Homeland Security cliff?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you may not have an agreement on funding this department come February or March, or whatever.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would be surprised, Jim, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised, but I would be surprised if Republicans take the position that they are going to withhold funding from border security, from people who are conducting criminal background checks, from other elements of our federal government that are critical to homeland security just in protest over the President taking an executive action that is consistent with the kind of actions that Democratic and Republican Presidents have taken in the past.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there was a -- the head of the ACLU, I think, in our paper made a proposal the other day.\xc2\xa0 Article 2, Section 2 does not give the power of pardon to the Justice Department; it gives it to the President.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about the idea of offering some sort of pardon for people who conducted or approved or supervised the torture programs?\xc2\xa0 And is that something that he would even think about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to give you -- I haven\'t had an extended conversation with him about this, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I can give you a whole lot of insight into his own thinking on this.\xc2\xa0 But the thing that I can say is that this is something that has been considered by the Justice Department, that they did their own investigation in terms of whether or not crimes occurred that could be prosecuted.\xc2\xa0 And essentially a pardon would absolve anybody of punishment based on a criminal finding like that, but since a criminal finding like that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been found, it seems a little premature at this point to be talking about a pardon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But pardons have been used in the past by Presidents to absolve people of crimes where charges haven\'t been brought.\xc2\xa0 And I guess kind of the question that he gets at, whether or not he would ultimately ever do it or not, is has the President decided -- notwithstanding whatever the Justice Department has said, has the President decided in his own mind whether there were crimes that were committed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned to Jim, that\xe2\x80\x99s a decision for career federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a decision for career federal prosecutors, because if the President were to exercise the pardon power, he would have to make the determination in his own mind.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department can make recommendations, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t decide whether or not to pardon anybody, right?\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99d have to come to a conclusion, yes or no, in his own mind.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking -- maybe the answer is he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not he has -- I have not had this specific conversation with him about it, so I just can\xe2\x80\x99t shed much light on his thinking as it relates to a pardon in this scenario.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While you\xe2\x80\x99ve been up at the podium, Senator Mark Udall went to the Senate floor and discussed the so-called Panetta Review, which is a classified document, but he said that the findings of the review are that Director Brennan and the CIA are continuing to willfully provide inaccurate information and misrepresent the efficacy of torture.\xc2\xa0 He says the CIA has knowingly provided inaccurate information to the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And he accused the White House of not having any moral leadership on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk about if there are concerns within the White House that the CIA is continuing to misrepresent what they\xe2\x80\x99ve told the committee, and your response to Senator Udall.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you put me in an awkward spot because I haven\'t seen entirely what Senator Udall has said.\xc2\xa0 And if he\xe2\x80\x99s citing classified information, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to discuss from here.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the thing I do feel like I can speak pretty authoritatively about in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of leadership, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear sign of the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on this issue that after he\xe2\x80\x99d been sitting in the Oval Office for two days, he issued an executive order unequivocally banning the kind of techniques that are described in this report.</p>\n<p>At the same time, on that second day, the President also urged -- or basically called on members of his national security team to conduct this review of interrogation policies and of our detention policies in a way that has yielded reforms to that program that the report itself says were badly needed.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President take the position of strongly encouraging the release of the declassified executive summary of this report.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication that the President has very clear views on this.\xc2\xa0 He has spoken publicly about it on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is pretty proud, as he should be, of his efforts to try to rectify many of the shortcomings that were included in this report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that you said yesterday that the President retains confidence in Director Brennan, but does he retain confidence that the CIA has not misled Congress in any way during the Obama administration?\xc2\xa0 Misled or lied to the Congress?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Justin, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to account for a whole lot of people.\xc2\xa0 We certainly would have the expectation that everybody in this administration, including everybody who works for the Central Intelligence Agency, would be truthful and honest with members of Congress, particularly when they\xe2\x80\x99re under oath.</p>\n<p>But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to react directly to what Senator Udall has said without seeing exactly what he said and without being able to discuss the classified report that he says he\xe2\x80\x99s relying on for his information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just really quick on the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 I know that you said earlier that you guys are still reviewing a lot of it, but there were a couple provisions I just wanted to run by and see if you had any reaction on.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a provision that kind of rolls back the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s school lunch program, cutting out requirements on sodium and whole grains.\xc2\xa0 There is a provision on D.C. home rule, abortion and marijuana legalization, and cuts to the EPA.\xc2\xa0 And all of these seem like policies that the President or the White House has kind of discussed in the past and so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if any of them are deal-breakers for you guys.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all things that the White House is continuing to review.\xc2\xa0 Again, that report is 1,600 pages long, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even had 16 hours to review it yet.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a look at all those things.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident there are going to be things we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to like in there, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of a bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to review it, and as soon as we have a specific position to articulate we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just coming back -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99d referred a lot of questions to Justice Department on this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 Does the President accept the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s decision that there is no prosecutorial crime that was committed here?\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve said it, they\xe2\x80\x99ve investigated, they have decided not to prosecute.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 But does the President accept the conclusion of his own Justice Department there are no prosecutable crimes committed here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is the way that our criminal justice system works, which is that we have career federal prosecutors that are insulated from any sort of political interference, even the appearance of political interference.\xc2\xa0 And the President accepts that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that this system works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But so he -- I understand how the system works.\xc2\xa0 Career prosecutors aren\'t interfered with.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal views as being somebody who was so opposed to this program and seeing what he has seen and what he has known about for a long time -- does he personally believe there were no crimes committed here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, that is a question, again, that is not a question for the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the President of the United States who conducts a criminal inquiry into the actions of somebody who works at the CIA.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of a career federal prosecutor who can take an independent look at this, can do so without any sort of political interference, and can conduct an investigation and reach a conclusion based on their own view of the facts.</p>\n<p>That is the way that our criminal justice system works.\xc2\xa0 The President has confidence in the criminal justice system.\xc2\xa0 He has certainly got confidence in the professionalism of the prosecutors who reviewed this matter.\xc2\xa0 But again, that is a conclusion for them to draw, not one for the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a yes-or-no thing.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re answering yes when you speak -- the President accepts the decision of the Justice Department, the finding of the Justice Department that there were not prosecutable crimes committed by the CIA in this program.\xc2\xa0 Yes, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is something that federal career prosecutors looked at carefully.\xc2\xa0 They did so without any sort of political interference, as they should.\xc2\xa0 That is the way that our criminal justice system continues to work, and the President has confidence both in the justice system and in the way that it was deployed in this particular situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he accepts no crimes committed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So the President, again, is confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had federal career prosecutors who took a careful look at this.\xc2\xa0 They used extensive resources to sort of review all the relevant materials.\xc2\xa0 I suspect they interviewed witnesses.\xc2\xa0 This is part of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they found no crimes worth prosecuting committed and the President accepts that?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all -- just a simple --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my best to answer your question, which is, there is a process in place that is administered by career professionals who did what they were supposed to do in taking a careful look at this.\xc2\xa0 And they reached their own conclusions, and the President certainly believes firmly in their competence and in the system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I want to ask you a direct question that you\xe2\x80\x99ve --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to give you a direct answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I really would appreciate a direct answer on this one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President nominated John Brennan to be his CIA Director.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Nailed it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No further questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So John Brennan, the President\xe2\x80\x99s CIA Director, has said that this program, these harsh interrogations, what the President has called torture, provided valuable and unique intelligence that helped disrupt plots and save lives.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just a point-blank question:\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with his own CIA Director that this program saved lives?\xc2\xa0 Just a yes or a no.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, this is the thing.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about what he believes about these programs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been clear on this question, has he?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been clear about the most important question.\xc2\xa0 And the most important --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This did save lives?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the most important question is, should we have done it?\xc2\xa0 And the answer to that question is, no.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques was good for our national security.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that it was good for our moral authority.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he believes that it undermined our moral authority and that is why he banned them.</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing that the President has been clear about -- and the President talked about this at some length in the interview that he did yesterday with Jose Diaz-Balart from Telemundo, where he was asked about -- I believe it was in the Telemundo interview, it may have been the Univision interview -- where he was asked specifically, if he were President of the United States at the time in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, would he have made the same decisions that President Bush did.\xc2\xa0 And the President was clear about how difficult an environment that was, that there was intense pressure that was put on the federal government and members of our national security team to keep the American people safe.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very sympathetic to how difficult it was for everybody to operate in that environment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All the more reason that we can be clear and unequivocal now about how the United States will never again implement the use of enhanced interrogation techniques because it undermines our moral authority, which the President views -- and I think everybody can agree on this -- is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal to protect the interests of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But John Brennan has come out specifically and he has provided specific examples of where this program saved lives.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get at -- I understand the President thinks it was the wrong thing to do, ut did it save lives?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jon --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- continuing to mislead the American public and Congress, as the Senate Intelligence Committee report alleges?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, listen.\xc2\xa0 The President has relied for years now on the advice of John Brennan.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan is a decorated professional and a patriot, and he is somebody that the President relies on, on a daily basis to keep this country safe.<br/>\n\tMr. Brennan worked here in the White House for four years at the President\xe2\x80\x99s top Homeland Security Advisor and Mr. Brennan has continued his service as the Director of the CIA.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that he has done an exemplary job in both of those roles and the President is pleased that he is able to rely on the advice of a dedicated professional like Mr. Brennan to protect the United States and our interests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he right on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jon --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not a small question.\xc2\xa0 This gets at the --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a small question, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a smaller question then whether or not these kinds of interrogation techniques are worth it.\xc2\xa0 And again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that it\'s not.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- because of the way they undermine the moral authority of the United States, and because the moral authority of the United States is such a powerful weapon as we try to protect our interests around the globe, the President does not believe that those kinds of techniques should be used.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But the CIA --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has acted unilaterally to unequivocally outlaw them, and he did so in his second day in office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the CIA said yesterday that these tactics provided information that helped prevent another mass casualty attack.\xc2\xa0 If that is true, if these tactics helped prevent a mass casualty attack, lots of American lives, the lives of our allies, how can the President say they weren\xe2\x80\x99t worth it?\xc2\xa0 Is he saying it\xe2\x80\x99s better to see those lives lost?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course not, Jon.\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what the CIA is saying.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s prevented a mass casualty attack.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But what the President believes is that our moral authority is critically important to representing our interests and protecting the United States of America, and that the use of these techniques undermines that authority.\xc2\xa0 It degrades our ability to coordinate with our allies and partners all around the globe.\xc2\xa0 Its hurts our standing in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is committed to rebuilding that moral authority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And one way we can do that, and one important step in doing that is releasing this report, acknowledging our shortcomings, being as transparent as possible about them, and being just as clear about the commitment that this President and his administration has to ensuring that they\xe2\x80\x99re never used again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last question.\xc2\xa0 Mark Udall in the speech -- it happened while you were up there -- one thing I can tell you he said is there should be a purge of senior leadership at the CIA. What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that there should be a purge of top CIA leadership, presumably including the Director?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I spoke at length about the Director and his credentials and the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in him and the important role that he\xe2\x80\x99s played in protecting the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 The President continues to believe that the men and women of our intelligence community are dedicated professionals. These are patriots.\xc2\xa0 These are people who show up on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 They work behind the scenes and they don\xe2\x80\x99t often get the kind of recognition because of the nature of their jobs about the contribution that they make to our national security.\xc2\xa0 And the President is grateful for their work.</p>\n<p>Mr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about American moral authority around the world, and the President in one of those interviews last night said a willingness to admit mistakes is -- he held that up as an American virtue.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now you have a top U.N. official calling for prosecution.\xc2\xa0 The President also saying it\xe2\x80\x99s contrary to who we are -- this interrogation is contrary to who we are.\xc2\xa0 Is it not also contrary to American values not to prosecute those who are guilty of international crimes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say as a general matter, Mike, that the United States is committed to complying with its domestic and international obligations and we believe that the United States justice system is the appropriate place for allegations about conduct by U.S. officials to be handled.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed here at some length, there was an independent Department of Justice criminal investigation that was conducted. There have been at least two independent inspector general investigations that have been conducted and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were all the facts that were revealed in this report known to the DOJ officials?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them about their investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be looked at again in light of new information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them if there was new information that came to light.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any position on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the Department of Justice -- because the White House was not involved in the investigation they conducted -- would be able to tell you whether or not they learned anything new through the Senate report.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, following up on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s questions about John Brennan, you also have as the FBI Chief, James Comey, who served in the Bush Justice Department and helped -- he endorsed a legal memo blessing waterboarding and other enhanced techniques.\xc2\xa0 How could the President appoint John Brennan and James Comey to two of the most sensitive jobs in this administration, CIA and FBI, is he believes they endorsed un-American tactics?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I can tell you that Mr. Comey falls in the same category as Mr. Brennan in terms of somebody whose advice the President is pleased that he can rely on to keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Comey is somebody that does have a strong track record.\xc2\xa0 And there have been other instances even in his service in the previous administration where he stood up for and advocated for important civil liberties protections.\xc2\xa0 And this is somebody --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see any contradiction that you\xe2\x80\x99re attacked Bush administration policies but you have two of the architects of those policies serving?\xc2\xa0 And two of them --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair description --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- endorsing a legal memo --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is a fair description.\xc2\xa0 Certainly --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan served in the Bush administration as well.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is fair at all to describe him as an architect of those policies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t see any contradiction between them endorsing the policies that the President is attacking, and they now serve in two of the most sensitive jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Ed, is that the President of the United States has complete confidence in the professionalism of these individuals, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got complete confidence that these two individuals who serve in important leadership positions on his national security team are following the law and doing everything that is necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the President is pleased with their service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, two days ago, you very directly said that these policies did not make us safer.\xc2\xa0 Former Vice President Cheney says that\xe2\x80\x99s a crock and a bunch of hooey.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is not the first time and probably not the last time that this administration strongly disagrees with the views articulated by Vice President Cheney.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also somebody who said that deficits don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also somebody that predicted that American troops would be welcomed as liberators in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s got not a particularly strong track record when it comes to articulating a policy that this President believes is in the best interest of the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Vice President Cheney has such a weak track record on those very issues, why, as Jon said -- why does this President -- not President Bush, but this President\xe2\x80\x99s CIA Director basically agree with Dick Cheney that these tactics saved lives?<br/>\n\tYour CIA Director agrees with him.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, for questions about Mr. Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s position on these issues, I would direct you to the CIA.\xc2\xa0 They can explain them to you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he would say that he agrees wholeheartedly with Vice President Dick Cheney.\xc2\xa0 But, again, you should ask them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both say that these programs saved lives.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think their views are the same.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You have repeatedly talked about moral authority.\xc2\xa0 So can you explain how the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s un-American to use these techniques but it was okay to ramp up the drone policy and basically thousands of people around the world, innocent civilians were killed.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the moral equivalency there?\xc2\xa0 How do you have moral authority when innocent civilians are killed by drones?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the difference here, Ed -- and this is a stark difference in the way that the United States conducts our policy and the way that terrorists around the world conduct their policy -- that there is significant care taken and there are significant checks and balances that are included in the system to ensure that any counterterrorism action that\xe2\x80\x99s taken by the United States of America does not put at risk innocent lives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they do in the end.\xc2\xa0 I understand there are safeguards, but in the end, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many cases around the world where U.S. drones have killed innocent civilians, despite those safeguards.\xc2\xa0 So how do you have moral authority?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that is a stark difference from the tactics that are employed by our enemies, who seek to use car bombs to actually target innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yet you still kill civilians.\xc2\xa0 No one is defending the terrorists\xe2\x80\x99 tactics, but by your tactics --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about our moral authority, and I think there is a very clear difference.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you have moral authority if --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is a very clear difference between the tactics that are used by terrorists and the counterterrorism tactics that are employed by the United States of America that go to great lengths to protect the lives of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 In fact, many of these terrorists that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- and, again, many of these counterterrorism activities that are used against terrorists are targeting terrorists that themselves have targeted local populations, that have targeted fellow Muslims in some situations.\xc2\xa0 So the efforts that are taken by this administration to limit or to prevent innocent civilian casualties are consistent with our values and are consistent with our broader strategy for protecting the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times that Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel -- concerns -- U.S. installations around the world are on high alert right now.\xc2\xa0 Related to that, today Republican Trey Gowdy and his Benghazi committee is citing a State Department Inspector General report that says that many U.S. installations around the world, beyond the Benghazi installation, are not completely safe now and that there are real security gaps.\xc2\xa0 Agree with that?\xc2\xa0 Disagree with that?\xc2\xa0 And do you plan to have any senior officials here testify to that committee? Because previously you\xe2\x80\x99ve said if there is fair oversight on the Hill, we\xe2\x80\x99ll send people up there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Susan Rice, others -- will they testify?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The administration I think has been pretty clear about our desire to dedicate significantly more resources to ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting U.S. facilities around the globe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that there are a number of occasions where Republicans on Capitol Hill have actually blocked funding for those kinds of priorities, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have been pretty frustrated by, and I do think it raises some questions about the political motivation of some Republicans who were criticizing the administration.</p>\n<p>I will say as a general matter that the administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate oversight.\xc2\xa0 I think it remains to be seen whether the eighth inquiry into the Benghazi matter, coming on the heels of a Republican-authored report that actually absolves the administration of any involvement in the many conspiracy theories that have been floated by those on the right wing -- but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait and see whether or not there is any legitimacy to the questions that are being asked by this particular committee.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as it relates to the torture report and the findings, when there is ever something wrong, especially when it\xe2\x80\x99s relationships between this country and Islamic leaders, Islamic peoples around the world, there seems to be an outreach. Did the President reach out to the leaders of any of the countries that have a large population of Muslims there to talk to them, to apologize, to say this will never happen again, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I can tell you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m actually not in a position to read out any specific presidential conversations about the potential release of this report with other heads of state.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has an open line of communication with many world leaders, including the King of Jordan, who was just here last week.\xc2\xa0 I, frankly, don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not they discussed the impending release of this report, just because I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out any presidential conversations about this specific report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a very big issue, as when this President first came into office, he really made a point to reach out to many of the heads of these nations to say, look, we are trying to tamp down any kind of escalation of jihadist activities and to show you we\xe2\x80\x99re not the country that you may have perceived us as.\xc2\xa0 So where is this White House when it comes to possibilities of continued outreach after this report?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about the success that the United States has had and the President has had in building a broad international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Some of the members of that coalition are Muslim countries, and to have those Muslim countries working closely with the United States to go after a group like ISIL I think speaks volumes about the success that the President has had in strengthening our cooperation with regional partners as we confront this shared threat.</p>\n<p>We even have Muslim countries flying fighter jets alongside American pilots, and dropping bombs on ISIL targets in Syria, something that I think even a few months ago was, if not unthinkable, at least a proposition that many impartial observers viewed skeptically.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that these Muslim countries would ever join the United States in this effort.\xc2\xa0 But yet we have fighter pilots from the UAE and from Jordan and from other Muslim countries in the region who are flying alongside American pilots and dropping bombs on ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 That demonstrates the success that this President has had in strengthening our relationship with countries in this region -- this volatile region of the world, but also in building strong ties with other countries around the world.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also gotten significant cooperation from other more traditional allies -- allies like France, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and Denmark.\xc2\xa0 These are countries that are actually flying combat missions over the skies of Iraq, again, alongside American military pilots.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication that we have strengthened our relationship with countries in the region and around the world, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done so in a way that significantly benefits American interests around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it beyond the possibility to think that the President did or will reach out to some of these leaders for discussion and/or apology?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if he does, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that it will be the kind of conversation that we\xe2\x80\x99ll read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on Detroit, this week it\xe2\x80\x99s expected to come out of -- the city is expected to come out of bankruptcy. What do you say about that, particularly as they\xe2\x80\x99re coming out of bankruptcy and still they have a debt into the billions of dollars?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the city of -- the Obama administration has worked closely with officials in the state of Michigan and the city of Detroit as they\xe2\x80\x99ve worked through the significant financial problems plaguing that city.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are pleased that they appear to be nearing the end of this bankruptcy period, but there is significant work that remains to be done.\xc2\xa0 And the administration will continue to work closely with officials in Michigan and officials in the state of Detroit -- in the city of Detroit as they continue to recover from the significant financial problems that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that that region of the country has benefited significantly from the efforts that this President undertook to rescue the auto industry.\xc2\xa0 And again, it is thanks to the grit and determination of American workers that that industry has come roaring back, that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing record sales, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing record revenues from those companies.\xc2\xa0 And we anticipate that that will continue to have a positive economic impact on the city of Detroit and on the broader state of Michigan.</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to see the administration -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other core agencies -- working closely with city officials in Detroit to help that community recover.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you say that they\xe2\x80\x99ve come roaring back, using your words, they still, again, have this major debt --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was referring to the auto industry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s different than the city of Detroit. The financial position of the auto companies --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they are -- but the city benefits from the auto industry.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, but the city still has this major debt.\xc2\xa0 Are you still concerned?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We continue to be committed to their recovery.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, let\xe2\x80\x99s puncture some of the delicate fiction you\xe2\x80\x99ve created around the CR.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a 1,600 bill that you\xe2\x80\x99re unaware of.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a particularly charitable comment this morning.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, yowza.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a 1,600 bill that -- you know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\xc2\xa0 You negotiated with it on the Hill for two and a half weeks.\xc2\xa0 Barbara Mikulski is not a stranger to this White House.\xc2\xa0 So because it\xe2\x80\x99s the only piece of legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s operative to avoid a shutdown, just tell us the truth -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to veto it, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have not reached that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to review it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s possible you could veto it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to review the bill before we pass judgment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But nothing you\xe2\x80\x99ve said to us this morning is a discouraging word against all the things you said that are encouraging and are generally satisfying to you about this piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At the same time I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be honest about the fact that we do anticipate that there will be things in this piece of legislation that we do not like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as it becoming veto bait.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to veto it, are you?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to shut the government down.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am withholding judgment on this piece of legislation until we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to review it again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will that be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 1,600 pages long --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a factual truth, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not 1,600 pages you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about.\xc2\xa0 You know almost everything about this bill.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did work in consultation with the relevant key players, Democrat and Republican, to put this thing together, did you not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is true, but what is also true is that this is -- as somebody who covered Capitol Hill for a very long time, you understand that there are I think legitimate expectations that members of Congress have about being able to exercise their own authority to reach these kinds of agreements. So I guess the point is the White House was not at the table at every conversation.\xc2\xa0 We certainly have been kept in the loop by people on both sides, but we do not have the kind of granular knowledge about what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the legislation that members of Congress do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- one way or the other would jeopardize its passage in either chamber?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you expect it to pass?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to come to the desk, so let\xe2\x80\x99s say you\xe2\x80\x99re going to sign it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- I do not want to be in a position to predict what the House Republicans are going to do.\xc2\xa0 I do not want to be in a position of -- there are other things that I had privately thought would pass the House of Representatives that ultimately didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m withholding --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them, is it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I hope not, because we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 But hopefully they will take the action that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to prevent a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Brennan would not lie about something as important as what Jon Karl just asked you about, would he?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as somebody who -- again, as somebody who got to know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie about, would you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 As somebody who got to know Mr. Brennan when he worked here at the White House -- I had the opportunity to take a couple of trips with him when we were traveling with the President together -- and he is somebody who I think adheres to the highest ethical standard that you would expect of a government official.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason for anybody to question that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That he would lie about something like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Explain to all of us how the moral authority of the United States is advanced when there is public accountability but absolutely no judicial accountability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that -- and I mentioned this in the gaggle yesterday and I think that this bears repeating.\xc2\xa0 The President alluded to this -- actually, the Vice President alluded to this yesterday, too.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be proven wrong -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine any other country in the world going to the lengths that this country has to have a public reckoning of\xc2\xa0 -- or a public detailed accounting of our shortcomings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What that serves to do is to remind the world about how serious we are about our values; to be candid about the fact where we\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen short, to be candid about our commitment to making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go in and fix the problems that occurred -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President did in terms of announcing the reforms of our interrogation protocol and of our detention process -- and to demonstrate clearly that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s never going to happen again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that is uniquely American, in terms of our willingness to stand up for our values in that way.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody on either side of this debate -- and there is a very robust debate, and I think that there are worthy arguments to be made on either side of it -- but nobody argues about the fact that that moral authority is one of the most important elements of our arsenal in protecting the interests and the people of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And \xe2\x80\x98fessing up is sufficient to advance that moral authority?\xc2\xa0 You need not prosecute anyone?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think \xe2\x80\x98fessing up, as you described it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You described it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I did, too -- okay.\xc2\xa0 The willingness to come clean and be transparent about those shortcomings I think does a lot to rebuild our moral authority around the globe.\xc2\xa0 Aand that is why the President ended these techniques in the first place.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why he put in place these reforms that we talked about earlier, and it is why the President has strongly supported the release of this declassified version of the executive summary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of questions about benefits and costs and risks.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States and its diplomatic posts, its intelligence, its military facilities at greater risk today than it was yesterday, before the release of this report?\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the social media on the jihadist networks were crackling with outrage, indignation, and calls for either generalized attacks or specific attacks.\xc2\xa0 So are we more at risk yesterday before this report was released generally?\xc2\xa0 And is that risk worth this advancement of moral authority that you just described?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that there was an assessment that was reached by the intelligence community that U.S. facilities may be at higher risk as a result of the release of this report.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of that assessment, this administration, at the direction of the President of the United States, undertook necessary efforts to make sure that additional resources were necessary were dedicated to ensure the protection of U.S. facilities and U.S. personnel around the globe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What is also true -- so I guess the conclusion is this, is the President did decide that the benefit of releasing this report and taking a significant step to rebuild our moral authority was necessary and does, overall, strengthen our national security, and does more to protect our interests around the globe, based on the fact that we can also take the necessary steps to protect against any sort of increased risk that may occur.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the question of bin Laden and just try to clarify the comments that you made in response to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know a counterfactual -- in other words, impossible to know if you would have been able to kill bin Laden if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had these harsh interrogation tactics, if they had been outlawed at that point.\xc2\xa0 Are you essentially acknowledging that they did play a role?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging is that it is impossible for us to go back in time and determine whether or not some of the information -- about whether some of the information that those who believe that enhanced interrogation techniques yielded information that was critical to the success of the mission could have also been obtained through other measures.\xc2\xa0 It\'s possible, and unknowable, actually, whether or not that information that they say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 But then isn\xe2\x80\x99t that acknowledging that those tactics did, in fact, help lead to bin Laden --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did it play any role?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are people who are engaged in a pretty vociferous debate on both sides of this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out the possibility that it may have played -- that these harsh interrogation tactics may have played a role in finding and killing bin Laden.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging is that there are good people in both sides of that debate.\xc2\xa0 And where the President comes down on this is that, regardless of which side of that debate you\xe2\x80\x99re on, that the need to strengthen and enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount when it comes to this question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, President Obama had to have seen the intelligence when he approved the raid, so doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he have an opinion about what role this intelligence played?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President did receive an intelligence briefing in advance of the raid, but that intelligence briefing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily provide a detailed account of how that intelligence was obtained.\xc2\xa0 The point is that, again, when it comes to the Commander-in-Chief, and when it comes to making policy decisions, the President I think has spoken unequivocally about his view of this matter.</p>\n<p>It is his view that the use of these enhanced interrogation techniques does not serve our national interests, it does not make us safer because it undermines our moral authority.\xc2\xa0 And our morality authority around the globe is critically important to protecting and even advancing American interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about something that Secretary Kerry said yesterday when he was testifying.\xc2\xa0 He said that an AUMF should not prevent the use of ground troops, saying, Congress should not bind the President\xe2\x80\x99s hands when it comes to an AUMF.\xc2\xa0 Given that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan to send in ground troops, he\xe2\x80\x99s been very clear about that, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the legislation prevent the use of ground troops?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Secretary got into this.\xc2\xa0 The reason is simply this:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for us to imagine all the contingencies that could occur.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear that he does not envision a scenario where he is going to commit substantial U.S. ground troops in a combat role in Iraq or in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But as some people have pointed out, there actually is one reported instance where the President did commit ground troops in what I think everybody would describe as a combat role in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this summer, the President ordered U.S. personnel to go into Syria and to try to put boots on the ground and to try to rescue American hostages that were held in Syria.</p>\n<p>If we were to include in the AUMF a provision banning the use of combat troops, the President\xe2\x80\x99s hands would be tied and he wouldn\'t be able to order a mission like that.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we\'re seeking to avoid.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we believe that that doesn\'t constitute a responsible limitation on the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he still stands by the statement that he\xe2\x80\x99s not putting boots on the ground in this current conflict in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is absolutely correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Congress does authorize an AUMF that includes the possible use of ground troops, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop this President, the next President from engaging the United States in an ongoing, endless war?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are policy decisions that are made by the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that the President would like to see the passage of an updated, right-sized authorization to use military force that actually reflects the conflict that we\'re engaged in right now is an indication that this President is eager to move the United States away from a permanent war footing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry made reference to the fact yesterday that he supports -- that this administration continues to support the repeal of the 2002 AUMF.\xc2\xa0 The President has given at least one high-profile speech on this precise issue.\xc2\xa0 And the only thing I think that is relevant is the American people are going to have some bearing on this -- that we have a civilian in charge of our military, we have a civilian Commander-in-Chief that\'s elected by the people of the United States of America to make decisions about whether or not to take prolonged military action in a way that protects our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And we entrust the Commander-in-Chief that\'s elected by the American people to make these kinds of decisions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I guess the point is the President took office vowing to get our troops out of Iraq in a responsible way, to deal with the situation in Afghanistan and wind down our involvement in that effort, to move us off of a permanent war footing.\xc2\xa0 These are all things that the President campaigned on and was strongly supported by the American public.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the point is, those sort of what-if provisions are things that are outcomes that will at least be heavily influenced by the American public.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the way that it should be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to what you were talking about, the potential impact on American foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 If you acknowledge that the U.S. has lost moral authority, how does that impact U.S. foreign policy, especially when calling out other countries for human rights abuses?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things about that. The first is I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made substantial progress in rebuilding that moral authority since these actions were implemented.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are a couple of reasons that we can assert that.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President did take these steps in early 2009 to put in place a task force that later in 2009 announced significant reforms to the way that U.S. personnel interrogate and detain individuals that happen to be in the custody of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s notable.</p>\n<p>I think the second thing is the President was very clear in outlawing these techniques.\xc2\xa0 He was unequivocal in doing so and I do think substantially rebuilt U.S. credibility and moral authority around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And we have evidence that this effect is having an impact on our ability to protect American national security interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>If the U.S. moral authority had been substantially diminished, we would not have had so much success in building a coalition of more than 60 countries, including many Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East joining us in the fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made substantial progress, but the President believes that there is more that we\'re going to continue to do precisely because U.S. moral authority is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal for protecting and advancing American interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Russia, China, North Korea about human rights abuses.\xc2\xa0 Will we see any backing away or backing off of the condemnation of those practices in other countries?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 This administration remains as committed as ever to these basic universal human rights.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to react to the Chinese foreign ministry statement on the report that China has consistently opposed torture.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that the U.S. side should reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I could just say as a factual matter is the President, during this second full day in office, took steps to unequivocally ban the use of enhanced interrogation techniques by U.S. personnel, and he did that because he believes that it undermined our moral authority to continue to implement those techniques.\xc2\xa0 And he believed that it would make the United States stronger and safer to do so.</p>\n<p>Tamara, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great, I have a couple CR omnibus questions.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, they\'re short.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to answer them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris Van Hollen, the leading Democrat on the Budget Committee in the House, while you were speaking has announced that -- (laughter) -- you should take the Internet away from us. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t give him any ideas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s announced that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be voting against the CR omnibus because he\xe2\x80\x99s very concerned about it lifting campaign finance limits and also about the Dodd-Frank rollbacks that are in there.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any feelings about how Democrats should vote on this measure?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as always, we believe that Democrats should vote their conscience.\xc2\xa0 They should make those kinds of decisions for themselves.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s decision about whether or not to support this legislation is certainly something that he will do based on his own conscience.</p>\n<p>As the leading Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Mr. Van Hollen has more immediate and detailed knowledge of this proposal than we do here at the White House so far.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re endeavoring to review this and hope that we can have a clearer position on the specific legislation soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you have said that it\xe2\x80\x99s 1,600 pages and you\xe2\x80\x99ve only had it for 16 hours -- or not even 16 hours.\xc2\xa0 Can the President veto this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is \xe2\x80\x9cmust-pass bill\xe2\x80\x9d -- three most powerful words in Washington, possibly.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was thinking like Commander-in-Chief might be.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xc2\xa0 I might have a jaundiced perspective on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Must-pass bill can make a lot of things happen.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is true.\xc2\xa0 I concede that right away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by having so little time to review this, does the President really have an option here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President always has an option.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- as I anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend some time talking about over the next couple of years -- does have a veto power that is endowed in the presidency by the Constitution. But because this is such an important piece of legislation, it is garnering the kind of attention and thorough review that you would expect from the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had folks who literally were up very late last night and very early this morning reviewing these specific proposals and trying to understand what impact they would have on policy.</p>\n<p>So we are going to give this piece of must-pass legislation the kind of thorough detailed review that it deserves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that bad policy ever comes out of bipartisan, bicameral agreements?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Because the nature of these kinds of agreements is that they are a compromise, which means that there are things that Republicans like that are included in that Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t like; there are going to be some things the Democrats like that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t like that are included in it.\xc2\xa0 I would describe those latter things as good policy, usually.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly unbiased.</p>\n<p>But what I can tell you is that we do acknowledge that this is a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 And as Major was rightly raising, it is certainly possible that the President could sign this piece of legislation even though there are some things, maybe even many things in it that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 But we need to have a full accounting of that before we can render our judgment about whether or not the President would sign it.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that they\xe2\x80\x99re hard at work on, and we anticipate that we will be able to give you a more definitive view of that legislation soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a time frame yet, but we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly -- we\xe2\x80\x99re working on it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today would be good.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- must-pass legislation.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re hard at work on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today would be really good.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh, before you go, one more factual question about the interrogations.\xc2\xa0 Are any of those who are involved in these questionable interrogation tactics still at work for the CIA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, that\xe2\x80\x99s a question you should direct to the CIA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should they be still working for the CIA given what they did?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you should direct those questions to the CIA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:20 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
