EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining on what promises to be an exciting two-day bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m joined this morning by the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, who can answer your questions here at the top about the factsheet that you received from us this morning, chronicling the President\xe2\x80\x99s message about lowering the costs of a college education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So why don\'t we start with that?\xc2\xa0 If you have questions on other topics I can stick around to answer those.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just quickly -- and then take your questions.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just thrilled the President is focused on this.\xc2\xa0 I have to say, virtually everywhere I go -- to the dry cleaners, to the grocery store, every airplane I\'m on -- I have hardworking, middle-class parents coming up basically pleading for help, asking for help.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing sense that college is for the wealthy, for rich folks, and not for hardworking people who are doing the right thing every single day.\xc2\xa0 And at a time when going to college has never been more important, and we know the huge dividends and long-term earning potential, unfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s never been more expensive.</p>\n<p>And we have to make sure that middle-class folks, folks from struggling communities, have the chance to pursue their dreams and go on to college.\xc2\xa0 They need that security.\xc2\xa0 They need to know that\'s there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s some great things going on around the country, but we need to push very significant change.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m thrilled to have this opportunity.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Scorecard or the rating system, does the rating system itself need to get congressional approval, or just the portion that would then link the rating system to the federal financial aid?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 On the rating system, we\'re going to take some time and be really thoughtful on this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something we\'re going to do overnight.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to travel the country; the President is going to be out talking to folks.\xc2\xa0 You worry about perverse incentives or doing the wrong thing, so we\'re going to take our time on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\'m very interested in growth and gain, how much folks are improving.\xc2\xa0 So are graduation rates going up?\xc2\xa0 Are they keeping down costs?\xc2\xa0 Do young people have access to good jobs at the back end?\xc2\xa0 And I want to know -- there are some universities that are improving every year, and that\'s fantastic.\xc2\xa0 There are other places where the costs are going up far higher than the rate of inflation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So you want to look at a number of different metrics.\xc2\xa0 And I just think we need much greater transparency for the public.\xc2\xa0 This is often so hard for families to sort of navigate the chance to go to college.\xc2\xa0 We have, by far, the best system of higher education in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have 7,000 institutions of higher education.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a right choice for every child and every family.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have to get them better information, and ultimately where you see people doing the right thing, keeping costs down, serving more Pell Grant recipients, making sure graduate rates are going up -- you want to see good actors be rewarded.\xc2\xa0 You want to see them get more resources.\xc2\xa0 You want to see more students walking in their doors.\xc2\xa0 And where you are not seeing that kind of commitment you want to challenge that status quo.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you need Congress to do the first part or just the second part of it?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We need Congress to create a rating system.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do in a very public, transparent way, and want to work with Congress to do this.\xc2\xa0 This should be absolutely non-political.\xc2\xa0 We should be able to work together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We want to go out and talk to college presidents and boards and faculty members and parents and students themselves so we\'ll get a bunch of input.\xc2\xa0 But then, ultimately, what we want to do is have resources follow good actors, and we would need Congress to work in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 Some folks may say that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to do.\xc2\xa0 We just had overwhelming bipartisan support for reducing student loan interest rates.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably the most bipartisan piece of legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s passed in a long time, quite frankly.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that I\xe2\x80\x99m actually very hopeful that we can continue to work together with Congress to do that.</p>\n<p>Final thing quickly, people may not realize we at the federal level, we invest $150 billion each year in grants and loans for college.\xc2\xa0 All of that is based upon inputs just on access.\xc2\xa0 We want to focus more on outputs, and really are taxpayers, are families, are students getting good value for that important investment.</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry, yes?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, how is ultimately linking this money to what the colleges do not punishing the students for something that they have zero control over, right?\xc2\xa0 If a student wants to go to a college that has really high costs or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rank on your system very well, and all of a sudden they find that they can\xe2\x80\x99t get the aid because of something that\xe2\x80\x99s out of their control -- they can\xe2\x80\x99t control what the college does -- why is that not punishing the students?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not saying they won\xe2\x80\x99t have access to aid.\xc2\xa0 They will still have access to aid.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll look at this thing going forward, but what I would love to do is create incentives.\xc2\xa0 For example, universities that are doing a great job of accepting Pell Grant recipients but then actually graduating Pell Grant recipients, that\xe2\x80\x99s really hard work.\xc2\xa0 First-generation college goers -- we like to see those institutions get more money to do those kinds of things.</p>\n<p>So, again, folks will still have a choice, but we want to make sure that good actors are being rewarded.\xc2\xa0 The thing that\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting to me is people say we can\xe2\x80\x99t just do this, this is too hard.\xc2\xa0 Right now there is tremendous innovation going on around the country -- universities doing three-year degrees; dual enrollment with high school; doing interesting things with technology.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SUNY -- which we\'re going to visit today -- Nancy Zimpher has done a fantastic job, the chancellor at that system.\xc2\xa0 What we have to do is take these best practices to scale.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you say to people, economists who say that you\xe2\x80\x99re overstating the high cost of college, that, in fact, while costs have -- the sort of sticker price has risen, that aid has also increased as well, and that really costs have gone up by 1 or 2 percent a year?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Just look at the facts.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we have a trillion dollars in debt out there.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s too much.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the average debt has gone up to about $26,000.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s doubled over the past eight or 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And any of those things I think are not things that we should feel good or accept or think that\'s a status quo that makes sense for hardworking, middle-class families.</p>\n<p>But, again, if you look at polls of the public -- this isn\'t me -- if you look at polls, the vast -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like two-thirds of the American public think college is for the wealthy today.\xc2\xa0 There is something dramatically wrong with that picture.\xc2\xa0 Some form of higher education -- four-year universities, two-year community colleges, trade, technical vocation training -- some form of higher education training has to be the goal for every single young person in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we know the long-term economic benefits, dividends are just tremendous -- more than doubling long-term salaries.\xc2\xa0 So if you drop out of high school today, you\xe2\x80\x99re basically condemned to poverty and social failure.\xc2\xa0 There are no good jobs out there. If you have a high school diploma, there\xe2\x80\x99s almost nothing for you.\xc2\xa0 College has to be the goal, has to be the aspiration.</p>\n<p>I think what Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class Americans, are looking for is some sense of security -- if they work hard, if their children get good grades, that they should have that chance and not be burdened with huge debt at the back end.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s asking too much.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s really fair.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what kind of reaction do you expect from college presidents, colleges and universities?\xc2\xa0 And what is the effect on for-profit schools?</p>\n<p>MR. DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, I think like anything else, you\'ll get mixed reaction.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ll see people today, like Nancy Zimpher at SUNY -- and there are many college presidents around the country who are actually leading the way.\xc2\xa0 And the good ideas we\'re talking about, frankly, aren\'t my ideas or the President\'s.\xc2\xa0 These are ideas we\'re learning from university leaders who are actually doing these things, who are using technology in the first year, freshman year, to dramatically reduce costs and to increase pass rate.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re seeing people going to three-year programs and doing really creative things to drive down the cost very substantially.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this good work is out there.\xc2\xa0 There are others where they will be more resistant.\xc2\xa0 And again, they can keep doing what they want; we just want a lot more transparency and we want parents and students to have access to know this university\'s tuition is going up 10 percent every year; this university has held tuition for the past five years and increased graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s really valuable information to have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On for-profits, again, whether it\'s non-profit, for-profit, private, public, the President has challenged us to lead the world in college graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 And we just want to support good actors in every sector.\xc2\xa0 We want good actors to grow and thrive and have more students, more people walking in their doors.\xc2\xa0 Where folks are taking advantage of young people not doing a good job, that\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One other quick thing -- when I led the Chicago Public Schools, we tracked our high school graduates very closely.\xc2\xa0 It was fascinating.\xc2\xa0 We saw high school graduates with identical GPAs, identical test scores, go to different local universities\xc2\xa0 -- some had like 80 percent graduation rates; others had like 40 and 50 -- huge swings.\xc2\xa0 So very frankly, we started to steer our graduates towards certain universities who built a culture not just on access but around completion, and away from other places. There\xe2\x80\x99s that kind of transparency that we think is really important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the for-profit colleges.\xc2\xa0 It seems like if you\'re going to tie financial aid to getting a diploma that this is sort of an end run around what you all tried to do earlier in the administration to for-profit colleges.</p>\n<p>MR. DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s simply not correct.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not factually correct.\xc2\xa0 And, again, where for-profits are doing a great job of getting folks who are struggling, getting them skills for the new economy -- green energy, advanced manufacturing, IT health -- where they\'re doing that, and people are going back into the world of work and strengthening their family, we think that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic.\xc2\xa0 We hope they grow and prosper and get many more students.</p>\n<p>Where someone is providing an education that really isn\'t leading to real employment opportunities, where you\'re taking on massive debt and ending up in a worse financial situation than when you started, that\'s not something, again, that we should feel proud of.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a very poor use of taxpayer money, and it\'s not really fair to that individual who\xe2\x80\x99s trying to climb the economic ladder.</p>\n<p>If we want to build a growing and thriving middle class, the only way to do that is to open the door to higher education, to make it more accessible, more affordable, make sure folks are graduating and have a chance to earn a good living.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what this is about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, how much of what the President is going to outline that requires legislative approval do you hope to see incorporated in the five-year higher education reauthorization?\xc2\xa0 And how much might be on a separate legislative track?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll figure that out, so we\'re not sure on which track.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\'ve worked -- I hope you know everything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to do in education is on a non-political basis.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just trying to help.\xc2\xa0 Again, our North Star is leading the world in college graduation rates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And one generation ago, the United States led the world in college graduation rates; today, we\'re like 12th or 13th.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a badge of honor.\xc2\xa0 Other countries are out-educating us.\xc2\xa0 And those countries that are out-educating us, they\'re going to out-innovate us.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to have the good jobs flow to those countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I want to keep good, high-wage, high-skilled jobs in this country.\xc2\xa0 We should work on a bipartisan basis, as we have done I think, again, very effectively, to make sure that dream of going to going to college for the middle class, that sense of security, we get back to that and provide greater opportunity.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we talk about a couple of other issues, since we\'re about to land?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing -- any thoughts of stepping down from being Secretary of Education soon?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 (Shakes his head no.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, any updates on the U.S. policy on aid?\xc2\xa0 And has the President had any other similar high-level meetings since the one on Tuesday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any additional meetings to read out to you on this.\xc2\xa0 This is the subject of ongoing conversation at the White House, of course, but no additional high-level meetings like the one the President had I think two days ago now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Phone calls?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No phone calls to read out and no change in terms of our ongoing review of our aid and assistance relationship with Egypt.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction about Mubarak?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I got asked about this a couple of days ago.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter that\'s being -- winding its way through the Egyptian legal system.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific comment on each step in that process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say that the revolution from 2011 in Egypt is still fresh in the minds of the Egyptian people and there is little desire/evidence on the part of the Egyptian people that they want to turn back the clock to the Mubarak regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is why the United States stands with the Egyptian people as they seek a government that reflects their will.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why we\'re working with the interim government to encourage them to go back to a transition to a democratically elected civilian government, and overall, an inclusive political process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can we expect to hear from the President at all about the situation in Syria with regards to the reports of chemical weapons?\xc2\xa0 And was there any pause given at all to whether the optics are good of going on a bus trip today to talk about education when that bloodshed is happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take those as two separate questions.\xc2\xa0 The first thing I\'ll say is the United States is appalled by reports of widespread civilian killings in Syria that were reported just a couple of nights ago.\xc2\xa0 The images that we\'ve seen are nothing short of horrifying.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the senior administration officials have been in touch with their counterparts around the world to coordinate on our response.\xc2\xa0 There was some consultation at the United Nations Security Council yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what is true today is something that was true yesterday, which is that there is a U.N. chemical weapons investigative team on the ground in Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 You have an Assad regime that denies responsibility for the use of these chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 The easiest way for them to demonstrate that they are on the side of the international community in opposition to the use of chemical weapons is to allow this U.N. team full access to the site to try to get to the bottom of what happened.</p>\n<p>That means allowing them to interview witnesses.\xc2\xa0 That means allowing them to collect physical samples.\xc2\xa0 And that allows them unfettered access to the region so that they can do their work.\xc2\xa0 And we renew our call for the Assad regime to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of the bus tour, this is a -- seeking a better bargain for the middle class is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s. It is critical, as you heard Secretary Duncan say, to the long-term success of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99re weighing these domestic policy decisions, and as we\xe2\x80\x99re weighing these foreign policy decisions, the President puts the interest of the United States of America first.</p>\n<p>And I think the fact that we are doing this bus tour is an indication that the President has his priorities straight while he continues to monitor what is an increasingly tragic situation in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One domestic policy question -- reports by a colleague of mine that Republicans in the House are considering linking the debt ceiling negotiations or the budget negotiations to some leverage over Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The reaction is that those comments are disappointing but hardly surprising.\xc2\xa0 We have seen Republican members of Congress and their advisors repeatedly suggest that the full faith and credit of the United States is a useful point of leverage for them to accomplish a political goal.</p>\n<p>Setting aside the fact that that political goal is denying access to health care coverage to millions of Americans, it\xe2\x80\x99s just wrong.\xc2\xa0 The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not a bargaining chip.\xc2\xa0 And it is the responsibility of the Congress to pass legislation that will allow them to pay the bills that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already racked up.\xc2\xa0 They should do that without drama and without delay when they return from the August recess.</p>\n<p>Anything else?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:12 A.M.
