EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I brought a special guest to discuss with you the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming trip to Africa. \xc2\xa0Susan Rice is the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor. \xc2\xa0She has her own extensive personal experience in dealing with policy in Africa, and she obviously will be accompanying the President on that trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make some opening remarks at the top. \xc2\xa0And what I would like to do is to try to take as many questions on the Africa trip to satisfy your interest and hear directly from Ambassador Rice on those issues. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s agreed to stick around and take a couple of questions on other topics as well. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll just try to keep it moving.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut let\xe2\x80\x99s do the Africa questions first. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a little stage management here, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Susan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you, Eric. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Thank you, gentlemen. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everyone. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you. \xc2\xa0As we prepare to depart for Africa -- and I know many of you may be leaving as early as later today -- I wanted to take the opportunity to give you a preview of what you can expect. \xc2\xa0First, some general points.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, President Obama, tomorrow evening, will travel to Kenya and Ethiopia for bilateral meetings, for additional meetings at the African Union, and he will attend as well the Global Entrepreneurship Summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s fourth trip to Africa -- the most of any sitting American President. \xc2\xa0It will also be the first time that a sitting American President travels to Kenya, the first time a sitting American President travels to Ethiopia, and the first time a sitting American President addresses the African Union.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe upcoming travel will go a long distance, as well, to advance our trade and investment relationship with Africa, as well as our continued work to help African governments strengthen their business environment and their capacity for regional and global trade.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn this regard, the President will lift up the recent 10-year renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which we\xe2\x80\x99ll also celebrate here tonight at the White House. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll note what a strong signal that sends to our African partners that we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about expanding and sustaining U.S.-Africa trade, including by helping to create new customers for U.S. businesses overseas.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCongress\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for this legislation allowed us to secure AGOA\xe2\x80\x99s renewal. \xc2\xa0And the President, as he has on past trips, has invited a number of House and Senate members to join him. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re cognizant that Africa\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth will support increased demand for U.S. exports, which, in turn, will help create U.S. jobs at home, and provide valuable investment opportunities for American businesses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re intensifying our efforts to create an environment that enables greater trade and investment through encouraging regional integration, legal reforms that allow for the free flow of goods and services, greater transparency, and anti-corruption measures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will highlight our continued efforts to support young African leaders, as well as to increase access to electricity, to deepen our partnerships on food security and global health, which are delivering results by reducing hunger and under-nutrition, improving child survival, and helping move people out of poverty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will also stress the importance of strong, democratic institutions, respect for the rule of law, fighting corruption, and our support for open and accountable governance, and respect for human rights across the continent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis trip is an opportunity to voice strong support for the vital role played by civil society, as well as to call attention to other important issues, such as the global campaign to combat wildlife trafficking and to stress the importance of equal opportunities for women and girls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a couple minutes discussing the themes for each stop, before running through the itinerary. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to his time in Kenya, the President will honor the strong, historical ties between the United States and Kenya. \xc2\xa0Choosing Kenya as the destination for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit underscores the fact that the United States -- excuse me, that Africa, and Kenya in particular, has become a center for innovation and entrepreneurship. \xc2\xa0The Global Entrepreneurship Summit will highlight the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to promoting entrepreneurship globally, particularly opportunities for women and girls. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur time in Kenya will also underscore Nairobi\xe2\x80\x99s strong leadership on regional security issues, its impressive record of economic growth and competitive democratic system, as well as the challenges that Kenya obviously still faces in countering violent extremism, ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs we move on to Ethiopia, the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit will reflect the fact that we have a longstanding, strong bilateral relationship with Ethiopia. \xc2\xa0Among our shared interests are facilitating peace in South Sudan, countering al-Shabaab in Somalia, and advancing Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s growth and development, as well as promoting regional stability.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd just as we work closely together in many arenas, we also regularly conveyed to Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s leadership our concerns in such areas as press freedom, transparency, space for civil society, and the political opposition. \xc2\xa0So this trip is also an opportunity for to continue our frank discussions and to urge progress in these areas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhile in Ethiopia, the President will meet with the leadership of the African Union, and speak to the whole continent from the African Union headquarters. \xc2\xa0The African Union is a leader on a broad array of global issues, including peace and security, health and agriculture. \xc2\xa0And we have come to work very closely with the African Union on this broad spectrum of issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFinally, this trip comes a year after the historic U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which resulted in $33 billion in new commitments to support trade and investment across Africa, as well as tangible U.S. and African efforts to improve security, promote human rights and good governance, and provide opportunities for Africa\xe2\x80\x99s sizeable youth population.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur upcoming engagements will advance our trade and investment relationship with Africa, as well as our continued work to help African governments strengthen their business environments and capacity for regional and global trade.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo before I take your questions, let me just tell you a little bit about each day on the trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Saturday, the 25th of July, the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip will start in earnest on Saturday morning, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll open up the 6th Annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit co-hosted by the U.S. and Kenya. \xc2\xa0I expect the President will have an opportunity also to pay tribute to the victims and the survivors of the 1998 embassy bombings, which targeted our embassy not only in Nairobi, but also in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSaturday, the Kenyan government will host the President for a bilateral program, including a meeting and press conference and state dinner. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Sunday, the President will deliver remarks to the Kenyan people. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have additional details on the thrust of his remarks in the coming days. \xc2\xa0But you can expect him to speak to the broad themes in our relationship with Kenya and its people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will also take part in a civil society event to highlight civil society\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to development, prosperity and democratic institutions in Kenya. \xc2\xa0And he will open the event with remarks and engage in a discussion with civil society participants, primarily around the topics of wildlife trafficking, girls\xe2\x80\x99 education, and countering violent extremism. \xc2\xa0And late in the day on Sunday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll head to Ethiopia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, in Ethiopia, the President will take part again in a bilateral program with the government of Ethiopia, including an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings with the President and the Prime Minister, as well as a press conference with the Ethiopian Prime Minister and a state dinner. \xc2\xa0I also expect that the President will take part in a summit meeting with a handful of regional leaders on shared priorities, particularly the crisis in South Sudan and regional counterterrorism issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, our final day, the President will participate in a civil society roundtable, and he will speak before the African Union, which, as you know, is headquartered in Addis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will hold a bilateral meeting with the chairwoman of the African Union Commission and during that day will also have the opportunity to highlight some of our sustainable development initiatives, including in food security, as well as the work we\'re doing to deepen economic and trade cooperation with Ethiopia in the broader region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo obviously this will be a busy several days, but we -- the President, his entire national security team -- are very much looking forward to the opportunity to build on the momentum from last year\xe2\x80\x99s African Leaders Summit and to advance our strong and growing ties with the African continent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, let me take a few questions on the Africa trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Chris, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0And thanks for doing this, Susan. \xc2\xa0As you know, when the President was elected, there was a lot of high expectations raised about what the President could do for the African continent and Kenya, in particular. \xc2\xa0And there are a lot of people -- and much has been written about the fact that he has not realized those expectations. \xc2\xa0And I wonder how you would respond to that. \xc2\xa0They say -- they often refer to what President Bush did in terms of AIDS being transformative that this President has not yet done anything transformative. \xc2\xa0How would you respond to that? \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of this trip in terms of the overall picture of him and the final legacy he will have in terms of his relationship with the African continent?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, Chris, let me say that President Obama is building on what has been a strong bipartisan tradition of U.S. support for Africa. \xc2\xa0I recall back to the Clinton administration when President Clinton was the first President to take a trip that was broad-ranging and covered the African continent. \xc2\xa0We have been steadily building -- including through the Bush administration with President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s obvious strong commitment to Africa -- a foundation that is growing. \xc2\xa0And each brick is layered on the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPresident Obama, obviously, has been unique. \xc2\xa0First of all, this will be his fourth trip to Africa, more than any other sitting President. \xc2\xa0Never before had we had an African Leaders Summit with the leadership from across the entirety of the continent here in Washington for several days, engaging in the most important issues of concern between us. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe trade and investment relationship between the United States and Africa has never been stronger. \xc2\xa0Never have we had $33 billion in U.S. commitments driven by public-private partnerships, which this administration has galvanized. \xc2\xa0The food security initiative, Feed the Future, and the new Alliance for Food Security are Obama administration initiatives that we launched at the G7 and have pursued in partnership with our G7 -- at that time G8 -- partners, which have brought unprecedented new agricultural opportunities and growth to the African continent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have built on PEPFAR, President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s initiative in the AIDS space, to launch and sustain a global health initiative both in Africa and then broadly a global health security initiative, which was something we started before the Ebola epidemic, but now we\'re pursuing both in Africa and around the world, which will bring increased ability to detect and prevent epidemics and bring health to the people of Africa. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAcross the spectrum, we are building and deepening our relationship with Africa. \xc2\xa0Power Africa, which like PEPFAR, is building up in strength and capacity, will double the amount of power to the African continent. \xc2\xa0This is going to take time, as PEPFAR did. \xc2\xa0But it will be itself a very transformative initiative. \xc2\xa0And when combined with the programs I\xe2\x80\x99ve described in the health sector and the agriculture sector and trade and investment, I think President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s record on Africa will not only match that of his predecessors, but I predict with confidence we\xe2\x80\x99ll exceed it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ambassador Rice, I have a couple of questions to ask you. \xc2\xa0For Kenya and Ethiopia, particularly on issues of human rights, there are concerns about human rights issues when it comes to peaceful assembly in Ethiopia as well as silencing journalists and bloggers. \xc2\xa0And then when we talk about Kenya, Kenya in particular with the issue of same-sex couples, how is the President approaching these human rights issues as he travels and makes this historic visit? \xc2\xa0And also, on a personal note, you\xe2\x80\x99ve known this President since he was Senator Barack Obama and you know personally his story. \xc2\xa0Does this trip for him bring him full circle? \xc2\xa0And I speak of traveling to Kenya and thinking of the book \xe2\x80\x9cDreams of My Father\xe2\x80\x9d, thinking about his real-life story and going home to -- well, going to his father\xe2\x80\x99s home of Kenya. \xc2\xa0And basically, does he make peace with his life story with his father? \xc2\xa0I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you because you know him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get me to psychoanalyze the President? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0How dumb do I look, April? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not at all, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0For free, yes. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Let me address your first question first. \xc2\xa0I think as you all know well, we go to many places in Asia and Africa and the Middle East where we engage with countries and leaders with whom we have some questions and concerns about their human rights record, their respect for democracy and the rule of law. \xc2\xa0So there is nothing unique about this in the African context, but what is consistent is that wherever we go, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in Africa or elsewhere in the world where we have such concerns, we raise them directly and clearly, both in public and in private. \xc2\xa0And we will do that as we always do when we visit Kenya and Ethiopia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEach of these are different countries with different contexts. \xc2\xa0Obviously, in Ethiopia in particular, we have consistently expressed concern about the treatment of journalists, among other issues. \xc2\xa0We noted that recently the Ethiopian government did release five journalists, which is a welcome step but they have a long way to go. \xc2\xa0And I think we have been very clear in our dialogue with them on this and other issues related to democracy and governance that we believe they can and should do more and better. \xc2\xa0And we look forward to engaging with them on this topic and similarly with the concerns that you raise that are specific to Kenya. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut both these countries are very important longstanding U.S. partners with whom we have a broad range of issues, not just in the governance -- in the interests, not just issues. \xc2\xa0But in the governance space and the security space, in the economic space, we have a lot that we can do and are doing cooperatively and productively with these countries, and our aim is to be forthright about the concerns where we have them and strengthen and deepen cooperation in our mutual interests where we can. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ll approach it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI won\xe2\x80\x99t speak for the President. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from him during the course of the trip about his personal ties to Kenya. \xc2\xa0I do know that he is very much looking forward to both the stops on this trip. \xc2\xa0And obviously when you go to a country where you have familial ties and you\xe2\x80\x99re a sitting President, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different deal than when you\xe2\x80\x99re going as a private citizen or even as a United States senator. \xc2\xa0So there are certain constraints not only of time but of logistics that limit what he might do in a different context. \xc2\xa0But I\'m quite confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to the trip and the opportunity to spend some time in private with some of his relatives. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Anita.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0I\'m actually just going to follow up on that. \xc2\xa0You said he would be spending some time with relatives. \xc2\xa0Can you just expand on that? \xc2\xa0Will they come visit him? \xc2\xa0Will he go somewhere? \xc2\xa0Will he go to his family\xe2\x80\x99s village? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the bear be on the loose? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to get into details on the logistics except to say that I do believe he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to spend some time privately with members of his family. \xc2\xa0I think some members of his family will also be invited to some of the public events, or the larger state-sponsored events, including perhaps the dinner. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is a fact that he is not going to be able to visit the village most closely associated with his family for a combination of time and logistical reasons, among others. \xc2\xa0But nonetheless, I know that he looks forward to having the opportunity to reach out to and have some time with family, as any of us would.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Suzanne.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s come to light that Kenyan Airlines has actually published the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in detail regarding the two major airports, both arrival and departure, not only among its staff but also it\xe2\x80\x99s been published on Facebook. \xc2\xa0Is this a breach in security protocol? \xc2\xa0Is there any concern about security measures in light of this kind of widespread information that is now out to the public regarding very specifically his schedule?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0My understanding, Suzanne, is that Secret Service is well aware of this. \xc2\xa0It has in no way affected our approach to or plans for the trip. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s also my understanding that oftentimes some of this information turns out to be not entirely accurate. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it in any way is disturbing our plans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Christi.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0A question on timing. \xc2\xa0Kenya obviously is a place of great personal significance for the President. \xc2\xa0For reasons that you\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged already, there were reasons not to go prior to now. \xc2\xa0But I just wonder if you can talk a little bit about why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go before now, why he is going now. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the reason? \xc2\xa0Why is this a good time to go?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going now because we are the co-chair of the 6th Annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit which Kenya is hosting. \xc2\xa0So every year there is such a summit; the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to make every one of them but he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to several. \xc2\xa0The Vice President has gone to some. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so this is an opportunity not only to support the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which is something the President is deeply committed to as an initiative that has resonance around the world, but it\'s also an opportunity to strengthen and deepen our relationship to Africa -- which, as we discussed with Chris, has been a centerpiece of the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was he waiting for the ICC charges against President Kenyatta to be resolved before he took his trip?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I think, Christi, the real hook for the timing was the entrepreneurship summit. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he appear or meet with the deputy who still is facing charges before the ICC?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has any plans for any separate engagements with him. \xc2\xa0He is a member of the government, so I imagine that he may be present at some of the events.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Isaac.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you speak a little bit more broadly to the security concerns on this trip? \xc2\xa0Are they higher than normal for a presidential trip, given the countries that he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting and the situation like this? \xc2\xa0And also, to just follow up on what Christi was saying, does the President consider the presidents of Kenya and Ethiopia democratically-elected Presidents?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0First of all, you mean -- okay, let me come to the second one. \xc2\xa0The short answer is, on the security side, Isaac, I think I should refer you to Secret Service for any detailed questions. \xc2\xa0But obviously we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking this trip if we thought that security conditions precluded us doing so. \xc2\xa0But it is important to note that Kenya in particular -- Ethiopia less recently -- has been the victim of terrorism, primarily perpetrated by al-Shabaab. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are very concerned for the people of Kenya and for the region, that this threat remains a real one. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve cooperated so actively not only with the African Union force in Somalia, which is countering al-Shabaab, but also in a bilateral way with the government of Kenya, the government of Ethiopia, and Uganda and others in the region that have experienced the threat from al-Shabaab.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s something that obviously, given their history and given the strong counterterrorism cooperation we have with the countries in the region, that we take seriously.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe democrat role -- first of all, yes, I think we would say that the President of Kenya was democratically elected. \xc2\xa0That was a competitive process. \xc2\xa0I think the Prime Minister of Ethiopia was just elected with 100 percent of the vote, which I think suggests, as we have stated in our public statements, some concern for the integrity of the electoral process -- at least if not in the outcomes then in some of the mechanisms that supported the process, the freedom for the opposition to campaign.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is that -- but does he think that that was a democratic election?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Isaac -- 100 percent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.

EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Toluse. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned South Sudan a couple of times, and I wanted to ask about that. \xc2\xa0The U.S. has invested a lot of money over the last decade in the peace process between Sudan and South Sudan. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to sort of seeing things fall so far into disrepair there? \xc2\xa0And what can the President do specifically during this trip to address that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously all of us who celebrated the independence of South Sudan after a very long-fought struggle are deeply disappointed. \xc2\xa0And I have personally said I\xe2\x80\x99m heartbroken by the horrific violence and civil conflict and human rights abuses that have characterized South Sudan in the last 18 months. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have worked long and hard in partnership with the countries in the region to try to broker a lasting peace agreement in South Sudan. \xc2\xa0Thus far, the sides have put their own personal power and wealth ahead of the interests of their people and have refused to accept numerous rational proposals for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s for that reason that when the President has the opportunity to meet with a handful of leaders in Addis, in a summit format, that South Sudan will be among the important topics that they take up, including what more we can do at this critical moment as the circumstances on the ground continue to deteriorate to galvanize a peaceful outcome and to hold the leaders accountable on both sides. \xc2\xa0And should it prove impossible to get them to come to an agreement, we will be talking about what other steps we might take collectively to impose consequences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one more. \xc2\xa0Do you expect the President to interact with Robert Mugabe while he is in --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.

EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ambassador, you addressed already a little bit of the issue of human rights. \xc2\xa0Some aid groups have said that a presidential trip gives the White House a lot of leverage to press Ethiopia and Kenya on rights. \xc2\xa0Do you feel you\xe2\x80\x99ve used that leverage? \xc2\xa0And do you expect any additional announcements of journalist release or other things along those lines from the Ethiopian government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for the Ethiopian government, Jeff. \xc2\xa0I can say that we always -- not just in Africa, but around the world -- when we are traveling to countries where we have concerns about the rule of law, human rights, corruption, whatever, democratic governance, we make those concerns known, publicly and privately. \xc2\xa0And we have done so continuously in the case of these two countries, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so. \xc2\xa0I think our interest is not in some gesture necessarily tied to the trip but in lasting change, which is sustained over time that benefits the people of these countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of astounding that no American President has visited Kenya before now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE. \xc2\xa0Sitting, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sitting President. \xc2\xa0How do you --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Or Ethiopia, which is the largest -- one of the largest countries in East Africa and on the continent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you hear a lot about the historic relationship between the U.S. and Kenya. \xc2\xa0So what can you say about why that is that no one --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t Bill Clinton go? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why we didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Ethiopia or Kenya. \xc2\xa0I think one strong thing about Ethiopia that was less the case back then is the African Union, which back then was the Organization of African Unity, has come into its own and become a very strong force for unity and progress, frankly, on the continent. \xc2\xa0And so our partnership with the African Union has definitely strengthened and deepened. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been under this administration that we appointed an ambassador to the African Union. \xc2\xa0And in many ways, the strength and importance of that relationship has changed. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve always had an interest in Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s progress, particularly after the end of the Derg. \xc2\xa0And we had Secretaries of State in the Clinton administration who went to Ethiopia and to Kenya, of course. \xc2\xa0But we did not have the opportunity for President Clinton to go. \xc2\xa0He took two trips to Africa, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall. \xc2\xa0First one in 1998, where he went to I think six countries, and then a subsequent one where he -- it was a shorter trip where he just went to two.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Steve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to come back to the lawmakers for a moment. \xc2\xa0Do you see these invitations to them as a way to advance your policy goals on Africa? \xc2\xa0And what specifically might you be asking Congress to do in the area of Africa legislation in the coming months?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously we want to strengthen and sustain what I\xe2\x80\x99ve referred to repeatedly as a strong bipartisan consensus around support for Africa, Africa\xe2\x80\x99s development, peace and security there. \xc2\xa0The biggest piece of legislation that we were focused on related to Africa was, of course, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which was renewed last month in the context of other trade legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut obviously we have many, many issues that are important that we need Congress\xe2\x80\x99s support on -- legislation that will support and codify some of the most significant initiatives, including in the health and agriculture and power sectors, as well as we have a nominee on the Hill that very much needs to be confirmed for USAID administrator. \xc2\xa0So that is not something solely for Africa, it\xe2\x80\x99s for the whole world, and for our leadership as the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest provider of humanitarian assistance at a time when the world is having many humanitarian crises. \xc2\xa0But there are many, many ways in which Congress\xe2\x80\x99s role is necessary to, and contributes to, on a bipartisan basis our support for Africa and other developing parts of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Suzanne, why don\'t you do one last Africa one, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll probably take one more and then I got to let Susan go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was just yesterday that Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s President said that gay rights was a non-issue in his country, and that it was definitely on the agenda with the President. \xc2\xa0It was two years ago in Senegal, President Obama was very forceful about protecting gay rights. \xc2\xa0There are already warnings from inside Kenya from politicians, media outlets, for the President not to address it as bluntly or as openly as he did before. \xc2\xa0Is it on the agenda? \xc2\xa0Is it something that he is thinking about in terms of the balance between recognizing the sovereignty of Kenya and also promoting gay rights?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, Suzanne, I think, as you know, this is not for us an issue of Africa or any country in Africa, this is an issue of universal human rights. \xc2\xa0And President Obama feels very strongly, as do all of us in the administration, that gay rights are human rights. \xc2\xa0And whether we\'re in Washington, D.C. or in somewhere in Asia or in Africa, that is something that we do not shy away from underscoring, as the President did during his last trip to Africa, and many other parts of the world. \xc2\xa0So this is not something that we think is a topic we reserve for certain parts of the world and not others. \xc2\xa0If appropriate, I have no doubt that the President will feel perfectly free to raise his concerns.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Cuba, Ambassador Rice, if I could. \xc2\xa0I know the NSC has been a driving force in this new relationship, and I was wondering -- there are three things I would like to ask you about. \xc2\xa0The first is, were you surprised at all by the Foreign Minister\xe2\x80\x99s sort of aggressive stance while he was here, the Foreign Minister of Cuba, when he, standing next to John Kerry at the State Department, pressed on the issue of Guantanamo Bay and the embargo against Cuba in that setting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber two, is Guantanamo Bay -- Guantanamo Naval Air Station still, in this period of time, important to the United States as far as national security? \xc2\xa0Is it something that is non-negotiable because it\xe2\x80\x99s important to our military?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd third, I wanted to ask you about Radio and TV Mart\xc3\xad, which is still spending millions of dollars putting out anti-Castro articles. \xc2\xa0In fact, I saw two today against Castro -- anti-Castro -- when President Obama said in Panama, when you were there, that we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer in the business of regime change. \xc2\xa0Is that a waste of money, and is that contradictory to what our current foreign policy is?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, I think the unifying theme of your questions is, has everything changed overnight or not? \xc2\xa0And I think the answer is, look, we have made a historic change in the nature of our diplomatic relationship with Cuba. \xc2\xa0I think if I\xe2\x80\x99d been here a year and a half ago having this discussion, few of you would have envisioned that we\xe2\x80\x99d be talking about the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. \xc2\xa0So obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s been an important milestone, and we think it is the right thing to advance our mutual interest, as well as our deep interest in the evolution of democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that everything has changed overnight. \xc2\xa0And the issues that have been irritant in the bilateral relationship up and until now have miraculously gone away? \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0So it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, frankly, surprise me that the Foreign Minister would reprise some themes that are frequent themes of him and other prominent Cuban diplomats, including the disposition of Guantanamo and their opposition to the embargo.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen I was up in New York as U.N. Ambassador, those were themes that I became very accustomed to hearing, and so maybe they are a bit more familiar to me than they are to others. \xc2\xa0But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re not, at this stage, at all interested in changing the nature of our understanding and arrangements on Guantanamo. \xc2\xa0And they may choose to raise it, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been equally clear that, for us, that\xe2\x80\x99s not in the offing at the present. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with respect to TV Mart\xc3\xad, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s in the same vein. \xc2\xa0We will -- we have and we will continue to say and do what we think is appropriate to advance our interests in human rights and democracy in Cuba. \xc2\xa0And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise us if -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to change just because the Cuban government may wish that we did otherwise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One on Iran? \xc2\xa0A pair of Republican lawmakers, Senator Cotton of Arkansas and Congressman Pompeo of Kansas, each a member of his chamber\xe2\x80\x99s Armed Service Committee, have released a press release in which they allege that in their recent visit last week to Vienna and to the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency, they were told directly by IAEA officials that two so-called side deals were forged with Iran by the agency, relating to inspections at Parchin and to the resolution of still other questions surrounding the possible military dimension to the Iranian nuclear program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tA, are you aware of any side deals between Iran and the IAEA? \xc2\xa0And B, are there any codicils, side deals, annexes, pieces of paper, documents, understandings that were forged as part of these talks and the final agreement that are not being share with the United States, the American people, or the Congress? \xc2\xa0Any deals at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0So let me be very clear: \xc2\xa0From our vantage point, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, this is a good and strong deal that will verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And we think it serves our interest and that of the region and the international community. \xc2\xa0And when Congress has the opportunity to review it in detail, we think that they will come to the same rational conclusion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, we have provided Congress with all of the documents that we drafted or were part of drafting, and all documents that have been shared with us by the IAEA. \xc2\xa0So there is nothing that we are holding in our possession that we had either any role in crafting or were given to us that has not been given to Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the issue of PMD -- possible military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no secret. \xc2\xa0Iran and the IAEA, as is the custom and is the expectation -- this has always been an issue between Iran and the IAEA -- negotiated and concluded an agreement to deal with this issue of PMD, which was one of the major sticking points in our dealings with Iran in the context of the P5+1. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall there was some question as to whether this issue would be adequately addressed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe IAEA and Iran did reach an understanding. \xc2\xa0As is always the case, that is an understanding between the country in question and the IAEA. \xc2\xa0These documents are not public. \xc2\xa0But, nonetheless, we have been briefed on those documents. \xc2\xa0We know their contents. \xc2\xa0We\'re satisfied with them. \xc2\xa0And we will share the contents of those briefings in full in classified session with the Congress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in that regard that we know that they won\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Bob, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, then Susan has got to go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Madam Ambassador, let me ask you a gut question now. \xc2\xa0You spent how many weeks in Vienna offhand, other places negotiating this deal. \xc2\xa0What is it like when you hear a lot of Republicans up on Capitol Hill wholesale ripping it apart?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, frankly, I didn\'t, myself, spend all those weeks in Vienna. \xc2\xa0Out of deference to those who did, I don\'t want to claim that same badge of honor. \xc2\xa0But, in seriousness, obviously we were all working very intently on this. \xc2\xa0This is a good deal. \xc2\xa0It does what we set out to do. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s recall what the objective was. \xc2\xa0The objective was, if possible, through negotiations, to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0That was the critical threat from the United States\xe2\x80\x99 point of view that we were most concerned about. \xc2\xa0That\'s what Israel maintained was an existential threat to Israel and countries around the world were agreed on was the priority. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo against that backdrop we painstakingly built a sanctions regime over many, many years that involved the entirety of the international community to put unprecedented economic and other pressure on Iran with the express aim of getting Iran to the negotiating table, and if we could get Iran to the negotiating table, to use that economic pressure to obtain a verifiable, strong agreement that prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0That\'s exactly what we did. \xc2\xa0So the goal was set; the means were put in place; the outcome was achieved.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd to the extent that people may have questions or concerns about particular aspects of the deal, we are at their disposal to address them. \xc2\xa0But as somebody who has been thick in this and studied it very carefully and participated in its creation, we could not have reasonably achieved through the imposition of sanctions and diplomacy a more effective means of preventing Iran verifiably from achieving a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is unprecedented transparency, unprecedented inspections, 24/7 monitoring of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear facilities, the dismantling of their heavy-water facility at Arak, the reduction by 98 percent of their uranium stockpile, two-thirds of their centrifuges are gone -- and all in the context of the United States and the international community having full knowledge and transparency about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s, in our view, the definition of what we set out to accomplish, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gratified that that deal has been achieved.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But do you think some Republicans just aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to give it a chance?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. RICE: \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you psychoanalyze the President? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I certainly will not do that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo to the extent that anybody has any more questions, I\'m happy to do some of them. \xc2\xa0So, Darlene, do you want to get us started?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just have a couple quick ones. \xc2\xa0The President is meeting soon with some business people that have been affected by the lapse Ex-Im Bank. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell has floated the idea of attaching the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s reauthorization to the six-year highway bill that was agreed to this week. \xc2\xa0Would the White House support that approach?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene, the President, as you know, has been a strong advocate of ensuring that Congress acts quickly to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThose who are more sophisticated observers of Congress informed me that the most likely vehicle to move through Congress next is the extension of the transportation funding. \xc2\xa0And that is why the administration does support whatever transportation vehicles moves that it include legislation that would reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s ample reason to make this a priority. \xc2\xa0The President will talk about that a little bit later this afternoon, but it has been strongly supported by the past 13 Presidents, both Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0And just last year, the Ex-Im Bank actually supported 164,000 American jobs. \xc2\xa0And on average, jobs that are supported by exports pay about 18 percent more. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that Ex-Im makes a substantial and important contribution to our economy. \xc2\xa0And the President is urging Congress to act quickly to reauthorize it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then on the group of lawmakers who are traveling on the Africa trip -- I know you told Byron that a list would be provided tomorrow.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say how big a group is? \xc2\xa0I mean, 10, 15, 20 lawmakers? \xc2\xa0Any members of leadership among them, or is it just rank and file?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding is that it\xe2\x80\x99s more than a dozen, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a sizeable contingent. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have those names available tomorrow. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Some of the names are already being released by some of the congressional leaders. \xc2\xa0Could you give us some at least?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0It sounds like they are, though.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a follow-up as well on the highway bill. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Senate highway bill also proposed to cut the dividend rate paid to large banks to 1.5 percent of the current 6 percent level -- something that Chairman Yellen has expressed concern about. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a position on that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So the Senate bill that has been forward by Senator McConnell and Senator Boxer and a couple of others is a piece of legislation that is still under review here by the White House. \xc2\xa0There are a couple of things I can tell you about it, though. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is that, as you know, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve considered other funding bills, the pay-fors have often been a sticking point between Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0So the administration is taking a close look at the proposed pay-fors that are included in this package. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of this that continues to be under review.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that we have reviewed and have some concerns about are some of the provisions related to safety. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Secretary of Transportation on a number of occasions indicate that the top priority of the Department of Transportation is the safety of the American traveling public. \xc2\xa0So we do have concerns about some of the safety provisions that are included in the bill. \xc2\xa0And then, as Darlene mentioned, that as this legislation gets put together, we certainly would like to see and would insist upon the inclusion of the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo all that is to say we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to review the bill. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage in conversations, principally with Democrats on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0And I know that there are a number of Democrats on the Hill who are conducting their own review of the legislation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s where things stand now. \xc2\xa0The thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you of is that as a general matter this administration has been a strong advocate, in fact, we have urged Congress to make the kind of long-term commitment to investments in infrastructure that we believe are clearly in the best interest of the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make that case. \xc2\xa0And even when we indicated our support for the five-month extension that was passed by the House, we did so with the understanding that there was bipartisan agreement that that five-month window would be used to negotiate and agree to a long-term investment in infrastructure. \xc2\xa0So that continues to be our top priority even as we evaluate some of the proposals that have been floated on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us a position on that pay-for or the SPR pay-for, or the other things that are in the bill now?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct. \xc2\xa0Those pay-fors, though, are things that are receiving the close scrutiny of our budget experts here at the White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just going back on the highway bill. \xc2\xa0You did say you would insist on the Ex-Im Bank being a part of that. \xc2\xa0Is that to be interpreted as a veto threat if it\xe2\x80\x99s not included, that you would strike down that bill?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\'m not intending to issue any veto threats today. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how the rest of the briefing goes. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But in this case, what I\'m indicating is that this is a priority -- that the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s and a priority of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s, and it is our view that it should be included in whatever transportation legislation is passed by Congress because it is -- Congress is operating against an end-of-the-month deadline when it comes to transportation. \xc2\xa0We know that there is bipartisan agreement that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that that funding not lapse. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass in advance of July 31st. \xc2\xa0And since we know that to be true, or we know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a high likelihood that that will be true, we believe that reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank should be included in what many in Congress consider to be a piece of must-pass legislation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it merits mentioning that there is strong bipartisan support for the Ex-Im Bank, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if this would be the inclusion of a controversial proposal. \xc2\xa0No doubt there are some members of Congress who oppose it, but there are clear majorities in both Houses of Congress that support the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. \xc2\xa0And we believe it should be included in whatever transportation bill Congress acts on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0There was a poll that came out yesterday by Pew that indicated that among the Americans that have heard about the deal, there\xe2\x80\x99s actually more disapproval than there is approval. \xc2\xa0And the poll was conducted at the same time that you all were sort of doing your lobbying push -- many interviews and multiple statements, the President doing that long press conference. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering what your reaction is to that and what your plan is to shift that public opinion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not particularly concerned about it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s one data point and it is a data point in a poll that did not spend a lot of time talking to the American people about the facts before soliciting their opinion. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s only a data point that we consider with the other data points that had been presented. \xc2\xa0And there is some polling data that does indicate greater openness to the agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the skepticism that many Americans have about this agreement, regardless of which poll you consult, is their concern about trusting Iran. \xc2\xa0And I will tell you that that is a concern that is shared by the President of the United States, which is why the President insisted that whatever agreement was reached include the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0That effectively shuts down every pathway that Iran has to a nuclear weapon including the covert path. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s -- so as the public evaluates this agreement, that\xe2\x80\x99s an important factor for them to consider, which is to remember what the President said about this, which is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust Iran either, and that this agreement is not rooted in mutual trust. \xc2\xa0This is an agreement that rooted in the ability of the international community and international experts to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn fact, that is why the United States and our negotiating partners insisted that Iran take the most critical steps to limit their nuclear program, including reducing their uranium stockpile, removing 13,000 centrifuges, rending harmless their heavy-water reactor at Arak before any sanctions relief was offered. \xc2\xa0And that I think in some ways best illustrates the approach of the administration to this deal, which is that we insisted on Iran taking significant verifiable steps before any sanctions relief was offered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about any of the -- any calls the President may be making or any -- can you sort of describe the lobbying effort that the White House is making? \xc2\xa0We\'re hearing about the opposition lobbying effort from multiple groups, very well-funded, that are going to be going on air with ads against this deal over the next 60 days. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about what the White House will be doing to counter that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We can get you some more details. \xc2\xa0But the White House and the administration are committed to building on the public case that the President initiated in his address to the nation last Tuesday morning in helping the American people understand exactly how this agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and why preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is a critical national security priority -- not just the United States but also our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, and our partners in the Middle East with whom we have important security relations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRebecca.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, congressional Republicans have voted to introduce legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0Senator Paul introduced an amendment to the highway bill today to eliminate all taxpayer funding for it. \xc2\xa0I know you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to issue any veto threats, but would the President veto any legislation with language defunding Planned Parenthood?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously we do not all support a measure like that. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me take a pretty dim view in the past of ideological riders that are unrelated to the baseline bill, and I think, in this case, that rider that seems to be floated by Senator Paul would fall into that category.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President concerned at all about the reports surrounding the video that surfaced last week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I previously indicated, I haven\'t spoken to the President about the actual videos. \xc2\xa0I have read the reports, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he has, too, raising significant concerns about the way in which those videos were selectively edited to distort not just the words of the individual speaking, but also the position of Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0They have made very clear that they subscribe to the highest -- they subscribe and implement the highest ethical standards in carrying out their operations. \xc2\xa0So for questions about that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Planned Parenthood, obviously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on justice reform, how involved is the White House in the justice reform discussions happening within the Senate Judiciary Committee? \xc2\xa0And how confident are you that Chuck Grassley, despite his opposition in the past to reducing mandatory minimums, is making significant progress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there are number of administration conversations that have taken place between members of Congress in both parties and senior administration officials, including officials at the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to tell you about. \xc2\xa0I think the reason that we continue to have those conversations is that we have started to see a new openness from some Republicans to making some common-sense reforms to our criminal justice system that would actually save taxpayers money, but also make our system both more fair and bolster public safety.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraged by what appears to be a genuine bipartisan effort to make progress in this area. \xc2\xa0And we certainly will play an important role in trying to facilitate that agreement. \xc2\xa0And the President would relish the opportunity to sign into a law a piece of legislation that would accomplish those goals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one more. \xc2\xa0Momentum has been building on the Hill to stop federal funding to sanctuary cities. \xc2\xa0Again, would the President veto legislation that aims to punish these cities, counties and jurisdictions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The irony that I have noted in this situation is that many of those pieces of legislation were written and are supported by Republicans who opposed comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0And you heard me say on countless occasions over the fall that blocking comprehensive immigration reform would perpetuate a system that is the closest thing we have to amnesty. It sounds like a lot of Republicans now have taken that view. \xc2\xa0They understand that the situation -- that the system that they chose to perpetuate actually does inhibit our ability to most effectively implement the law in a way that keeps our community safe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the President himself took steps, using his executive authority, to add greater accountability to our broken immigration system, to focus our limited law enforcement resources on those individuals who do pose a threat to public safety. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that the legislation that did pass the Senate with the support of every Democrat and, I believe, a dozen or so Republicans would have included an historic investment in border security. \xc2\xa0It also would have ramped up interior enforcement of immigration laws against dangerous individuals. \xc2\xa0It would have enhanced penalties for repeat immigration violators with sentences of up to 20 years for certain aliens who were convicted of felonies prior to their previous removal or departure. \xc2\xa0It would have increased penalties for passport and immigration document trafficking and fraud. \xc2\xa0And it would have made it easier to remove and deport individuals convicted of gang-related crimes, or who have been repeatedly convicted of drunk-driving violations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese are the kinds of enforcement provisions that were included in the law that Republicans blocked. \xc2\xa0So when they raise concerns about how effectively our immigration system is working to keep the community safe, they have no one to blame but themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But would he specifically veto legislation that withheld federal funding from --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated why we don\xe2\x80\x99t take those legislative proposals particularly seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0On the same issue, Leader Pelosi and Congressman Lofgren said today -- they called for a review of the policies surrounding immigrants who are held by federal prisons that have immigration detainers. \xc2\xa0Is that something that the administration would be open to, reviewing those practices and those communication practices?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Homeland Security for the way that they implement these policies. \xc2\xa0As you know, the President announced some policy changes that would actually focus our law enforcement resources on those individuals who pose a threat to public safety. \xc2\xa0And part of that was done with the goal in mind of more effectively coordinating the efforts of federal law enforcement authorities and local law enforcement authorities. \xc2\xa0So for the kinds of policies that are in place and how those can be shaped to make them more effective, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer to the Department of Homeland Security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, what can you tell us about the timing yesterday on the proclamation on Chattanooga? \xc2\xa0It came out three hours after congressional leaders ordered flags lowered at the Capitol. Was that a factor in your issuing a proclamation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mark, obviously, we make these decisions independent of leaders in Congress. \xc2\xa0But I will note that the proclamation was issued right around the same time that the President was delivering a eulogy for the five servicemembers who were killed in East Tennessee last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say why it was issued five days after the shootings?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a lot of insight to provide to you in terms of that decision-making process, other than to note that it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that was made and announced yesterday. \xc2\xa0And the flag above the building that we\'re standing in right now continues to fly at half-staff in memory of those who were killed in Tennessee last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Then it was planned in advance to be issued yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any more timing details to share with you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just really quick on Iran. \xc2\xa0You\'ve said, others in the administration have said that the hostages who are being held there could not be and were not part of the process of making this nuclear deal. \xc2\xa0But today Iran\xe2\x80\x99s deputy foreign minister, who is also a lead negotiator, said the issue of Americans imprisoned in Iran was negotiated during nuclear talks. \xc2\xa0In fact, the way he put it was that the issue of both Iranian and American nationals imprisoned in both countries was negotiated. \xc2\xa0Your reaction to that statement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I would simply say is the position that we have regularly communicated to all of you is not entirely inconsistent with what he\xe2\x80\x99s just described. \xc2\xa0What we have indicated and Secretary Kerry acknowledged that essentially every time the American and Iranian negotiating teams met that Secretary Kerry raised the need for Iran to release those Americans who are currently being unjustly detained by Iran. \xc2\xa0These are American citizens who should be released and have the opportunity to be reunited with their families. \xc2\xa0The President mentioned each of their cases yesterday, as well. \xc2\xa0What is true, however, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no one on the U.S. side who believed that using these American citizens essentially as a bargaining chip in a nuclear negotiation was going to make it more likely that they would be released.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are a variety of reasons for that. \xc2\xa0I think the best one is that it certainly was not a foregone conclusion that the nuclear agreement would be completed, and that\'s why it seemed rather unwise to pin the stakes -- or pin the hopes of these individuals on a rather uncertain outcome. \xc2\xa0The United States is going to insist upon their release. \xc2\xa0And we do not believe that these American citizens who are being unjustly detained should be used as a bargaining chip. \xc2\xa0And this is a forceful case that Secretary Kerry made by his own account at every meeting that he had with Iranian negotiators.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But did that get a little muddied when you talk about raising the issue in the middle of negotiations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I suppose that you could see it that way -- although I could also imagine you asking me about why Secretary Kerry spent hours with senior Iranian officials but didn\'t even mention the fact that there are three Americans who are being unjustly detained in Iran. \xc2\xa0And so I think it makes sense that in the context of these negotiations, that Secretary Kerry would raise their case, but would do so without allowing the Iranians to use them as bargaining chips.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJames.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s start on Iran, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to Chattanooga, if we could. \xc2\xa0During his appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daily Show,\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama invoked the name of former Vice President Dick Cheney in a way that puzzled some people. \xc2\xa0Why was the President making reference to Dick Cheney yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think he was trying to illustrate that there were some critics of this agreement, the vast majority of them Republicans, who suggest that the President had not sufficiently -- or had somehow not pressed the hardest possible bargain, and there are many Republicans who have indicated that if they were negotiating the agreement that they would have done so more effectively.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact is that under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, we succeeded in uniting the international community to come to the negotiating table to compel Iran to participate in constructive negotiations and convince Iran to take steps to limit their nuclear program, to significantly reduce their uranium stockpile, to remove centrifuges and all the rest. \xc2\xa0And that is a way that we can verify their compliance with the agreement and prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0That was the goal that we set out to achieve, and that was the one that was achieved.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because to some it might seem as though the President, in a number of remarks in recent weeks, has some kind of fixation with Dick Cheney or sees himself as the anti-Dick Cheney. \xc2\xa0Does he see himself as the anti-Dick Cheney?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\'t think that\'s the way he would describe himself.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To Chattanooga. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0A lot of Americans see the President of the United States rushing to make congratulatory phone calls to pro athletes who come out of the closet, to plaintiffs in same-sex marriage litigation who prevail as the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0They see aides here at the White House rushing to swath the executive mansion in rainbow colors only hours after that same-sex ruling from the Supreme Court, but they also see this President of the United States not reaching out to the families, say, of Kathryn Steinle, not reaching out to the families of four personnel who in an apparent homeland terrorist attack were killed at Chattanooga. \xc2\xa0And they might rightly wonder about how the President goes about these kinds of decisions -- which families to call, which individuals to call, when flags get lowered. \xc2\xa0It seems like he might be falling out of touch with the way ordinary Americans view these gestures and his choices in terms of who he bestows them on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, James, I think the President is primarily focused on doing his job. \xc2\xa0And the job of the United States President -- when we see a crime be committed against a military installation inside the United States, the expectation that the average American person has is that the President is going to insist the federal investigators get to the bottom of the crime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s why, hours after this event occurred, the President, who had been traveling on the road, returned quickly to the White House and immediately convened a meeting with his top counterterrorism advisor and with the Director of the FBI. \xc2\xa0He received a detailed briefing from all of them about what was known about the case, and the President spoke to all of you and insisted upon a thorough and prompt investigation. \xc2\xa0That\'s the expectation that I think the average person has for their President, and that\'s exactly what the President fulfilled.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d also note they would expect that the President find an appropriate venue for paying tribute to the service of those Americans. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why, yesterday, the White House announced that the U.S. flag that flies over the White House would be lowered to half-staff. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also why the President gave an extended and moving eulogy, singling out the names and stories of each of the individuals who was lost in that attack in Chattanooga. \xc2\xa0And doing so before the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars is an appropriate way to pay respect and to honor their service to the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that\'s what the American people expect of their President, and I think in this case, the President of the United States delivered.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJerry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to follow up on the negotiations about the Americans held in Iran. \xc2\xa0I know the President spoke passionately about it yesterday, but I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what the next steps are. \xc2\xa0I mean, with the nuclear agreement, for all intents and purposes, done, at least from a high-level, diplomatic negotiation standpoint, are these channels of communication still open? \xc2\xa0Do we expect this now to be the chief topic of discussion whenever Secretary Kerry speaks to his counterpart, or in any future conversations between President Obama and President Rouhani?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that in previous conversations the President has mentioned the priority that the United States of America places on the safe return of those Americans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t, frankly, know when the next conversation will occur either between President Obama and President Rouhani, or even Secretary Kerry or Foreign Minister Zarif, his counterpart. \xc2\xa0But what will continue to be true is that the United States will make their safe return a top priority. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President continue to mention that that\'s the case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat you\xe2\x80\x99ll also hear, though, is that the United States has other significant concerns with Iranian behavior. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue to seek to more effectively counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nefarious activities in the region. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to do that both primarily by seeking to further strengthen our ties with our closest ally in the region, Israel, but also to strengthen our security cooperation with our allies, our partners in the Gulf.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does that mean that the United States sort of relies then on these other -- and I know we don\'t have like diplomatic relations with Iran -- that\'s certainly -- probably presents its own logistical situation. \xc2\xa0But is that -- does the White House see with the nuclear deal done more or less -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word leverage, but at least -- does this issue now become more to the forefront and not so much just another issue that was discussed in the context of the Iran talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d say, Jared, is that this has always been an issue at the forefront for the President and it will continue to be moving forward. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have an update for you on our ongoing efforts to secure their release, other than to assure you that those efforts remain ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMolly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow on a few questions from Susan Rice about Guantanamo quickly.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Obviously, the administration has made clear that they want Guantanamo to be closed. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve made this a priority. \xc2\xa0Members of Congress have asked for a plan to close Guantanamo. \xc2\xa0We know that Lisa Monaco and the Defense Secretary have promised that to Senator McCain. \xc2\xa0Defense Secretary Carter has been speaking about this publicly. \xc2\xa0Why has the White House been reluctant to acknowledge that they\'re working on this plan? \xc2\xa0And why have they cited Congress asking for this plan as a reason to veto the NDAA if, in fact, they want it to be close? \xc2\xa0Also Secretary Carter suggested he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t confident Guantanamo could be closed in this administration. \xc2\xa0What reason do you have to be confident that that goal can be achieved? \xc2\xa0What will you be doing differently to convince members of Congress who perceive perhaps that the White House is putting pressure on the Defense Department to put politics above national security, particularly when we have reporting from The New York Times last night that Susan Rice and other members of the Security Council gave Ash Carter a memo that suggested he had 30 days to make decisions on transfers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot there. \xc2\xa0So let me try to fill you in. \xc2\xa0Well, let me confirm for you that the administration is, in fact, in the final stages of drafting a plan to safely and responsibly close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to present that plan to Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat has been something that our national security officials have been working on for quite some time, primarily because it is a priority of the President. \xc2\xa0He believes it\'s in our clear national security interest for us to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in order to reduce that prison population we need to do a variety of things. \xc2\xa0The first is we need to continue to responsibly transfer to foreign countries those detainees who have been designated for transfer. \xc2\xa0Of course, that does require certification by the Secretary of Defense, that any national security risk associated with that transfer can be sufficiently mitigated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would point out -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering this closely, Molly, so you know that just within the last few weeks there was a transfer of some detainees from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to Oman. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing we need to be able to do is to continue to carry out prosecutions of detainees who can be charged in the military commission system. \xc2\xa0There are a couple of individuals, including one of the masterminds of the 9/11 plot, and one of the individuals who was involved in the planning of the bombing of the USS Cole who are currently going through that military commission process right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also need to provide the remaining detainees that are not designated for transfer with periodic reviews to assess whether their continued detention remains necessary. \xc2\xa0And ultimately, we need to explore individualized disposition options for the remaining detainees.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is complicated work, but we\'ve made a lot of important progress since the President took office. \xc2\xa0And just this year, the detainee population at the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been reduced from 127 to 116. \xc2\xa0The concerns that we continue to have with the NDAA are rooted in the fact that for years now, basically since the President took office, we have seen members of Congress -- and this is true of both Democrats and Republicans -- repeatedly impede the effort to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, despite bipartisan agreement that closing the prison is actually in the national security interest of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact is continuing to operate that prison is not an effective use of taxpayer resources and it certainly is not consistent with our national security interest because we know that some extremist organizations use the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a variety of reasons why this continues to be a priority, and there are a variety of reasons why we expect bipartisan support for our effort to close the prison, and not continued obstruction from Congress. \xc2\xa0That\'s why we\'re continuing to work on a plan that, when it\'s completed, we\'ll be prepared to present and share with Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up with one more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Members of Congress have also suggested that as part of this plan they want to see something to the extent of an overarching U.S. detention policy. \xc2\xa0It\'s been suggested to me that we don\'t currently have a U.S. detention policy, that it\'s ad hoc. \xc2\xa0They want the questions answered of in the future if there is an enemy combatant detained by the United States, how will they be interrogated? \xc2\xa0How will they be held? \xc2\xa0If not Guantanamo Bay, then where and how? \xc2\xa0And we currently have our first Islamic State detainee at the moment and those questions haven\'t been answered either.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Molly, I think that you can actually take a look at the track record that this administration has of taking terrorists off the battlefield. \xc2\xa0In some cases, that means capturing them. \xc2\xa0When they\xe2\x80\x99re captured there is a process, a policy that was created under the President to extract as much intelligence information as possible to advance our national security interests. \xc2\xa0And there has been a discussion in a variety of settings about how the extraction of that intelligence has been useful in carrying out other counterterrorism operations. \xc2\xa0And there are countless examples of those individuals, after being debriefed for intelligence value, then being prosecuted in our criminal justice system here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I don\'t have the list in front of me, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it with me today, but we can provide to you a list of the high-profile, violent criminals, violent terrorists that have been brought to justice in the United States in the context of our criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0We have demonstrated, despite the skepticism of a lot of critics on Capitol Hill, that that is an effective way for us to keep the American people safe. \xc2\xa0It is also an effective way for us to walk the walk when it comes to advocating our basic -- the value that we place on human rights.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is a record and a policy process that the President is proud of. \xc2\xa0Now, obviously there are a range of challenges associated with the prison at Guantanamo Bay and it will require some additional -- the formulation of some additional policy, but that\'s part of the planning process that\'s currently underway with the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Back to the highway bill. \xc2\xa0I know you said that you were continuing to look at the pay-fors, but could the administration support a bill that used the sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a way to pay for highway funding?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Cheryl, I can\'t take a position on that right now. \xc2\xa0It\'s still something that\'s being evaluated by our team.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then I\'ll try another. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, the President called on Republican leaders to start budget negotiations, to lift the sequester. \xc2\xa0Did you get any response from that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of. \xc2\xa0Maybe in some way or another there was a response sent. \xc2\xa0But there has not been the kind of active engagement by Republicans in negotiations with congressional Democrats that we would like to see. \xc2\xa0And there is a tendency in the legislative process to kick things close to the deadline and to allow those cliffhangers to be a process for driving ultimate decisions. \xc2\xa0And that is a process that has not served the country very well -- primarily because there is so much gridlock and dysfunction on Capitol Hill right now that even setting up those deadlines has previously resulted in some significant lapses. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe reauthorization of the Patriot Act is the best example that I can think of in that regard -- that there was a sense by some Republicans in Congress that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really need to engage on these issues with the hope that they could just jam it through right before the deadline. \xc2\xa0But that was a deadline that was missed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is why we urge Republicans in Congress to not play the same game of chicken with the budget of the federal government of the United States and the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0We know that a government shutdown would have a detrimental impact on the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0It did last time, when they played this game, and it would this time if they choose to play the game again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we believe that these negotiations should start right away. \xc2\xa0We believe that Democrats and Republicans should sit down at the negotiating table, like they did last time, to find some common ground and reach an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our national security and the best interest of our economy. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, that process of trying to negotiate that agreement didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur until after a government shutdown occurred. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that this time we can dispense with the drama of government shutdown, have the negotiations start sooner, and put this to rest by settling on some bipartisan common ground before the deadline approaches.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up, Josh. \xc2\xa0The Federal Aviation Association -- Authority, rather -- issued the President\xe2\x80\x99s very particularly detailed travel itinerary. \xc2\xa0This went to airlines. \xc2\xa0It went to pilots, it went to staff, then travel agents, and then finally to Facebook. \xc2\xa0In light of the age of social media, do you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s even possible now to keep the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule private before he actually travels on some of these trips, these foreign trips, which is so critical to his security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Suzanne, as you know, extensive amounts of information about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule have already been distributed, even to all of you, so there are details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule that are already known. \xc2\xa0But the details of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule that are critical to keeping him safe are details that have not been disclosed publicly at this point. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we do not believe at this point that a scheduling change, or any change to the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary is necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is obviously different than traveling to a place like Iraq or Afghanistan, where the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans are not announced in advance. \xc2\xa0But we obviously have taken some important precautions to keep the President safe while he is traveling in Africa. \xc2\xa0And at this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that those precautions need to be changed, particularly in light of a Facebook posting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChristi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you just go back to the question April asked of Ambassador Rice a little while ago, about the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal connection to this trip to Kenya? \xc2\xa0How did the idea for this trip arise? \xc2\xa0Is this something that the President has been wanting to do for a while? \xc2\xa0And is this in any way a personal pilgrimage for him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe it that way. \xc2\xa0And I think for reasons that the President alluded to in his news conference last week, traveling to Kenya as a private citizen was a very different experience for him than traveling to Kenya as the President of the United States; that the security precautions and logistical challenges of traveling as President will prevent him from visiting the village where his familial ties are the strongest. \xc2\xa0That is something that he was able to do as a private citizen, but he will not be able to do that this time around.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think, based on the way the President wrote about his first trip to Africa in his book, I think you probably could describe that a personal pilgrimage of the President. \xc2\xa0This trip will be materially different. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that the President is not looking forward to it. \xc2\xa0He certainly is, both for personal reasons but also for the important policy reasons that Susan discussed when she was out here. \xc2\xa0But the personal impact of this trip will be much different than the personal impact of the trip the President took -- or the trips that the President has taken as a private citizen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up on Christi\xe2\x80\x99s question, following up on my question? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You can do one more, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the issue is -- and I heard the President when he said being a private citizen versus being in the bubble as President. \xc2\xa0But aren\xe2\x80\x99t both significant in their own right? \xc2\xa0Each one could stand alone, significantly? \xc2\xa0I mean, he was a private citizen free to roam and do what he wanted to do in his father\xe2\x80\x99s homeland. \xc2\xa0But then, as President, he goes back as President -- the first African American President -- to where his father was born. \xc2\xa0I mean, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that stand alone as well, just as significant as being a private citizen traveling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, the trip will be significant in no small part because it\xe2\x80\x99s the first visit by any sitting U.S. President to Kenya, as Susan mentioned. \xc2\xa0There are important policy priorities that will be discussed. \xc2\xa0Some of them are related to the economy; some of them are related to counterterrorism and security issues. \xc2\xa0These are important priorities, and the President believes that it will be a worthwhile trip because of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the fact that the President is traveling to the country where his father was born is important and makes it different than other important foreign trips that the President has taken. \xc2\xa0That being said, the expectation that all of us have, and I think the expectation that the President has, is that the kind of personal time that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take when he\xe2\x80\x99s there will not be nearly as significant or as impactful as his previous trips.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSteve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Iran. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and the President has made, the case that the President 10 years from now will have a better ability to deal with Iran, that our military will have better targeting, et cetera. \xc2\xa0But isn\xe2\x80\x99t there the potential here for Iran to have much better air defenses 10 years from now? \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the big concerns I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from members of Congress. People like Senator Menendez are very concerned about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s sales of S-300 missiles to Iran, which they suspended for a number of years and now seem to be on track, missiles that can potentially render our conventional air forces that aren\xe2\x80\x99t stealth unable to attack Iran\xe2\x80\x99s targets. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a big concern for a President 10 years from now, that a wealthier Iran will be able to make it much harder to attack their nuclear targets?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Steve, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re asking some detailed questions about some U.S. military capabilities, and I\xe2\x80\x99d urge you to consult with the Department of Defense about them -- some of which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll be willing to discuss and some of which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they won\xe2\x80\x99t be willing to discuss.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will just say a few things about this. \xc2\xa0The first is that there will continue to be in place against Iran significant limitations on the kinds of arms and missile technology that Iran can acquire. \xc2\xa0And, frankly, what the President is concerned about -- and I alluded to this in a previous answer -- is coordinating more closely with international organizations and with countries around the world, including countries in the region, to better enforce the laws that are currently on the books, to do a better job of interdicting the transfer of illicit technology as it relates to arms and missiles to Iran. \xc2\xa0So that is one priority that the President will continue to pursue, even after this agreement is completed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is that there is no denying the significant intelligence value that\xe2\x80\x99s derived from these international inspections. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not an expert in this field, but this is something that our military and intelligence officials have said in public, which is that this knowledge about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program -- locations, capabilities -- will enhance our ability to respond, including militarily, if necessary. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat certainly positions the President of the United States 10 years from now -- I was going to say the next President, but we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an even longer term in the future than that \xc2\xa0-- not just the next President, but the President after that. \xc2\xa0That President, whoever that person is, will be in a much better position to confront Iran and their nuclear ambitions than, for example, this President was in a position to do. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall when this President took office that Iran was on the march toward a nuclear weapon, and the international was fractured. \xc2\xa0Ten years from now -- and when President Obama took office, there was very limited insight into Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0For example, there was an entire nuclear facility that had not yet been discovered. \xc2\xa0That will not be the case for the President 10 years from now. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTen years from now, the President who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in the Oval Office will know detailed information about the scope and capability of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And they will also have the benefit of the unanimity of international opinion about how to limit Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions. \xc2\xa0Iran will have signed the NPT. \xc2\xa0That means that they will have agreed to never pursue a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0There will also be permanent sanctions in place to determine if they cheat on that commitment, and if they do, there will be unanimity of opinion that they need to be held to account.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that the President 10 years from now will have a stronger hand when it comes to the possible use of the military option -- that that President 10 years from now will also have a much stronger hand when it comes to diplomacy and building strong international support for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And that is another important long-term benefit of this agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the NDAA, since you mentioned it in relation to Guantanamo, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of doubt -- there always has been on Capitol Hill -- that this President would actually carry through on his veto threats over the Guantanamo provisions. \xc2\xa0Can you affirmatively say as they\'re negotiating that bill on the Hill that the President -- this will be the year he\xe2\x80\x99ll actually deliver on a veto threat if they continue to put in those restrictions in that bill? \xc2\xa0Because every year he\xe2\x80\x99s threatened to veto it -- sometimes from the podium, sometimes not -- and every year he\xe2\x80\x99s ended up signing that bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Steve, what I would say is that -- the first thing I would do is encourage you to take a look at the statement of administration position that we released when the NDAA was submitted.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It is weaker this year than last year. \xc2\xa0Last year, Jay Carney issued a statement saying the President will veto this bill, and he ended up signing it. \xc2\xa0This year his advisors would recommend a veto, which is a weaker version. \xc2\xa0And it kind of suggests, well, maybe this will be -- it suggests to people on Capitol Hill maybe the President is going to do what he\xe2\x80\x99s done the last number of years and squawk about it, but when it comes down to it, he\xe2\x80\x99ll decide, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to veto this enormous bill full of a lot of stuff that I and the Pentagon want.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the reason I cited the statement of the administration position is to illustrate that there are a long list of concerns that we have with provisions included in that bill. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a long list of reasons to have concerns about the way that that bill is currently drafted.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I don\'t mean to minimize the significant concerns we have about the Guantanamo provisions included in the legislation. I just -- it seems appropriate to acknowledge that there are a number of other concerns, as well. \xc2\xa0And look, the fact is that when it comes to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, there is bipartisan agreement that continuing to operate that prison is not in the best interest of the United States and our national security. \xc2\xa0Even President Bush, the previous President, has expressed that view. \xc2\xa0That should be an indication that there is a lot of bipartisan common ground to be seized here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd unfortunately, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunction has prevented that from occurring. \xc2\xa0And we\'re hopeful that we can try to short-circuit that dysfunction and actually bring Democrats and Republicans together around a noncontroversial idea, which is that there has got to be a better way for us to spend taxpayer dollars than to spend *more than $100 million [about $350 million] a year operating a prison that only has I think now 116 inmates. There also has to be a better way for us to protect our national security interests than to deliver on a silver platter a particularly effective recruiting tool for terrorists, which is to continue the operation of that prison.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a number of reasons why this is a priority. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t know what to say other than to just assure that this is an issue that the President takes very seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\'re not saying from the podium today the President will veto this bill if the Guantanamo provisions are included?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have to say it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s already been written on paper. \xc2\xa0And this is --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- would recommend. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not the President absolutely will -- if you actually said those words, we\xe2\x80\x99d all be writing about it, I would imagine.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You would all be writing what? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you said the President will veto any defense bill -- any bill, period -- if it prevents you from closing Guantanamo.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President I think has made crystal-clear that he strongly opposes the inclusion of provisions that inhibit the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0And because we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that a priority, that\'s why the President and his advisors have concluded that if it\xe2\x80\x99s included in the NDAA that the President will veto it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConnie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) would you recommend to the President that the U.S. defend Israel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has indicated that there is an unshakable bond when it comes to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security. \xc2\xa0And the best example I can provide of this is the creation and construction of the Iron Dome program under the leadership of President Barack Obama. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that on a fairly short time frame last summer, when that Iron Dome system was being used to protect innocent Israeli citizens from rockets being fired by extremists, President Obama went to Congress and succeeded in getting a bipartisan majority to agree to the prompt replenishment of that system to ensure the ongoing safety and security of Israeli citizens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s just one example of how seriously the President takes the U.S. commitment to the security of Israel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would the U.S. send troops into Israel\xe2\x80\x99s defense?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on hypotheticals other than to urge you to take a look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s record, which demonstrates not just as matters of policy, but also as a matter of the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal view that there is an unshakable commitment that this administration and this country has to the safety and security of Israel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m going to go. \xc2\xa0Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:50 P.M.
