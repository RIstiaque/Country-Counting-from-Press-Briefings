Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:52 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We have a full house today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How come?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s always nice to see so many smiling faces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How come it\'s a full house?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I was hoping you were going to tell me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me do a quick announcement before we get to your questions.\xc2\xa0 This is something you\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard a little bit on, but I just wanted to underscore the significance of this announcement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLast November, many of you were there when President Obama stood alongside President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and made a commitment to reduce our country\xe2\x80\x99s carbon emissions to 26 to 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2025.\xc2\xa0 At the same event, China made a substantial commitment to peak and then reduce their carbon pollution, making a huge and unprecedented commitment to clean energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToday, the United States submitted to the United Nations our plan for meeting this goal.\xc2\xa0 It\'s evidence once again how President Obama and the United States is leading the world to confront the challenge of climate change.\xc2\xa0 And in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, we\'re confident that other countries will now step up and follow our lead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe steps that the United States will take to meet our commitments includes the Clean Power Plan, higher efficiency standards on cars and trucks, improved energy-efficiency standards for buildings, broader efforts to reduce HFCs in methane emissions -- these are gases that have a disproportionate impact on climate change.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is that these steps aren\'t just good for the environment, they also are good for our economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe know that investments in clean energy, including clean energy manufacturing and research and development, have tremendous economic potential.\xc2\xa0 But we can also look back over the last few years.\xc2\xa0 Even as the United States has cut our carbon pollution by more than any other country over the last several years, we\'ve also, over a similar time frame, bounced back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and created more than 12 million jobs in just the last five years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is a significant announcement, and I would anticipate that over the course of this year this is an issue that we\'ll have the opportunity to continue to discuss.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, with that windup, Julie, do you want to get us started today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Officials in Switzerland are starting to talk about the idea of extending the talks beyond the midnight deadline if there is enough sign of progress.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder two things -- one, do you see enough signs of progress today to extend beyond midnight?\xc2\xa0 And how flexible is the President willing to be on this deadline? Are we talking about going into another day, another week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, I can tell you that the President has been updated already today on the latest status of the ongoing talks in Switzerland to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 I would not rule out the President possibly being in touch with members of the negotiating team later today. We\'ll do our best to keep you updated on that situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe update that I\'ve received is that our negotiators have determined, over the context of a mostly sleepless night last night and long negotiations over the course of the day in Europe today, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue these conversations tomorrow as long as -- well, if necessary -- and as long the conversations continue to be productive.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the President has been very clear that we\'ve been having these conversations for more than a year now.\xc2\xa0 The international community, standing alongside the United States, is seeking very specific and very serious commitments from the Iranians to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and to agree to intrusive inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been very clear that if, after a year of negotiating, that Iran is not in a position to make those serious commitments that we\'re going to be prepared to consider other alternatives.\xc2\xa0 But if necessary, if the conversations continue to be productive, it\'s possible that talks could continue into tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that decision hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been made yet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right now, it\'s still March 31st.\xc2\xa0 Our negotiators are engaged in serious negotiations that have been going on not just over the course of the last year, which is relevant here, but also over the last day they\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in very serious negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And if it\'s necessary -- and when I say if it\'s necessary I mean if it\'s midnight and a deal has not been reached but the conversations continue to be productive -- then they\xe2\x80\x99d be prepared to continue the talks into tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does that apply to then another day and another day after that?\xc2\xa0 At what point do you reach your limit on even these short extensions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s fair to say that we\'ve reached our limit right now in as far as --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\'t if you\'re willing to extend another day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in as far as the conversations have been going on for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve established this deadline for trying to reach a political agreement whereby we would have a framework that would guide the technical negotiations that would have to continue into June.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, it also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense if we are getting serious engagement from the other side to just abruptly end the talks based on this deadline, because the fact is, if we are making progress toward the finish line, then we should keep going.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut ultimately, this is, like I said, something that we have been talking about for more than a year now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Iran to make the serious commitments that they know the international community is expecting them to make to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to make those serious commitments, then the United States will, alongside the international community, be in a position of having to consider some other alternatives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to move on to the Indiana religious freedom law. Governor Pence said earlier this morning that he wants to amend that legislation to clarify that it does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that that is the right approach, to amend it?\xc2\xa0 Or do you support a full repeal of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately, putting this state law in place will require some decisions that are made by the state legislature of Indiana and then ultimately by the governor of Indiana.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe kind of public outcry that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in response to the signing of the law I think is indicative of how this piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the governor and other Indiana officials in damage-control mode here because this law has provoked an outcry from business leaders across the state of Indiana.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen criticism from even religious groups inside the state of Indiana.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen concerns raised by the Republican mayor of Indianapolis about the impact that this law would have on the economy of the state.\xc2\xa0 And understandably, we see business leaders saying that they are reluctant to do business in a state where their customers or even their employees could be subjected to greater discrimination just because of who they love.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s not fair.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with our values as a country that we hold dear.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what has provoked the strong outcry, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s what has provoked the previously defiant governor to consider a position of changing the law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some legal scholars and supporters of the law that say it\xe2\x80\x99s actually rooted in a 1993 federal law that\xe2\x80\x99s been upheld by the courts.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that there is a need to amend that law?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that Governor Pence has tried to falsely suggest that the law that was signed in Indiana is the same as the law that was passed at the federal level in 1993.\xc2\xa0 That is not true.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that that\xe2\x80\x99s not true is that the 1993 law was an effort to try to protect the religious liberty of religious minorities based on actions that could be taken by the federal government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Indiana law is much broader.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just apply to individuals or religious minorities.\xc2\xa0 It applies to -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting here -- \xe2\x80\x9ca partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint stock company, or an unincorporated association.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So this obviously is a significant expansion of the law in terms of the way that it would apply.\xc2\xa0 It leaves open the question, what sort of religious views a joint stock company may hold, but that may be something for lawyers to ponder.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting that the law in Indiana doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just apply to interactions with the government; it also applies to private transactions, as well, which means that this is a much more open-ended piece of legislation that could reasonably be used to try to justify discriminating against somebody because of who they love.\xc2\xa0 And again, that is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such a bipartisan and even non-political outcry against this law.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that is also what has prompted Indiana officials to reconsider the wisdom of this approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoberta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about the elections in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the election of the new president, President Buhari?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House assessment of what his new leadership will mean for the fight against Boko Haram?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to speculate on the likely outcome of the elections, but we do congratulate the people of Nigeria who exercised their civic duty by going to the polls.\xc2\xa0 We would like to especially commend the patience that voters demonstrated and their commitment to participate in the democratic process.\xc2\xa0 We also have been heartened by the consensus on the part of independent international observers that the elections were largely free, fair, and transparent, with only isolated disruptions due to violence and technical challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe world is obviously paying very close attention to what happens next.\xc2\xa0 And we here in the United States continue to encourage all candidates to abide by the Abuja Accord signed in January and the additional peace pledge signed last week to respect the official results and to encourage their followers to do the same.\xc2\xa0 This is, of course, entirely consistent with the message that the President delivered to the Nigerian people in the Internet video that we released last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what has to happen for the White House to acknowledge the results of the election?\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\'s a dumb question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we would want to see next is an announcement from election officials inside Nigeria about the results before we would weigh in here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, how does the White House view the Arab military force that was announced on the weekend?\xc2\xa0 Is this a good thing for U.S. national security interests?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we saw from these Arab nations that were meeting in Egypt over the weekend was essentially a commitment to put together a coalition of armed forces that essentially they could draw upon to react to security challenges in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of details that were left unstated, or at least unagreed to.\xc2\xa0 And so we would obviously depend a lot on what sort of -- what the command structure looks like, how decisions would be made about deploying the force.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, the United States has strong relationships and in some cases even strong military-to-military relationships with many of the countries that have entered into this broad agreement.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re obviously going to watch closely what additional steps the countries take to put this together.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll watch closely and have conversations about.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that I would point out is that many of these countries are countries that have contributed to the ongoing military effort inside of Yemen that Saudi Arabia initiated in response to security concerns along their border with Yemen.\xc2\xa0 The United States is providing some important intelligence and logistical support to that ongoing military operation.\xc2\xa0 This is indicative of the kind of strong military-to-military relationship that we have with Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to watch the decisions that are being made by the countries that have sort of agreed to this in principle, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to say at this point -- render a specific judgment on it at this point since there are still so many details that have not been locked down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify briefly, when you said conversations -- the conversations -- is the United States government having conversations with the parties about some of those details that you said were left unsaid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out.\xc2\xa0 These are countries that the United States often -- well, I guess I would say it this way.\xc2\xa0 Given all of the events that are taking place in that region of the world, and given the close relationship that we have with so many of the countries that have been involved in those negotiations, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a surprise that there have been U.S. officials, up to and including the President, that have been in touch with them in recent days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Viqueira.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The deadline tonight -- I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, to begin with, an arbitrary deadline?\xc2\xa0 The agreement, the framework expires at the end of June.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re allowing for the fact they could be extended, which I\'m sure means it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be extended at least into tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the de facto deadline two weeks from now when Congress gets back?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it that way.\xc2\xa0 I think I would concede a little bit on the front end that the date is at least a little arbitrary.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that these negotiations have been going on for more than a year and it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate at some point for everybody to say, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re either going to reach an agreement or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to try something else.\xc2\xa0 Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position where we\xe2\x80\x99re just sort of mindlessly talking without actually advancing toward an agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is why it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate in this case to put in what some might observe would be -- could describe as an arbitrary deadline.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious one nonetheless.\xc2\xa0 And based on the fact that we have been in these conversations for more than a year, it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear to the Iranians what sort of commitments the international community is seeking from them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that by the end of March, we should be able to reach at least the broad outlines of a political agreement that would establish a framework for the technical talks that would continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t envision a scenario where negotiators go away for a couple of days and then come back?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- at this point, our negotiators are still having constructive conversations and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached the deadline yet.\xc2\xa0 What my colleagues in Europe have indicated is that if the conversations continue to be productive but yet aren\xe2\x80\x99t finalized by the end of the day today that they would leave open the possibility of continuing those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about events beyond that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I see this as sort of a big-picture question over the\xc2\xa0 talks.\xc2\xa0 There were reports today that an Iranian military aircraft had an encounter with an American helicopter over the Persian Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And this sort of brings up the question.\xc2\xa0 When you look at the tangled alliances that the United States is involved in now in the region -- the U.S. and Iran are fighting against ISIL, and the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are against Iran, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are against Assad, Iran is on Assad side, Saudis fighting the Houthis, the Houthis are against al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, our enemy -- does all this get a little bit confusing to the American public and make any perspective or potential agreement with Iran a tougher sell?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s first fair to point out that the security and political situation in the Middle East has been complicated and even confusing for centuries.\xc2\xa0 And these kinds of shifting alliances that you are observing are not unique to the Middle East and certainly not unprecedented in the Middle East.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach has prioritized is the safety and well-being of the American people, and trying to act both strategically and opportunistically to advance our interests in this very complicated region.\xc2\xa0 And the way that the President has chosen to do this is to build on the kinds of relationships that already exist in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the best evidence I can point to on this is the success that this President had in building a coalition of more 60 nations to confront ISIL, that the United States is one of the few countries in the world that could step up and build a coalition like this.\xc2\xa0 All of the countries who are part of that coalition have an interest in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL; that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the individual interests of all of those countries, but it requires leadership from someone to step up and say this is all in our collective interest, let\xe2\x80\x99s act together to confront it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s the kind of leadership that this President has showed.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen evidence of the success of that approach; that we have seen inside Iraq that up to 25 percent of the ground that had previously been taken over by ISIL is now an area where ISIL can no longer move freely.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s one piece of evidence to indicate that by building a broad international coalition the President can ensure that the interests of the United States and the interests of the other members of our coalition are advanced.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, Saudi Arabia is obviously very much -- suspicious, would be a generous word to describe the talks with Iran -- over the talks with Iran and want you to get tougher with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Does reaching a deal with Iran strengthen Iran economically in whatever ways that will ultimately pose more of a threat to Saudi Arabia?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, to use your word \xe2\x80\x9csuspicious,\xe2\x80\x9d that Saudi Arabia has been suspicious of Iran long before any sort of conversations began between Iran and the broader international community to try to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 So this is, again, not a new phenomenon.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is the United States and our international partners are engaged in this effort because we believe that diplomacy is the best way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 To get them to make specific voluntary commitments that will shut off every path to a nuclear weapon and get them to agree to a set of intrusive inspections that will verify their compliance with the agreement, that\'s in the best interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of our closest ally in the region in Israel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also happen to believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our partners in the region, as well, including Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 The United States, as we\'re doing right now in Yemen, has taken steps to support Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s national security and to advance their interests in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe do that in a way that is consistent with U.S. interests, of course.\xc2\xa0 And we believe this is another way that we can do that.\xc2\xa0 Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is in the best interests of Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 And we say that because a nuclear-armed Iran is only more destabilizing in the region.\xc2\xa0 It only makes more dangerous the kind of support that they could be offering to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 It only makes it easier and more dangerous for Iran to menace those countries that the United States has strong relationships with, including our ally Israel and also potentially Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we believe that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon through diplomacy is the best way and most likely way for us to get a good outcome.\xc2\xa0 And by good outcome, I mean an outcome that is consistent with the national security interests of the United States and consistent with the national security interests of other countries with whom we have a strong relationship in that region of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to follow up, last week, as you know, President Rouhani spoke to Putin and he spoke to Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 And you were just talking about the President might talk to members of the negotiating team.\xc2\xa0 Are there any circumstances under which President Obama would speak directly to President Rouhani or send him a written message?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alexis, I can tell you that the President has not recently had a phone call with President Rouhani.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything else to tell you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s day.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no call like that that\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow up on the religious freedom-Indiana situation.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about the outcry being bipartisan and not even political.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, there are members of Congress who are thinking about running for President, and former leaders -- a former governor, for instance -- who immediately embraced it.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that they were acting in a political way, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what the law\xe2\x80\x99s implications might be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what\xe2\x80\x99s motivating their decision to speak out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you were saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was political, the outcry, you meant the public as opposed to official?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I meant the criticism of the law that had been signed by the governor of Indiana.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so, so far we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that the deadline is firm -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that said this week -- but now the deadline, it might move.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that this has been going on for a year, and by now, everybody should be ready and where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be, but it would be wrong to end it if there\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\xc2\xa0 So I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re left with, sort of, which is it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, since it\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for a year, if Iran is serious and, as you say, the commitments that they need to make are clear, if they are serious, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be there right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to leave you with the impression that just because these negotiations have been going on for a long time and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what sort of commitments we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking from Iran, that these kinds of conversations are easy.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a very complex issue and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an issue that has significant consequences for the world.\xc2\xa0 So I think it makes sense that they are being very serious, and we certainly have been pleased to see that Iran has engaged in these conversations over the course of the last year with a seriousness of purpose.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in recent days, the talks have been productive.\xc2\xa0 And if they continue to be productive, then we would be in a position where, if an agreement has not been reached by the end of the day over in Europe, that those serious conversations could extend into tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are the sticking points the same -- the R&amp;D, the sanctions, what to do about the stockpile?\xc2\xa0 Would you say that there\xe2\x80\x99s been progress made on any of those three areas?\xc2\xa0 Or do they remain sort of the stalemate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s been true over the last year is that we have declined to get into the play-by-play, if you will, of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And principally, that\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been guided by this notion that nothing is agreed to until every element of the agreement has been agreed to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo at this point, I would decline to offer you a detailed assessment about where the sticking points are other than to tell you that some remain.\xc2\xa0 And as long as we are making serious progress toward resolving those sticking points, then it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that those negotiations could continue until tomorrow.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President is very serious about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this over the course of a year, and it is time for Iran to make some serious decisions about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the kinds of commitments that the international community expects them to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any indications that they are not 100 percent serious?\xc2\xa0 Just the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten to this point and there is no agreement at the deadline, would that alone be an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re not 100 percent serious?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the willingness that they have displayed to engage in serious discussions about some very serious issues I think is an indication that they take this seriously.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a long way from actually getting them to make the kinds of commitments that are required to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and that ultimately is what we are most focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, how would you characterize -- I mean, you said the President is very involved, he may even call the negotiators today.\xc2\xa0 Would you say that he\xe2\x80\x99s encouraged by what you call serious progress?\xc2\xa0 Or how is he viewing this today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think today the President is interested in hearing from his team about where things stand in terms of the negotiations and I think I would characterize him as being obviously very interested in these serious talks.\xc2\xa0 He recognizes the stakes here.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Iran to make some serious decisions.\xc2\xa0 And if they are unwilling to make those serious decisions, I have no doubt that the President will be ready to move on to consider other alternatives.\xc2\xa0 But we do continue to believe that the best way for the United States and for the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are so aggressively pursuing this option.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you say, the stakes are so high here and the President has, in fact, set up this deadline, self-imposed deadline today.\xc2\xa0 With all that in mind, how hard would it be for President Obama to actually walk away from the negotiating table tonight or tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly would not be the outcome that he prefers, but what is also true is that no deal is far better than a bad deal.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to be in a position to sign a bad deal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that Iran is going to have to make serious commitments that shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And they will have to commit to cooperating with intrusive inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is simply that we have seen repeated attempts over the years by Iran to try to circumvent international inspections.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this agreement will be contingent upon Iran\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation with probably the most intrusive inspections of a nuclear program that have ever been conducted.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd Iran has earned a reputation as an organization, as a government, that will go to great lengths to try to circumvent these kinds of inspections, which is precisely why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to insist on the most intrusive inspections that have ever been put in place.\xc2\xa0 And if Iran can make those kinds of commitments in the context of this political agreement, then that would be the best way, the best possible way for us to resolve concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program and to verify that they are not acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut if they\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to make those kinds of commitments that give us that assurance -- and by us, I mean not just the United States, I mean the international community -- then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to walk away from the negotiating table and consider what other options may be available to us.\xc2\xa0 And there is certainly the possibility that that could happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the other options available\xe2\x80\x9d to the United States and the other nations.\xc2\xa0 What message has been sent to Iran that -- or told to Iran directly, at least at the negotiating table that either we come to an agreement here or this is going to happen?\xc2\xa0 What is the \xe2\x80\x9cthis\xe2\x80\x9d that we\xe2\x80\x99ve told them that they better sign an agreement or find an agreement, or else this is going to happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear publicly\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of what sort of words were exchanged around the negotiating table, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very public about the fact that every option for dealing with this situation remains on the table and has been on the table for some time now.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not intended as a threat, but it is intended as --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Every option including military?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The military option has been on the table for quite some time and it continues to be on the table today.\xc2\xa0 That said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been very clear that the diplomatic approach would be more effective in resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapon than the military approach; that we know that between setting back their program, extending the breakout time, having clarity into the actual composition of their nuclear program that we can get all of that through negotiations and, frankly, a lot of that goes away if we consider the military option.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat if deploying the military option were the only option, we would have less insight into Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there would be greater incentive inside the country to actually pursue the kind of breakout window that currently exists for them.\xc2\xa0 And we would do much less to setback their program over the longer term than we potentially could through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 And the reason I say that is we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear, based on some of the reports that have leaked, that this agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking is one that\xe2\x80\x99s in excess of a decade and it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely that military action would have a long-term impact like that on their nuclear program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, finally, just to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, while it\xe2\x80\x99s not the preferred option, the President is prepared and has let the Iranians know that he is prepared to walk away from the table over the next two days if there\xe2\x80\x99s not an agreement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President himself say that no deal is better than a bad deal.\xc2\xa0 The United States will not sign on to a bad deal.\xc2\xa0 The only kind of diplomatic agreement, political agreement that we envision is one that definitively shuts down every path to a nuclear weapon that Iran has and imposes and Iran cooperates with a set of extremely intrusive inspections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not a direct answer to that direct question.\xc2\xa0 The direct question was, is the President prepared to end the negotiating process -- not whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll take a bad deal over a good deal.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a separate question entirely. The key question is, if after a day or two there is no resolution, will the negotiations cease?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And, Major, what I was describing to Jim is that -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t weighing the merits of a good deal or a bad deal.\xc2\xa0 What I was suggesting to Jim is that no deal is preferable to a bad deal, meaning the President is prepared to walk away from the negotiating table before he signed a bad agreement.\xc2\xa0 And by bad agreement I mean an agreement that did not definitively shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and did not codify or at least commit -- get a commitment from Iran to cooperate with intrusive inspections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is no deal, does the Joint Plan of Action continue in force?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the Joint Plan of Action is actually in place through June.\xc2\xa0 And that is true regardless of what Mr. Vaqueira described as the arbitrary deadline for the end of this month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but after that, and there is no deal and no process by which to negotiate one, then it all ends, is that correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will this bill be the verification whatever is going on under the Joint Plan of Action disappears at the end of June if there is no deal or process by which to negotiate a replacement for that, correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding about the way that the Joint Plan of Action is structured, is that it was extended through June, and what the United States and the international community said was that knowing that there are technical aspects of this agreement that will take some time to hammer out, that what we should do is that at the midway point of that extension, essentially by the end of March, the international community and Iran should be able to come together around a political agreement that would establish a framework for that more technical agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just cut to the chase along the lines that Mike was trying to -- really the deadline isn\xe2\x80\x99t now; the deadline is June 31st -- June 30th, rather.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In the mind of the United States, and I think this is shared by the international community, and I think even the Iranians would acknowledge that there is some merit to this argument that trying to work out the political framework and all the technical agreements at the same time would be very difficult; that by establishing a framework in the context of a political agreement, which we believe we should do now would then give our experts time to go through and dig through all of the details.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd here is the thing about this:\xc2\xa0 An agreement like this certainly fulfills that old clich\xc3\xa9 about the devil being in the details, and making sure that every technical detail of this agreement is locked down and is carefully reviewed by both sides to make sure that there is no ambiguity about the kinds of commitments that Iran is making.\xc2\xa0 And these are very technical details that require a lot of precision and we want to make sure that we leave ample time for the scientists to work through those details.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to establish a political framework now, here at the end of March, so that the technical negotiators have two or three months to work through the details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of digging into the details, as you well know, in November of 2011, the IAEA put out a report about the military -- possible military applications of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, not just fissile material, but a lot of other triggering mechanisms and technological advances it made in pursuit of what it feared was a nuclear arsenal.\xc2\xa0 To this date Iran has given no explanation to the IAEA about what those things were, why it did them, or even admitted that they existed.\xc2\xa0 Does Iran have to admit those things were, in fact, pursued?\xc2\xa0 And does there need to be a means by which those things -- triggering mechanisms, other technological advances -- have to be eradicated for this deal to be done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to get too far ahead of what is actually being negotiated right now.\xc2\xa0 But let me --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would have to be a priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that at least some of the things that you are describing are the kinds of things that are the subject of ongoing negotiations right now and would be the kinds of things that would be resolved in the context of the ongoing negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat is also true -- and this is the second thing, and this is important for people to understand, too, when it comes to our approach to Iran -- even if we are able to reach what we and the international community would describe as a good agreement -- again, one that shuts down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon, one in which they make specific commitments about complying with international inspections -- we\'re still going to have a long list of concerns about Iran and their behavior.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to leave anybody with the impression that those kinds of concerns are not going to be -- there are a lot of negatives in there -- I don\'t want to leave anybody with the impression that we\'re going to resolve all of those concerns in the context of these talks.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to be able to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of those other worldly concerns -- Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, whatever --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Support for terror, Americans who are unjustly detained, anti-Semitic threats against Israel.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a long list.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But what I asked you about isn\xe2\x80\x99t a part any of those things.\xc2\xa0 It is central to whatever Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions were in pursuit of a nuclear arsenal.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve made no representations to the IAEA that it finds credible about what it was doing, no evidence to suggest what was going on there.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you, does Iran have to come clean on that aspect of its history and then have a way for that technology to be destroyed for this deal to work and to be considered acceptable to this administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, this history that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing is obviously in the mind of our negotiators who are sitting around the table right now and some of the issues that you have raised are some of the issues that are under discussion in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into those details in a lot of detail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe whether or not it is a high priority for this administration in the context of this negotiation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, at some point, if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement, we will be in a position where we can talk about the -- talk to you and the American people and members of Congress and our allies about what sort of commitments Iran made in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And so the concerns like the ones that you are raising is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss at that point if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quick one.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration believe Tikrit has been freed of ISIS or ISIL domination?\xc2\xa0 Or are those reports or suggestions premature?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there have been some conflicting reports on this.\xc2\xa0 What I understand to be accurate is the statement that Prime Minister Abadi apparently posted on his website this morning U.S. time.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of that -- or what that statement indicated is that portions of western and southern Tikrit had been taken by the Iraq security forces under the command of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been able to make that progress because they are backed by coalition airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 These were airstrikes that were launched at the specific request of Prime Minister Abadi, and it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that those airstrikes had the intended effect, which has made the Iraqi security forces more effective on the battlefield.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we continue to see these Iraqi security forces operate under the command of the Iraqi central government, and we continue to see them be organized and carry out their missions in the kind of multi-sectarian fashion that reflects the diversity of the country of Iraq and reflects the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s commitment that this military operation would not be used as cover to exact sectarian revenge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 On a heavily watched Sunday news magazine program, Bashar Assad was interviewed.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you had a chance to look at that transcript, if the President had -- (laughter) -- and if you have any comment on his assessment, A, that he continues to rule with the consent of the governed, number one, and number two, that he\xe2\x80\x99s encouraged by Secretary of State Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s comments about willing to negotiate his future with him directly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, I did not have the opportunity to see that very well-regarded program that you described -- (laughter) -- but I did see some of the news reports about the program.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about how we believe the future of Syria can be resolved, which is that it should be resolved around the negotiating table in which elements of the Assad regime, but not President Assad himself, would participate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason that we do not believe President Assad should participate is that he has lost his legitimacy to lead that country.\xc2\xa0 His willingness to use his nation\xe2\x80\x99s own military to target his citizens is something that the international community cannot abide, and it is why he has lost legitimacy to lead that country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we do believe that the future of Syria should be decided around the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support international and multilateral efforts to create it, but not with him at the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to Iran and sort of try to differentiate between the political and technical.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve always known that today was this date as a sort of interim place to see was there the will that Iran seemed to be making the kind of commitments that could lead to a permanent deal.\xc2\xa0 But are what falls under the political category and the technical category somewhat moveable?\xc2\xa0 For example, whether -- breakout time.\xc2\xa0 Are the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about as being the difficult things, does there need to be something worked out at this point for it to be considered -- for Iran to have the intent to make a serious deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chris, you\'re asking what is an important question and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to talk about while the negotiations are still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 But I can try to describe for you the idea behind the way that these negotiations are structured.\xc2\xa0 And the idea is simply that at a top-line level, political leaders in both countries -- and when I say -- on both sides of the table, I guess I should say, because we\'re talking about political leaders not just from Iran and the United States, but political leaders in France and the U.K. and Germany and Russia and China participating.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, those political leaders want to come to a political agreement about what kind of commitments Iran is willing to make to demonstrate to the international community that they\'re not going to acquire a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in the context of those political agreements, we would then want to have and facilitate detailed technical discussions where you could essentially, in very detailed fashion, demonstrate how Iran will fulfill those broader political commitments.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is the goal of these talks.\xc2\xa0 So essentially, we sort of establish the top lines on the context of this political agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in other words, like the breakout time and how long the agreement would run, those numbers would already be there.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the details that are sort of in the subcategory that would be considered technical?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, that\'s -- again, I don\'t want to get into the details of what they\'re talking about, but generally speaking, we\'re talking about essentially the broader context of an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And then in the context of the technical details, we would essentially give Iran the opportunity to demonstrate, in consultation with our technical experts, exactly how they\'re going to fulfill the political agreements that they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached, if they\'re able to reach them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick things on Yemen.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Human Rights Chief warned that it\xe2\x80\x99s on the brink of collapse.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration agree with that assessment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not the first time that somebody from the U.N. has made that assessment.\xc2\xa0 Yemen is a very tumultuous place, and it has been for a long time.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are concerned about the political situation inside Yemen, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there is a lot of violence in that country -- even more than usual.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is, of course, supportive of the efforts by Saudi Arabia to try to resolve the security situation along their border.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately we believe that the U.N.-led diplomatic process is one that everybody should support.\xc2\xa0 And that is a process that would result in the Houthis and President Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s government sitting at the negotiating table and trying to resolve their differences in that context, rather than on the battlefield.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are reports that there were dozens of innocent civilians who were killed in a camp in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 The details of how that violence occurred are still unknown at this point.\xc2\xa0 But I do think it underscores, Chris, how important it is for the violence to come to an end, and for the diplomatic efforts to commence so that we can try to bring some civility to that situation and try to end the violence that has wrecked that country for so long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the State Department officials I guess acknowledge they received the letters -- a letter from the lawyers for Sharif Mobley who has been held in Yemen since 2010, expressing concern. They have suggested that this administration -- after it suspended its operations at the embassy -- have abandoned this American, and they are asking for some sort of intervention.\xc2\xa0 They are concerned that the bombing by Saudi Arabia could kill him.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of this letter?\xc2\xa0 Is there any action that is planned to be taken as a result of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any actions to announce at this point, but I can get somebody to follow up with you on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of the letter and the concerns that have been expressed by his lawyer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we have received that letter here, but we can check on that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tShannon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the climate plan that you started with.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to make the deadline today.\xc2\xa0 Numerous other countries under the same deadline aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to make it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about major polluters like China, India. What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on moving forward with a plan that some say is so ambitious there\xe2\x80\x99s no way we can actually physically achieve it when these other countries are -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make the deadline, apparently.\xc2\xa0 But bigger concern, long term, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to make these same commitments and sacrifices that we\xe2\x80\x99re committing to.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Shannon, we have seen China make some very serious commitments, which they made in the context of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visit to China just three or four months ago.\xc2\xa0 And this is an agreement that will stretch over 10 years or so, so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say -- or too early to judge about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to live up to their commitments.\xc2\xa0 They certainly demonstrated how that was possible by making the kind of historic and unprecedented investment in clean energy that would succeed in weaning at least some of their power generation off of or at least away from coal-fired plants.\xc2\xa0 That would have an extraordinarily positive impact on efforts to fight climate change because China is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest emitter of carbon pollution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the kind of serious commitment that we saw them make would have a material difference.\xc2\xa0 And I would acknowledge that you\xe2\x80\x99re right, that over time, China will have the opportunity to demonstrate the seriousness of their commitment to this issue.\xc2\xa0 And there are a whole host of reasons for them to be serious about it.\xc2\xa0 One is that they obviously are keenly aware of the impact of our changing climate.\xc2\xa0 There is plenty of evidence to indicate that there is some political activity in China associated with this, that the population has expressed significant concerns about the poor air quality across that country.\xc2\xa0 So there is an interest in China both in making these kinds of commitments, but also in backing them up.\xc2\xa0 And time will tell if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as a follow to that, not surprising, there is pushback from the Hill from a number of leaders there who say this represents yet another agreement that Congress should be involved with.\xc2\xa0 They feel like they should have a voice in any agreement of this nature on the international scale.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are individuals who -- many of whom, at least, deny the fact that climate change even exists.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they would be in the best position to decide whether or not a climate change agreement is one that is worth entering into.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact is, the kind of an agreement that the President succeeded in striking with China and is implementing here in the United States is one that will have a positive impact on carbon pollution, will have a positive impact on trying to make the air safer for Americans here in this country, and will have a positive impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is pursuing this so aggressively.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly would welcome any kind of support that we could get from Congress on that measure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But content aside, is this the kind of agreement that Congress should have an ability to sign off on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take seriously from some members of Congress who deny the fact that climate change exists that they should have some opportunity to render judgment about a climate change agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the administration was saying that March 31st is the deadline that has to mean something, and that decisions only get harder after March 31st.\xc2\xa0 So given that you\xe2\x80\x99re showing a willingness already to extend the deadline, how does that send a message that March 31st has to mean something?\xc2\xa0 And if decisions don\xe2\x80\x99t get easier after today, then how can you expect to accomplish in another day or two what you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to accomplish in more than a year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because this has been a longer process. That is why -- because we have made some progress and we have seen a sustained commitment by the Iranians to engage in serious negotiations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese talks will -- there are only two scenarios under which -- I guess there are two conditions by which these talks would continue tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The first is that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached an agreement today -- and there are still several hours to go before the deadline.\xc2\xa0 The second is that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually making progress toward that goal.\xc2\xa0 And if it means that we need to continue the conversations tomorrow to complete the agreement, I think common sense would dictate that it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pursuing in that way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that it only gets harder tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any easier.\xc2\xa0 And I think what is a part of these kinds of conversations is that as the negotiators are working through the different issues, that the most difficult issues are the ones that are put to the end.\xc2\xa0 And now that we are essentially at the end of the negotiations, the only things that are left on the table are the toughest things to resolve.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so many long negotiations over the last 24 and 36 hours.\xc2\xa0 And as long as those conversations continue to be productive, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You said the toughest things to resolve are the things that are left, but you did say that there has been significant progress.\xc2\xa0 Would you still put the odds at less than 50 percent?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why not just stick to the deadline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that we have described the odds as 50/50 is that we are mindful of the fact that any sort of agreement will have to be signed off on by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is fair to say that those kinds of decisions aren\xe2\x80\x99t made with a lot of transparency.\xc2\xa0 So there is some doubt about, ultimately, the way that this gets resolved and ultimately, whether or not Iran will make the kinds of commitments that are currently being discussed and insisted upon by the international community.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s that measure of doubt that leads us to continue to conclude that there\xe2\x80\x99s a definite possibility that Iran can\xe2\x80\x99t make the kinds of commitments that the international community is insisting upon.\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then the United States and the international community will be forced to consider some alternatives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have mentioned that over the course of the last year there have been these hundreds of briefings with\xc2\xa0 Congress and also our allies and officials in Israel.\xc2\xa0 Are those briefings continuing as we get down to the wire?\xc2\xa0 Or is the U.S. sort of going into this -- into the final stage of this negotiation hoping to iron out a deal?\xc2\xa0 Or is Congress being given a play-by-play on how things are going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to talk about.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the administration takes very seriously the need to keep leaders in Congress carefully apprised of the status of the ongoing negotiations.\xc2\xa0 With Congress not in session, and in some cases, scattered around the globe, it\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy to track them down.\xc2\xa0 But we have provided updates, and we stand ready to provide additional updates if necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With what looks like sort of a sliding deadline, does that impact sort of keeping Congress on board, keeping them at bay as they want to pass legislation?\xc2\xa0 A lot of Democrats have waited and said that they would wait and hold off until this deadline before they moved forward.\xc2\xa0 Now it seems like the deadline is sliding.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to make it more difficult to keep Congress from going ahead and acting on its own?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our case to Congress has been and always will be that Congress should -- will have an opportunity if a deal is reached to evaluate that agreement, and they should do so on the merits, and they should do so with the ultimate goal in mind, which is to verify that Iran is not able to obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require, as I mentioned, Iran making serious commitments to shutting down every pathway to a nuclear weapon, and it will require Iran to indicate a willingness to cooperate with historically intrusive inspections.<br/>\n\tAnd there will be ample opportunity for members of Congress, for our allies, for our partners, and even for the American people to evaluate the wisdom of this deal if a deal is reached.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnita.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House committee that\xe2\x80\x99s looking into the Benghazi attacks has asked that Secretary Clinton appear before them today -- or not today; they asked today.\xc2\xa0 I wonder what your thoughts are.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also calling it -- it sort of sounds like a private -- that they would close the panel or something because they said it would be a transcribed thing.\xc2\xa0 I know she in the past said she would be willing to appear in front of them.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is even necessary?\xc2\xa0 This is about the emails, obviously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this will obviously be a discussion for the leaders of that committee and Secretary Clinton and her team to have.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an opinion on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past that you think that the White House, the administration has done enough.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly have.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately if the committee makes a request and Secretary Clinton, in her capacity as a private citizen, decides that she wants to once again go above and beyond in terms of trying to provide them information and access, then that would be a decision for her to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLuke.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Warner today said that he would sign on to Corker-Menendez congressional review of any possible Iran deal.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s strategy to try and keep Democrats in line as they approach a veto-proof majority on this legislation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our strategy is principally focused on staying in close touch with members of Congress who have an interest in this agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s currently being negotiated.\xc2\xa0 The second is to assure members of Congress, as the President has, and as I have on a number of occasions, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to evaluate the political agreement, if one is reached, and that we certainly would intend to help them understand exactly what Iran is committed to do.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd once they are able to do that, we would encourage them to consider an agreement -- again, if an agreement is reached -- on the merits.\xc2\xa0 And it is the view of the President -- who is obviously leading this strategy -- that diplomacy is, by far, the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And so that\xe2\x80\x99s the context in which we believe that the agreement should be evaluated.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early for anybody to say that they have concerns about it or that it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a bad deal because a deal hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been reached.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say about your negotiating strategy, though, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s own party seems to be checking him here, essentially getting so close to a veto-proof majority that shows a degree of being uncomfortable of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s how they would describe that.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do is to keep an open line of communication with both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate is that over the course of this situation, we have, on occasion, seen Republicans act in a brazenly partisan fashion to try to undermine the deal.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m specifically referring to the letter that was signed by 47 Republican senators to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that an agreement like this would be subject to -- or negotiations like this would be subject to such rank partisanship.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we are hopeful that that kind of partisan fever has subsided at least enough to convince members of Congress to set aside their partisan interest and actually evaluate an agreement, if one is reached, with the country\xe2\x80\x99s best interest in mind.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a temptation by some to play partisan politics, but that, frankly, is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen on the Republican aisle -- on the Republican side of the aisle so far.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re confident if there\xe2\x80\x99s a deal, there\xe2\x80\x99s enough Democratic support at the end of the day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m confident of is that both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress will have an opportunity to evaluate the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that both Democrats and Republicans will set aside their partisan interests and actually evaluate the agreement based solely on the national security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And if they do that, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have substantial support for this agreement.\xc2\xa0 But, again, this all presumes that an agreement is able to be reached, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached one yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIsaac.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the deadline has changed for today, should we expect that June 30th is a firm deadline for the administration, or could we be, on June 30th, sitting here with you saying, well, if things continue to make progress, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have conversations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a difference -- as has been highlighted both between Mr. Viqueira and Mr. Garrett -- a difference in the deadline at the end of March and the difference in the June deadline.\xc2\xa0 Essentially the June deadline is when the Joint Plan of Action agreement would end.\xc2\xa0 Now, as many have pointed out, the Joint Plan of Action is an agreement that has been extended at least twice, as I recall.\xc2\xa0 But again, the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s been extended twice is evidence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been negotiating over this for a long time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on July 1st, is that when the President starts to consider other options and walks from the table?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I actually would say that if we\'re not able to reach a political agreement in the timeline that we\xe2\x80\x99ve described, that we would walk away from the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 If we\'re not able to reach a political agreement then we\'re not going to wait all the way until June 30th to walk away.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, because of the way that these negotiations are structured, we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us -- when I say \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d I mean Iran and the international community -- to reach a topline political framework prior to entering into the more technical negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to leave some time for those technical negotiations to take place.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what we envision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view at this point that the only thing holding up a deal are things related to the nuclear talks and not any of the other issues in the region?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is our view, yes.\xc2\xa0 And to be specific, the P5+1 is united, the United States and our international partners are united in our negotiating position.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s really holding up the talks is the specific commitment from the Iranians that we need to see.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re making progress against, and that is what would lead us to continuing the conversations tomorrow is if we\'re not able to reach an agreement tonight but yet the conversations continue to be productive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAli.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about Iran first.\xc2\xa0 You, just a minute ago to Luke, said that you want Democrats and Republicans to set aside their partisan differences.\xc2\xa0 But there seems to be growing bipartisan opposition to the idea of letting a deal come to fruition without insight from Congress and a vote.\xc2\xa0 So I just wonder if you could clarify what you mean by having Democrats and Republicans set aside bipartisan concerns -- excuse me, partisan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I hear you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying two things.\xc2\xa0 One is that we have seen Republicans play in a pretty brazen fashion partisan politics with this, that we saw Senator Cotton and 46 of his partners in the Republican cloakroom get together and sign a letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran trying to undermine the talks.\xc2\xa0 And that was a brazen partisan effort.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not consistent with the way that the American people I think would expect their elected representatives to evaluate the best interests of the United States of America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt may be, in the minds of some of them, the best way to try to seek a partisan advantage, but what we\'re looking for is an American advantage.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly the way that the President is trying to conduct these negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the second thing I would say is that this has sometimes been -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be polite -- misunderstood by some members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The administration has long envisioned a role for Congress in this agreement, and that is, specifically, part of this agreement will be eventually the removal of the sanctions that Congress put in place against Iran.\xc2\xa0 In order for those sanctions to be removed, Congress will have to take a vote.\xc2\xa0 And what the United States -- or what the Obama administration has said is that the sanctions put in place by Congress should remain in place for some time until we can see that Iran has agreed to live up to the commitments that they make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what Congress wrote into that sanctions legislation was the ability of the President of the United States to waive some elements of those sanctions, essentially, understanding that that\'s how an agreement would work, that essentially we would see over time the phased reduction in sanctions after Iran over a period of time demonstrates sustained commitment to the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that is the way that we believe the agreement should be structured.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s some difference of agreement about this in Iran.\xc2\xa0 Iran would like to see those sanctions removed right away because they\'re having a debilitating impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 But the United States -- again, given Iran\xe2\x80\x99s past history and their questionable compliance with previous international agreements, we\'re going to make sure that Iran demonstrates sustained compliance to the agreement before we even contemplate removing the kinds of congressional sanctions that have been so effective in compelling Iran to the negotiating table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one more question on Syria?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your announcement today about the $508 million in humanitarian aid, that comes as the international Donors Conference has announced a total of $4 billion, which is still just about half of what the U.N. says it needs to do what it needs to do to shore up the humanitarian situation there.\xc2\xa0 So given that, should the United States be doing more?\xc2\xa0 Should other members of the international community be giving even more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the United States continues to be the largest contributor on a bilateral basis of assistance to this humanitarian disaster.\xc2\xa0 And there are millions of people in Syria and across the region who have been displaced by the violence there.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s tragic.\xc2\xa0 And some of the reporting that I have seen from the region puts a real human face on something that we discuss in somewhat academic terms here.\xc2\xa0 But there has been a real human cost to this political instability and this violence, and it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the United States is demonstrating that we\'re going to continue to lead not just based on our economic and political influence, but by our moral influence; that we as a country understand that people are suffering and that we have an opportunity to try to alleviate that suffering.\xc2\xa0 But that need is significant.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to work with the international community to mobilize the necessary resources to try to meet these needs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, meanwhile, though, the UAE, Saudi Arabia donating on the lower end of the totals that are coming from these countries -- Saudi Arabia only donated $60 million, compared to Norway reportedly donating $93 million.\xc2\xa0 So should those nations that are in the neighborhood be stepping up more and providing more, especially with a country like the Saudis who can probably afford to give a little more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, based on the substantial commitment you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the United States, I think you can interpret that this is something that we feel strongly about.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to continue to encourage countries all over the world to consider what they can do to try to meet this humanitarian disaster for very moral reasons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRichard, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Josh.\xc2\xa0 First, about the 60 nation coalition.\xc2\xa0 Last night, the Canadian parliament voted in favor of extending the Canadian involvement by one year, and from Iraq to Syria.\xc2\xa0 First, any reaction by the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we appreciate the substantial contribution that Canada has made to this international alliance; that Canada is regularly among the more reliable partners that the United States has in a variety of ways, particularly when it comes to military action.\xc2\xa0 And so we are very pleased to see that Canada has prepared to extend their commitment in pursuit of our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a tough debate in parliament in part because of the legal basis to attack ISIL within Syria without the call for help from the Syrian government, and also the length of the mission.\xc2\xa0 First, where are we in the fight within Syria?\xc2\xa0 We talk about some success around Tikrit in Iraq, but in Syria we never hear about any success.\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the mission going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of things that I can update you on.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the effort to train members of the moderate Syrian opposition to enhance their capacity to operate on the battlefield against ISIL is something that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And this is obviously an effort that\xe2\x80\x99s being supported by Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very appreciative of that effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that -- I know that in the past, Canadian military officials have had a role in some of these training efforts.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99re involved in this specific thing, and we can check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 But obviously that is a key component of our strategy.\xc2\xa0 What we need is we need a force on the ground in Syria that can take the fight on the ground in Syria to ISIL.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is one area of the country where we have had a force like that.\xc2\xa0 There are Kurds who have been operating on the ground first in Kobani and then in the areas around Kobani, where they have had success in pushing back ISIL fighters.\xc2\xa0 They have done so with the backing of coalition military airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is some evidence -- and important evidence -- that the strategy that we have laid out can succeed; that by building up the capacity of local fighters, by training them and equipping them, and providing them with military air support, that we can actually turn the tide on the battlefield, and that these forces that have been fighting ISIL for some time without, frankly, a lot to show for it; that they can be much more effective on the battlefield under this scenario with the additional training, with the additional equipment, and with the backing of military air support.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pursue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I would -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re identifying is that the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in Iraq is more substantial than the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is we do have a substantial fighting force on the ground in Iraq that is taking the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have that corresponding ground force in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re working, even as we speak, to train and equip that force so that they can take the fight on the ground to ISIL fighters in their own country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Soon?\xc2\xa0 This year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for an update on that timing, I would turn you over to the Department of Defense, who may be able to give you an update on that ongoing effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:00 P.M.
