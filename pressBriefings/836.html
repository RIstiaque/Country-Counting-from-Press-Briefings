Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:42 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say I see some faces who were with us on our long trip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good to be back.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t do that all -- do this all that frequently these days because we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling so much.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re all happy to be here for the daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple of topics, please.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction is to the teacher strike in Chicago, assuming he\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to follow that story, and whether he has any reaction to both the strike and how his former Chief of Staff is handling it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it -- I know he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with him about it, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for his reaction.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that as a -- more broadly, that our principal concern is for the students, and his principal concern is for the students and families who are affected by the situation.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that both sides are able to come together to settle this quickly and in the best interest of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s students.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a specific reaction from the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney weighed in on it and said that the President has chosen a fight -- chosen a side of the fight, that being the unions and the teachers.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as I think you just heard from me, has not expressed any opinion or made any assessment about this particular incident.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that this President has pursued an education policy that has been a notable success, and a notable bipartisan success, under the President\xe2\x80\x99s and Secretary Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that because he believes, as he says frequently, that investing in education now pays enormous economic dividends later.\xc2\xa0 It is integral to our economic future, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s made it such an important part of his domestic policy agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with regard to teachers in particular, you know that he has on the table, and has had on the table since a year ago virtually today, a comprehensive proposal called the American Jobs Act which includes within it a section that would, if implemented by Congress, if Republicans would stop blocking it, put 100,000 teachers on the job and into our classrooms helping educate our children.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused very much on this issue.\xc2\xa0 He certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with those who think that adding more teachers is not or should not be a priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the President, of course, plans to mark the somber anniversary of 9/11 at the White House, at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether he gave any consideration to having a joint event with Governor Romney the way that he did with Senator McCain when they were both running for the presidency four years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard that discussed.\xc2\xa0 I know he looks forward tomorrow to the moment of silence here at the White House, and then visiting the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly hopes and knows that Americans across the country will take a moment to reflect upon the events of September 11th, 2001, and all that our country has been through together since then.\xc2\xa0 And especially, I think, take that moment to remember the victims and their families from that terrible event.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a TV interview today that Israel and the United States are discussing the U.S. setting red lines for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 What, if any, red lines is the President willing to accept in this case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we have extensive and ongoing conversations and contact with our close ally, Israel, on this issue as well as a wide variety of other security-related issues.\xc2\xa0 We have the most comprehensive security and intelligence relationship with Israel in history, as attested to by not just leaders from this administration but from the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s position, unequivocally, is that he is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and we share that view with Israel and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in a way that has been made clear again and again.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has pursued the policy that he has that has put, together with our international partners, unrelenting pressure on Iran to abide by its international obligations and to forsake its nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe that there remains time and space for that effort to bear frui, an effort that is focused on punitive sanctions to isolate and pressure Iran, and on diplomacy to bring about a change in behavior from Iran.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear that the window of opportunity for reaching a solution by that means will not remain open indefinitely, and that the President retains all options on the table in the pursuit of his commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu when the Prime Minister is at the U.N. General Assembly towards the end of September?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have scheduling updates this far in advance for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other subject.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury has said it will sell $18 million of shares from AIG, the bailed-out insurer, and that that will lower the government\xe2\x80\x99s stake to around 20 percent from a current 53 percent.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the implications of this sale in the view of the administration?\xc2\xa0 And is there any desire to show that the administration is getting out of the bailout business in an election, as we move to the home stretch of the election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the announcements you referred to are part of Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing efforts to exit its investment in AIG, to recover taxpayer dollars, and to wind down the TARP program.\xc2\xa0 That has been an effort in progress now for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And the principles behind exiting investments like the ones in AIG or in General Motors have been that we have been committed to exiting those investments as quickly as practicable, but always with a mind to taxpayer interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think Treasury has the specifics, but what it does demonstrate is an ongoing commitment to recover taxpayer money and to -- I mean, if you look at the history here and the fact that, as you noted, this will bring down the government investment significantly, I think it demonstrates, again, as with the decision to save the automobile industry -- decisions that were made that were politically fraught, but that were viewed by this President as absolutely necessary to ensure that our economy reversed the cataclysmic slide that it was in when he took office, and that steps be taken that prevented an utter collapse of our global financial system that would have led to even more hardship and suffering by the American people here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the specifics on this program and the way it\xe2\x80\x99s worked out, this is all done over at Treasury.\xc2\xa0 But I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that the President is pleased with the progress being made as we wind down these investments and recover taxpayer money.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on the subject of Prime Minister Netanyahu, there were reports from an attendee of a meeting between the U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu about a very heated meeting, and the Prime Minister expressing serious concerns about the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s or President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s failure to draw -- to specify the red lines beyond which Iran cannot cross, and with suggestions that nobody in the Israeli or Iranian government believes that President Obama would act -- that there is no actual threat, because no one believes the U.S. would do anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, can you confirm, or what can you tell us about the meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Ambassador Benjamin [sic]?\xc2\xa0 And, second of all, what do you make of skepticism that the U.S. would act if Iran crossed a line because nobody knows what the line is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The line is the President is committed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and he will use every tool in the arsenal of American power to achieve that goal.\xc2\xa0 And he is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning of the construction of a weapon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, it is not fruitful, as part of this process, to engage in that kind of specificity.\xc2\xa0 What we know, and I have said and many others have said, is that we have eyes into the program, we are aware of developments, and we would know if there were a so-called breakout move by Iran toward the building of a nuclear weapon -- and that has not happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere remains time, based on the information that we have and we and the Israelis share back and forth, to continue to pursue the two-pronged effort here -- a diplomatic push paired with this intense pressure through punitive sanctions and other means that have isolated and pressured the regime in Tehran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause ultimately, the best way to ensure that Iran has given up its nuclear weapons ambitions is through a process by which the diplomatic effort works and a decision is made in Tehran to give up those ambitions and to abide by in a verifiable way its United Nations obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has always made clear -- and I would dispute the characterization that people doubt his will -- the President has always made clear that he retains all options, and that he will use and have available to him all the tools of American power as necessary to deal with this very serious issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my characterization.\xc2\xa0 It is reportedly Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s characterization.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on the meeting itself and reports about the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports about it.\xc2\xa0 I believe Ambassador Shapiro has discussed it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I have no other information to provide to it -- about it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what I think you already know and I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated, and that is that this relationship has never been stronger.\xc2\xa0 There has never been the level of cooperation and integration between American and Israeli military and intelligence agencies.\xc2\xa0 The level of support provided by this administration to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security needs has never been greater, and that will continue.\xc2\xa0 And that has been attested to by Israel\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, not just by those of us over here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our commitment is clear.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s resolve is absolute.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly the case that we need to continue to pursue the policy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in place because there remains time and space to do that, and because ultimately, if pressure on Iran, sanctions on Iran, diplomatic isolation on Iran produces a change in Iranian behavior, that is the best way to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I misstated the Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s name.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s fine.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t -- you do or do not concede that Prime Minister Netanyahu wishes the U.S. would be more public about the red line?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to characterize Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s position on this or other issues.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we have regular consultations with the Israeli leadership, including the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, other leaders, on this issue, as well as many others involving Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0 There is no daylight between the United States and Israel when it comes to what we perceive to be happening in Iran with regards to its program or when it comes to the commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been bad of late of not mixing it up a little bit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- at the beginning of the briefing, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying it always just happens to be after you\'re halfway through.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know the last few briefings I think I did the entire two rows 15 minutes into the briefing before I went to the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am all for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck Todd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying you always want to mix it up after you start it the exact same way for the first three questions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just an observation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anybody else have a -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to know if you -- see if you had any reaction at all to the latest poll numbers showing that the President got a little bit of a bounce coming out of the Democratic National Convention?\xc2\xa0 And also, a reaction to the Romney campaign calling this bounce a \xe2\x80\x9csugar high\xe2\x80\x9d that will dissipate as voters go to the polls on Election Day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First, those are the kinds of questions that are better answered by the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But I can say, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say it as well as others around him, that we have always believed that this will be a very close race, and that continues to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief as well as the belief of those around him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if that helps, in terms of our assessment of things, that\xe2\x80\x99s how we view it.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that stated by not just the President, but members of his team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the Romney campaign calls it a \xe2\x80\x9csugar high\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just know what we believe, which is that this is going to be a close race.\xc2\xa0 It has been and will be.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is very focused on traveling around the country, coming out of the convention in Charlotte, and traveling around the country as he did these last several days, explaining to the American people what his vision is -- what we need to do to continue moving forward to build the economy, to help it create jobs, to create greater security for the middle class -- and why, in this choice between his vision and his proposals and his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s, he believes his are the right ones and his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s are not.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not just, as he says, a theoretical or hypothetical conversation or comparison, because we know from recent, direct experience as a country what the results of policies like those promoted by his opponent would be -- because we\xe2\x80\x99d know what they were.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they took a situation in 2001, where we had the largest surpluses -- we had large surpluses and surpluses projected to last into the future.\xc2\xa0 We had a situation where eight years later, President Obama was handed a greater than $1 trillion deficit, the largest in history, an economic collapse the likes of which this country hadn\xe2\x80\x99t experienced since the Great Depression, and a situation where jobs were being lost at a rate of 750,000 per month.\xc2\xa0 More than 4 million jobs had been lost in the six months before he took office, another 4 plus-million would be lost in the few months after he was sworn into office.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe policies being promoted by the other side are the policies that were in place leading up to the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we need to continue along with the kinds of policies that invest in education, invest in clean energy, invest in research and development, and deal with our fiscal challenges in a balanced way -- protect and build the middle class of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing him talk about all around the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President blame Republicans for the unemployment rate still above 8 percent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about blaming.\xc2\xa0 We know that the country was in economic free fall when he took office, that we were shedding jobs at an alarming rate -- 700, 750, 800,000 jobs per month.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And that continued -- because the recession was in full bloom when he took office -- and it continued into 2009.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOnce the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies -- having been enacted by Congress, acted on by the President -- began to take effect, that free fall was halted.\xc2\xa0 And we have been gradually pulling ourselves out of the hole created by the recession.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have been creating private-sector jobs for 30 straight months, 4.6 million private-sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 We have been seeing a situation where an industry that is iconic to the American people and to the notion of America around the globe -- the American automobile industry, which was on the verge of liquidation, potentially -- was saved, restructured, and is now leading the world again.\xc2\xa0 And, by outside estimates, a million jobs were saved because of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a situation where manufacturing in this country, which had been in decline since the mid-1990s, has experienced a revival and more than half a million jobs have been created in manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 You have a direction.\xc2\xa0 When the President came into office, things were cascading downward at an alarming rate.\xc2\xa0 And we have had a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making steady progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President says every time he talks about this, however, is that we are not where we need to be.\xc2\xa0 We need to continue moving forward.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0 We need to implement policies that help the economy grow, that protect the middle class, that don\xe2\x80\x99t ask seniors to shoulder the burden of the need to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 This is what this debate is all about.\xc2\xa0 This is what this election is all about.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President could not be more passionate about the choice that the American people have to make come November.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a case that the U.S. government recommending immunity to the former President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, last Friday, against a criminal case with regard to a massacre that occurred in Mexico a decade ago.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this will be a bad precedent for the U.S., giving immunity to people who probably are in charge of government, but there are a lot of massacres and human rights abuses?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid demonstrating the risk of venturing beyond the front two rows, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked a question to which I do not have an answer.\xc2\xa0 And I will have to take it or refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, could you take the question, please?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about the new Woodward book coming out.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been some excerpts out.\xc2\xa0 And I think one reported by ABC News said that Woodward said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgaps\xe2\x80\x9d in leadership contributed to the failure of the grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to get the White House feeling on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the report that you mention in particular.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the assessments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can tell you a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 We, here on this side of it, who experienced and lived through the debt ceiling negotiations, those of you who covered it I think understand this well.\xc2\xa0 The President had a number of priorities.\xc2\xa0 First, he was absolutely committed as Commander-in-Chief to preventing a default by the United States, for the first time in its history, on its obligations -- a default which would have led to serious economic consequences both in this country and around the world; a default which, sadly, some elements in Congress, Republicans in particular -- I mean, all Republicans, notably in the House of Representatives -- seems to relish the prospect of coming about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is no question that the President during those negotiations had to be the responsible party and ensure that however they ended, they prevented default.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, he pursued a grand bargain with Speaker Boehner, because he believed it was in the best interest of the United States, best interest of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he demonstrated again and again through that process that he was willing to compromise to make really tough choices and decisions, to ask of his party to come with him -- that they come with him and join him in making compromises.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, unfortunately, throughout that process, whenever the possibility of a grand bargain seemed in the offing, a grand bargain that had to be balanced in nature -- because every bipartisan group that looked at this and every reasonable economist who looked at this agreed that a solution had to be balanced in nature.\xc2\xa0 It had to include cuts in domestic spending, it had to include reforms in entitlement programs,\xc2\xa0 and it had to include revenues.\xc2\xa0 Every time that became a possibility, House Republicans walked away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget this is a party where every one of its would-be presidents stood on a stage and said they would not accept a deal, a grand bargain, that included $1 in revenue for millionaires and billionaires -- just $1 for every $10 in cuts, which is a ratio that is preposterous on its face.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President fought hard for a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 In the end, the Speaker of the House, I think -- while the President believes that he also wanted one -- the Speaker looked over his shoulder and found that there was nobody behind him in his caucus willing to make the compromises necessary.\xc2\xa0 And what resulted was the Budget Control Act that did two things: locked in cuts that had already been agreed to, committed Congress to finding another $1.2 trillion, I believe, in reductions, and ensured that we did not have the kind of game of chicken with our debt ceiling that we had engaged in last summer that caused enormous economic damage even though default never came about.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on that was, from my perspective, significant.\xc2\xa0 And his commitment to trying to find a reasonable compromise was both sincere and deliberate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the end, unfortunately, the Republican position was -- as it continues to be -- which is that they would rather see dramatic cuts in national defense, dramatic cuts in research, innovation, education, infrastructure, border security.\xc2\xa0 They would rather see all of that than ask millionaires and billionaires to go back to the marginal income rate that they had under Bill Clinton, when, by the way, the economy created 23 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 It grew at a pace that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen in half a century.\xc2\xa0 The middle class got stronger, and millionaires and billionaires were coined regularly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the choice that we -- I mean, that\'s the conflict that existed last summer, and unfortunately, it continues to be the source of our fundamental disagreement now.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s very much a part of the discussion that we\xe2\x80\x99re having in this election.</p>\n<p>\n\tNancy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, Woodward in his book also talks about how he believes the President lacked the \xe2\x80\x9cstamina\xe2\x80\x9d in turning personal relationships with congressional leaders into action, and says he talked to a lot of congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle who felt that the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done the work socially to develop relationships either through events here at the White House or outside of the White House, and so he didn\'t have those relationships to draw upon when this went downhill.</p>\n<p>\n\tDoes the President regret that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spent more time socially with leaders of Congress to develop those relationships?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a funny conclusion to reach given how many hours the President spent with the leaders of Congress of both parties in these negotiations, including sitting on his patio, including playing golf, including at the residence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s only played golf once with --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The issue here isn\xe2\x80\x99t did John Boehner and President -- did Speaker Boehner and President Obama get along, because they did, and they do.\xc2\xa0 And it is a fallacy -- and I look at some of the faces here I know who have been covering this for a while -- to suggest that it was the personal chemistry between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich that allowed for the balanced budgets to be created in the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t forget, Speaker Gingrich presided over a House of Representatives that impeached the former President.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what is required here is a willingness to accept the simple proposition that in our system of government, and in a specific condition when we have the Republicans in control -- largely in control in Congress, and definitely in control in the House of Representatives, and the Democrats here at the White House and in the Senate, that not everybody is going to -- you can\'t get everything you want.\xc2\xa0 You cannot stand on your maximalist position and just hold your breath.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we experienced and what we continue to experience is the adamant refusal of Republicans, led by House Republicans, to accept that millionaires and billionaires ought to be part of the deal; that in order to protect the middle class from having their taxes going up, to protect seniors from having to live in a world where Medicare comes in a voucher and their costs skyrocket, millionaires and billionaires need to pay a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 Oil and gas companies need to give up their subsidies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s just a fundamental difference in view that until Republicans in the House, in particular, but also in the Senate, accept the wisdom of the vast majority of the American people, of the bipartisan commissions that have looked at this, there\'s going to be a conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have the same view of this good relationship.\xc2\xa0 He said before, it seems like we\'re on different planets.\xc2\xa0 He said, we\'re not particularly close; we go a while without speaking.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve gone to play golf once.\xc2\xa0 Do you think more could have been done to nurture that relationship --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to the answer I just gave you, which is that it is simply -- again, I\'m not sure what magical past people are invoking where they imagine that in any recent time, serious accomplishments were achieved in policy matters at a dinner in Georgetown.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 And what has to happen is that leaders have to be willing on behalf of all of the American people to compromise and take risk, and not to worry about whether they\'re going to get a challenge from the tea party in their next congressional primary, but worry about whether or not they\'re going to do the right thing by the American people and the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on jobs, the President said in his convention speech, and I think you said it today, that if Congress would pass his jobs plan that you could create another million jobs.\xc2\xa0 But that jobs plan is paid for by raising taxes on wealthy Americans, something that was always going to be a non-starter with Republicans --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You just stated the problem, that on every issue that could be resolved here, the adamant refusal of Republicans to accept the simple proposition that millionaires and billionaires ought to be able to pay a little bit more, that we can go back to the tax rates that were in place when this country had an exceptionally strong economy and millionaires and billionaires did very well indeed -- as long as that remains the red line for the Republicans we have a conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But you introduced it a year ago; it\'s gone nowhere; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Why not go back to the bargaining table and try to figure out another way to pay for it that you could get some traction on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\'s the thing.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated again and again his willingness to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 There are a trillion dollars in cuts in law now that represent cuts in programs that in many cases Democrats would not like to see cut.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, it is simply a fact that because of the fiscal situation we\'re in it was necessary to make those cuts.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been, was, and continues to be willing to do more in terms of spending reductions, but there has to be a concurrent willingness on the Republican side to make some compromises, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, we can relive last summer today, this afternoon if you want.\xc2\xa0 But that was and continues to be the fundamental obstacle to putting in place a plan that would cut our deficits by $4 trillion and make huge progress towards getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, if the entire universe of people who look at this is made up of a vast majority who see it as necessary to approach it in a balanced way, so that middle-class Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t get left holding the bag, so that seniors don\xe2\x80\x99t get left holding the bag, all because one segment of the leadership or of the Republican Party in Congress insists that millionaires and billionaires should remain unharmed, that\xe2\x80\x99s simply -- just because you hold your breath doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you should get your way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that if it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that the President is going to mention it in his convention speech --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 So the idea is it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that he should say, you know what, because Republicans refuse to do the right thing, guess what, middle-class America, you pay the bill.\xc2\xa0 Your taxes are going to go up so that a millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\xc2\xa0 Or if you\xe2\x80\x99re a senior you should pay more directly out of pocket for your Medicare because there\xe2\x80\x99s a faction in Congress that simply will not ask Warren Buffett to pay a little more in taxes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is not going to accept that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s just not.</p>\n<p>\n\tChuck, and then sorry, then I owe you, Wendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One -- considering Arne Duncan, Secretary of Education, his history with Chicago -- obviously the President is from there -- should we expect them to have sort of some public -- to weigh in publicly on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that the sides in this dispute in Chicago can and should work it out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a point where you might step in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on that.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with either Secretary Duncan or the President.\xc2\xa0 I think that we believe that both sides ought to -- and we hope they do -- resolve this in a way that recognizes that it is the interest of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s children that must be preeminent as they work it out.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any predictions for where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to go.\xc2\xa0 We just simply hope that it gets resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to characterize the White House as sort of neutral in this dispute?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t expressed an opinion on how it should be resolved.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re urging the sides to resolve it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This has been -- there are some reports that there were some Chicagoans that have brought this to the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention, this coming showdown before.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not with him every moment of the day, but I -- not in my presence, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know the President keeps saying $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 Does he still have a $4 trillion plan?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or does that already count as -- is there $4 trillion in new deficit reduction that he\xe2\x80\x99s calling for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not okay for Republicans to say, well, thanks for the million out of the four, we\xe2\x80\x99ll pocket it and let\xe2\x80\x99s start again so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you count what\xe2\x80\x99s already been agreed upon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The trillion dollars --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That plan he\xe2\x80\x99s got is an additional $2 trillion?\xc2\xa0 Is that the better way to characterize it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s $3 trillion.\xc2\xa0 The total is $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 So the trillion dollars that have already been signed into law -- the Budget Control Act includes, as part of the super committee and sequester, another $1.2 trillion.\xc2\xa0 Then there\xe2\x80\x99s revenue, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s savings on interest and other things that bring it to $4 trillion-plus.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 It was reflected again in the budget that we put forward earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 And that -- again, within the context of the big plans that have been presented, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Ryan budget or Simpson-Bowles or Rivlin-Domenici, the $4 trillion figure has been sort of a magic number.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve already used -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- but you\xe2\x80\x99re counting a trillion already?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because they were cuts that were negotiated --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this is a $3 trillion -- how would you -- if we were doing math --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The plan was a $4 trillion plan, of which $1 trillion in cuts, just cuts has been enacted.\xc2\xa0 And again, that $4 trillion figure reflects in rough figures what Simpson-Bowles was looking at, and Rivlin-Domenici and others, as what was necessary to begin to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President had a plan that reflected that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd remember, it was built on the principles of his fiscal commission, the principles that some folks celebrate without knowing what they\'re talking about, because Simpson-Bowles not just -- not only did Simpson-Bowles include revenue, it includes substantially more revenue the President has asked for and put in his plan.\xc2\xa0 Not only did it include defense cuts, it included significantly deeper defense cuts than the President believes are prudent and wise and therefore his proposals have less reduction in defense spending.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when you hear Republicans try to get through a discussion in a roundtable or something and cite the merits of Simpson-Bowles, and then you ask them, well, do you actually support eliminating carried interest?\xc2\xa0 Do you support revenues the size that Simpson-Bowles put on the table?\xc2\xa0 Do you support not just all of the provisions, but maybe any of the provisions in Simpson-Bowles?\xc2\xa0 It turns out the answer is no -- which is why, by the way, the leading House Republican on Simpson-Bowles voted no -- Paul Ryan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When are we expecting the sequester recommendations?\xc2\xa0 I know that the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 End of the week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 End of the week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By the end of the week is what I think I said on Friday or Saturday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, who does get the presidential daily briefing if he\xe2\x80\x99s not there?\xc2\xa0 I saw this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw that report.\xc2\xa0 It is hilarious to me --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he\'s not there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He gets it every day, okay?\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States gets the presidential daily briefing every day. There is a document that he reads every day when he is not -- well, he always reads it every day because he\xe2\x80\x99s a voracious consumer of all of his briefing materials.\xc2\xa0 And when he is physically here, most days he has a meeting in his office, the Oval one -- (laughter) -- with participants in -- his national security team, including obviously Tom Donilon and others.\xc2\xa0 He also has regular meetings with --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is about the physical briefing from whoever is giving it versus the written briefing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This was a case of -- I don\'t know how far I want to go here, but I believe if you compare our foreign policy record with the one that preceded this one, we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with that comparison.\xc2\xa0 And this President is very much steeped in the details of national security issues and the information that as President he received --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe this report was misleading --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the article written about it was amusing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You owe me a couple.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I owe you a couple or a coffee?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A coffee, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we chase this new book by Mr. Woodward --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think you have to chase it.\xc2\xa0 You can probably buy it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I am sure he wants you to buy it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He asserts that the idea for a sequestration came out of the White House, if not from the President himself.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I love this, too.\xc2\xa0 The President pushed as hard as he could for a grand bargain to be balanced to include revenues, and then for a sequester to include revenues.\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\'t it include revenues?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think it doesn\'t include revenues?\xc2\xa0 Because John Boehner, Eric Cantor, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan adamantly refuse to ask oil and gas companies, billionaires, millionaires to contribute a dime to the cause of getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the sequester, as it exists, reflects not the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles, but the insistence by Republicans that no revenue be included in it -- which again, goes back to the fundamental conflict that they would rather have deep cuts in the military budget, they would rather have deep cuts in education, in border patrol, in innovation, in infrastructure, and we know in Medicare, than accept the idea that everyone ought to do their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure none of us could ever -- that the Budget Control Act was not just passed with majorities of both parties in both houses; it was celebrated as a victory by Republicans, including House Republicans -- including notable House Republicans -- at the time.\xc2\xa0 There seems a bit of revisionism because of the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s being presented now as a political argument -- there seems to be a bit of revisionism in it, and it has produced what I saw yesterday watching or hearing about the Sunday shows, a bit of conflict at the top over exactly what was right and what was wrong when Republicans overwhelmingly supported the Budget Control Act back last summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the idea of the sequester may have come out of the White House, but the nature of the sequester you say goes to Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where the idea came out of.\xc2\xa0 There have been sequesters.\xc2\xa0 I think in Gramm-Rudman there was a sequester.\xc2\xa0 The idea of a forcing mechanism -- I think everybody in the process, when there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a grand bargain to be achieved because of the Republicans refusal to accept balance, the idea of a forcing mechanism was agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 And then it was a question of what would be contained within that forcing mechanism.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President pushed very hard, in the name of common sense and fairness, for balance, just as he had when he was trying to negotiate a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 Republicans, in the name of ideology, insisted on a lack of balance, and what we have is a sequester -- which, by the way, nobody wants to see become law because it was designed specifically to be so onerous that Congress would actually do something, choosing compromise and hard decision-making over the onerous cuts contained within the sequester -- we have a situation where the sequester includes only cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In part, because of the apparent inability to get past that, the World Economic Forum is now ranking the U.S. 7th in global competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 We\'re down from 5th I think it was, and that\'s down from 4th.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going in the wrong direction.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of it, but I think there is a simple solution and it\'s called compromise, and it\'s called a willingness to accept that we have to have a balanced approach to our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a proposition that I think is broadly accepted beyond the ideological partisan realms inhabited largely on Capitol Hill by members of the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause what we saw -- remember -- I\'ll take you back 13, 14 months ago -- is that even then, during when this debate was happening, there were polls showing that a majority of Republicans supported balance -- a majority of Republicans and huge majorities of independents and Democrats supported the idea that a grand bargain, that a plan to get our fiscal house in order should include the three legs on the stool -- of the stool -- spending cuts, entitlement reforms that strengthen the programs, and revenues.</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess some folks on the Hill like their stools with only two legs.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t stand too well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On 9/11, I wanted to run by you an idea I heard about in some American strategies about 9/11.\xc2\xa0 The idea was that without the Northern Distribution Network for Afghanistan, the strike on Osama bin Laden may not have happened because of the obvious implications for Pakistani relations.\xc2\xa0 So I guess my question for you is, to the best of your knowledge, was NDN as important as all that in the equation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really -- I couldn\'t say.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t be able to make that assessment.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t looked at it.\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to the Pentagon and elsewhere for that assessment.\xc2\xa0 I think if you\'re getting at the value of being able to provide material and equipment to our troops in Afghanistan from the north, it\'s very important -- there\'s no question it is.\xc2\xa0 And the assistance we\'ve received in achieving that has been very important, as we\'ve noted repeatedly, as part of the U.S.-Russian relationship.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of that, I\'m not sure that I\'m the right person to ask that kind of technical question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m in this briefing, so I\'m asking you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as others have discovered, sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you ever heard the President describe, like in a personal way, his memories about 9/11 --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- where he was, what it meant for him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\'s spoken about this a number of times.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is he was in a building in Chicago that was evacuated and he was driving -- he\'s written about this and discussed it -- but he was in Chicago, and I\'ve heard him talk about leaving the building and getting in his car.\xc2\xa0 But my memories of his accounts are probably not entirely reliable, so I would point you to what he\'s said on the record about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want the memories of that day to live on, or basically for the people to get back to normal, sort of?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s -- I think it\'s important to remember.\xc2\xa0 I think most people probably can\'t forget.\xc2\xa0 Ann and I remember where we were.\xc2\xa0 We were on Air Force One on 9/11 as reporters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the nature of, I think, this country and our people is that we remember the tragedy, we remember those we lost, we keep in our hearts their families, but we rebuild and we move forward. As the President said in his speech last week, a new tower is rising over the skyline in Manhattan.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s testament to the kind of people that we have here.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget either.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJulianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Clinton Global Initiative announced today that in addition to President Obama, that Governor Romney would be addressing its meeting at the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that undercuts any of the arguments that President Clinton was making against Governor Romney last week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no idea what any of the other participants are going to say at that forum, but I would simply point you to the speech that President Clinton gave, which I think tells you all you need to know about his views of the President\'s agenda and his vision for moving forward, versus his opponent\'s.\xc2\xa0 So the answer I think is categorically no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, it\'s a little hard to get the bank shot that\xe2\x80\x99s being played here when Republicans embrace President Clinton and say he gave a great speech but don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to actually know what was in it because what was in it was as clear and comprehensive an assessment of the various proposals as you could ask for.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was one that reflected well on the idea that we ought to go back to the policies that we had that led to the recession, that produced the biggest deficits in history, that created a situation where the middle class -- which was already under stress -- suffered mightily, and then take those policies, double down and ask seniors to accept a voucher instead of Medicare.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear any endorsements on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, the end of this week marks the four-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be doing anything to mark that date?\xc2\xa0 And also, does he think now, four years later, that Wall Street has learned its lesson?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware and don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\'ll be doing anything to mark that date in particular.\xc2\xa0 I think that using an adage applied in a different circumstance, the President believes that -- well, I won\'t use the adage, but I think that our financial sector is incredibly important to our economy.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it was essential to the cause of getting the collapse under control and reversing it that we take the steps as a country that we did to stabilize the situation in our financial sector.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was absolutely just as important to push through Wall Street reform to ensure that the kinds of things that led to the great recession, that led to the near collapse of our financial markets, could not happen again, and that taxpayers would not be on the hook when institutions failed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he fought so hard to pass Wall Street reform, and why he is fighting so hard to keep it, against an all-out assault by those who believe that it\'s the right policy to undo Wall Street reform, let Wall Street write its own rules again, and hope that it turns out different.\xc2\xa0 He certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks all.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
