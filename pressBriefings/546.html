Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">1:10 P.M. EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I hope you had a relaxing holiday weekend.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I just wanted to note that the \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper\xe2\x80\x9d event, which was postponed last week due to weather, has been rescheduled for Thursday, February 27th.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Julie.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Geneva talks between the Syrian government and the opposition seem to have officially broken down over the weekend with no plans at this point for them to resume.\xc2\xa0 Does the Geneva process remain the administration\xe2\x80\x99s main focus in terms of a resolution on Syria, or are you looking -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic -- for another process at this point?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the talks are in recess, that\xe2\x80\x99s correct. The international community needs to use this time to determine how to use -- or rather, needs to move forward in determining how to use this time most effectively in order to bring about a political solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So to answer your question, it is still our view, absolutely, that there is not a military solution to this conflict and that a negotiated political settlement is the only path forward for Syria, and the Geneva process is the process by which that is pursuable and achievable at this time.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there has not been a great amount of progress.\xc2\xa0 It is important that the two sides sat down across from each other, but the international community needs to focus on how we can move this process forward.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what do you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cusing this time most effectively?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, to work together to push the process forward, to make the diplomatic channel and the negotiation channel more productive, so that progress can be made towards a solution that allows Syria to move forward, allows for an end to the military violent conflict, so that there\xe2\x80\x99s a transition in Syria away from civil war.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what would be some of the things that the U.S. might look to do in this period in order to try to make those talks more effective?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make in terms of policy steps.\xc2\xa0 We, as a rule, are always looking at all of our options and reviewing old options and new options when it comes to a situation like we find in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It should not be forgotten that the obstacle to progress here has been the regime.\xc2\xa0 The opposition attended the Geneva talks and conducted themselves appropriately.\xc2\xa0 The regime, however, has made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s throwing up obstacles to moving forward and making progress.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you disagree then with U.S. officials who say that the discussion around some of these options has taken on if not increased urgency but there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a renewed focus on looking at options that maybe have been shelved previously?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We got this question last week.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is a standing proposition that the President is always looking for options available to him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing different about that process currently than there was a month ago?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a new review of policy underway, because the assessments of where we are and the options that we have available to us to get where we need to be is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the situation in Syria is horrendous, as the President has said.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to continue to work with our international partners to try to push this process forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We should note that when it comes to the urgent need to allow for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, we have been working with partners on the United Nations Security Council to move forward on a resolution that would advance that cause, and Russia has been a holdout.\xc2\xa0 And it is notable that if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to proclaim your concern about the fate of the Syrian people, one way to act on that concern is to not block progress in the United Nations Security Council on a resolution that would provide humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people who so desperately need it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, on another topic, is there any White House reaction to the U.N. report on crimes against humanity in North Korea?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any at this time.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps State Department does.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait.\xc2\xa0 There is no White House reaction to this report in North Korea? \xc2\xa0This U.N. report about all the atrocities going on?\xc2\xa0 You guys don\xe2\x80\x99t have any statement?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a matter of course, Chuck, we are extremely vocal and critical about the appalling conduct of the North Korean regime.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to this report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can provide one to you, but it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States and this administration is highly critical of the conduct of human rights in North Korea and the persecution of people in North Korea and we highlight our difference with North Korea on a range of issues constantly.</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes, Steve.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Friday night, the President said that there\xe2\x80\x99s some short-term steps to take and some intermediate steps to take on Syria.\xc2\xa0 What was he talking about?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we are looking at the situation in Syria, understanding that the only resolution to this conflict is through negotiation.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely recognize that the situation on the ground is terrible and that the Syrian people are still under constant assault from the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We provide significant assistance to the opposition, including to the military -- military opposition.\xc2\xa0 We provide far and away the most significant amount of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian civilian population.\xc2\xa0 And we are at the forefront of the process that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to produce a negotiated political settlement in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing over the last several days and the President was referencing is that we are constantly looking at options available to make more progress on the humanitarian front and make more progress on the effort to push forward on the Geneva process, the negotiated-settlement process because, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way out of this for the Syrian people and for the future of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that we are all pained by what we see in Syria and enormously frustrated by the obstructionism that the Syrian regime participates in, the unhelpful approach that Russia has taken on the Security Council when it comes to the resolution regarding humanitarian aid access.\xc2\xa0 What remains the case is that we are looking for ways to advance a policy that is in the national interest -- national security interest of the United States and that helps Syria progress towards a negotiated political settlement.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Short of military action, what can be done to pressure Assad to make concessions?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are providing, as I said, assistance to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of partners in that effort.\xc2\xa0 We are also working with our international partners on pressing the Assad regime to engage constructively in a negotiated political settlement, and that includes our partners on the Security Council and our partners elsewhere.</p>\n<p class="p2">The most important part of your question, I think, Steve, is the \xe2\x80\x9cshort of military engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d and I think that while everyone is enormously concerned about and frustrated by the situation in Syria, it should be on everyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind that when we look at the situation we\xe2\x80\x99re in, we have to examine what the alternatives some might be proposing are and whether they\'re in our national security interests, and whether a desire to do something about it could lead us, the United States, to take action that can produce the kind of unintended consequences we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Sorry to belabor it -- Vice President Biden sounded very pessimistic on fast track, according to participants at the Democratic caucus.\xc2\xa0 Is there a recognition here now that this is not going to move forward in any significant way for some time?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I think we talked about this a fair amount last week.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there are differing views in both parties on trade matters has been the case as long as you and I have been covering this in Washington and it\xe2\x80\x99s the case today.\xc2\xa0 The value in the kinds of trade agreements that, for example, we are trying to negotiate with the Pacific region is I think pretty self-evident when you look at the economic growth that that region represents, and the potential for American workers and American businesses through exports to capitalize on that growth through a trade agreement that would protect American workers and protect the environment.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">But we\'re going to continue to press for this authority, as we have in the past, mindful, of course, and recognizing that there are differing views on these issues in both parties, not just the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p class="p2">Move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just follow up on Syria?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you, today, remind us, is the U.S. goal to unseat Assad from control in Syria, or is the goal to end the civil war?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States policy and position is that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future cannot include Bashar al-Assad because the Syrian people have so clearly shown that he cannot be a part of future or transitional government in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a decision that we make here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a decision that the Syrian people have made and have suffered for in the past several years at the hands of Assad and at the hands of his brutal regime.</p>\n<p class="p2">There\xe2\x80\x99s no possibility, in our view -- and this is simply a reflection of the view of the Syrian people and certainly of the opposition -- that a transitional government or governing authority in Syria could include Assad as part of it.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of the talks that have started, albeit without significant progress, is to find a path forward and a transitional governing authority that can be agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 And the only way that can be agreed upon is that it not include Assad, as far as the opposition is concerned, and we certainly support that view.\xc2\xa0 Our goal is an end to the conflict through a negotiated political settlement, and that, again, settlement cannot be possible with Assad remaining in power.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up?\xc2\xa0 If the U.S. is interested in supporting the opposition, is that, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, military intervention?\xc2\xa0 Is that extending the conflict?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do support the opposition, and we have supported the opposition for some time now in a variety of ways. We have made clear our views on different kinds of support and our concern over the course of this conflict when it comes to some provision of weapons that some people have suggested and other countries have proposed or engaged in, that there is a concern about that kind of weaponry falling into the wrong hands in a way that could pose a challenge or a threat to our national security interests or the national security interests of our allies in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that remains the case.</p>\n<p class="p2">Victoria.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you look at Obamacare, including the difficulty with the rollout, and you look at midterms, would you regard it as overall an asset or an albatross for the Democrats?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is this a campaign press conference?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a political question for you.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we have made enormous progress in the enrollment of millions of Americans across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that fact is reflected in the diminished coverage of healthcare.gov and the process involved in getting people enrolled.\xc2\xa0 The problems that we had with the website obviously set back the effort, but the significant improvements we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in enrollments since the website began functioning effectively have been very welcome, obviously, and I think demonstrate that the exchanges work and that the interest among millions of Americans in getting quality, affordable health insurance remains intense.</p>\n<p class="p2">I think that, as a general principle, without gaming out election strategies, it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult case to make, despite the well-documented polling data on Obamacare, for Republicans to say they want to take away the benefits that the Affordable Care Act provides.\xc2\xa0 It is a concrete reality now -- when you have millions of Americans who have quality affordable health insurance, you have millions more who have access to Medicaid in those states that have expanded it that they did not have before, and you have all of us across the country who enjoy other benefits from the Affordable Care Act, including the ability to keep our children on our health plans through the age of 26, including the fact that insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition, they can no longer charge you twice as much as they might charge your twin brother if you had one just because you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman -- these are benefits that the repeal effort would take away.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concrete, they\xe2\x80\x99re real, they have accrued to the American people and to millions of Americans across the country.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think this has gone from an abstract debate to one that involves real people whose lives would be adversely affected by the success of an effort to take away dramatically the benefits that they enjoy.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult argument to make.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that it will be made, maybe not quite in the way that I just made it, but I think everybody who is running on a repeal platform needs to explain why their constituents -- either the ones they currently represent or the ones they want to represent -- should have those benefits taken away so that insurance companies can be put back in charge of their health care.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. position on negotiating with terrorists?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that talks have now been reopened on the release of Bowe Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. position changed?\xc2\xa0 Is it being revised?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have long supported an Afghan-led peace process, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to Sergeant Bergdahl our hearts go out to his family.\xc2\xa0 We have great sympathy for them.\xc2\xa0 Sergeant Bergdahl has been gone for far too long, and we continue to call for his immediate release.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss all the details of our efforts, but there should be no doubt that we work every day, using our military, our intelligence and our diplomatic tools, to see Sergeant Bergdahl returned home safely.</p>\n<p class="p2">We are not -- to go directly to your question -- involved in active negotiations with the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, if negotiations do resume, at some point then we will want to talk with the Taliban about the safe return of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 He has been gone far too long, and we continue to call for and work towards his safe and immediate release.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern about setting a precedent here?\xc2\xa0 Is he a special, unusual case?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, he is a special case in the sense that he has been gone far too long.\xc2\xa0 And we are very concerned about him and our hearts go out to his family and we have great sympathy for them.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been going through quite an ordeal.</p>\n<p class="p2">We have long said that we support an Afghan-led process, reconciliation process with the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 And we are not involved in any negotiations with the Taliban, active negotiations, but if negotiations were to resume, we would certainly want to discuss the fate of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this seen as very time-sensitive?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he should, in our view, be returned as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up on that first.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States open to the idea of a prisoner exchange?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know the story you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, again, we won\xe2\x80\x99t discuss all the details of our efforts.\xc2\xa0 With respect to Guantanamo, the President reiterated, when he signed the fiscal year 2014 Defense Authorization Act, that this administration will not transfer a detainee unless the threat the detainee may pose can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to try to do this generally, a prisoner exchange for a POW held by a terrorist group, would that be the\xc2\xa0 kind of negotiations with terrorists that this administration would not be open to, or would be willing to engage in?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, we have long made clear that we support an Afghan-led process of negotiations and reconciliation with the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 We are not involved in active negotiations with the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 If negotiations were to resume, we would certainly press the case of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, we are actively engaged in an effort to see his return.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t document every effort, but that includes our military, our intelligence and our diplomatic tools.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Syria.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times there is no military solution to the problem in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is there or are there military options for stopping some of the killing that has been done by the Assad regime?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has said that he does not take the use of American military force off the table in Syria or in any of these circumstances.\xc2\xa0 So, in that sense, the military option always remains available and on the table.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear we do not see American boots on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at options, we are very interested in actions that move a process forward towards a conclusion that we think is the only one that can lead to a resolution of the conflict in a way that is best for our U.S. national security interests and the interests of our partners and allies in the region.\xc2\xa0 But we look obviously at all options as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about for the last several days and weeks.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all options, as you said, except for boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify, some have suggested a no-fly zone to ground the helicopters that are dropping the barrel bombs on civilians in Syria, targeted air strikes on those helicopters and on fixed-wing aircraft in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Are either of those military options under renewed consideration?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, a lot of ideas that have been discussed in the past have been put forward of late in the press, and I recognize that.\xc2\xa0 Having said that the President would never take the use of military force off the table, we also firmly believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution to this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And as a general principle, I think that the use of military force in any circumstance like this needs to be engaged in with a very clear-eyed sense of what the consequences of that use of force would be and what the policy objectives would be that are being sought and that can be achieved.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just trying to understand the process here, you said that they\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it in the press.\xc2\xa0 No doubt.\xc2\xa0 But these were clearly options that the President decided not to pursue in that past.\xc2\xa0 Is there any renewed consideration given how bad the situation has gotten on the ground -- \xe2\x80\x9cworst humanitarian crisis in a generation,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of our U.N. Ambassador -- is there any renewed consideration of those military options?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specific options to itemize that I can say are being considered beyond saying that we are always considering all plausible options when it comes to advancing our goals in this terrible conflict.\xc2\xa0 And our goals include the negotiated political resolution of the conflict in a way that allows for transitioning governing authority -- a transitional governing authority that does not include Bashar al-Assad, who has significant Syrian blood on his hands.\xc2\xa0 And that is in keeping with the interests and desires of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given how bad it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten, and given the apocalyptic language coming from some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s own top advisors on this, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be a renewed review?\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President be asking for new options?\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President be saying, come to me, we may have to do a review of this policy, obviously what\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now is not working, the crisis is getting worse -- why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be a new comprehensive review?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re putting words in my mouth that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak.\xc2\xa0 I simply said that the review has been ongoing, that the suggestion that there is some --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said there is not a new review of policy underway.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be a new review of policy?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t do something new that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing all along.\xc2\xa0 We could call it new for the public relations value in it.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is the President has been asking for all of the options available to him constantly in the course of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And so, in the interest of providing factual information, I can tell you that the review of options that is ongoing is not new, but it is broad and it reflects a recognition that the conflict continues to exact a terrible toll on the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 It has significant regional implications and is a challenge to the national security interests of the United States and our partners and allies.\xc2\xa0 And for those reasons, this review is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And the President takes no option off the table, but nor does he rush to or embrace an option that might sound good because of the frustration we all feel over the terrible situation there, without thinking through the implications of the use of that option.</p>\n<p class="p2">Bill.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that the only resolution in Syria is through a negotiation.\xc2\xa0 But how do you pursue negotiation with someone who the Secretary of State says is being put in an advantageous position because of Russian military help and who shows no sign of being willing to negotiate?\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to say, let\xe2\x80\x99s negotiate, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to see how you can get there.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, the fact is that was the case before we actually succeeded in establishing the Geneva process and before the parties actually sat down across from one another. And while we\xe2\x80\x99re not --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- haven\xe2\x80\x99t resolved the problem.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t resolved and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought an end to the conflict immediately.\xc2\xa0 There has not been significant progress from those negotiations, but it is only from those negotiations or negotiations as a general matter that this can be resolved.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a military outcome here that ends the civil war and allows for the Syrian people to open a new chapter in this history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We need to work -- because the work is hard and because it is frustrating doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the right course.\xc2\xa0 And we understand and share the enormous frustration that those who care about the Syrian people and what they\xe2\x80\x99re suffering are experiencing.\xc2\xa0 Our goal is to pursue policies that provide the aid necessary to the Syrian people that push pressure on our partners who have the capacity to either block or allow aid to reach the Syrian people, and to pursue policies that support and provide assistance to the opposition -- the moderate opposition as we continue to press all parties to negotiate an end to this conflict.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That presumes that the war will simply drag on while you continue to pursue these goals, which have so far proved, to put it mildly, elusive.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the question?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would you not want to advance somehow the possibility that you could affect regime change there?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that we should invade or attack?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think obviously questions that reflect the enormous suffering that\'s happening in Syria and the frustration that everyone feels about that are completely understandable.\xc2\xa0 Concrete policy alternatives are even more welcome.\xc2\xa0 And if you have one, let me know.\xc2\xa0 Because I don\'t think that, for example, a U.S. invasion of a country in the region is something that would be in the national security interests of the United States, or would be viewed by the American people or the representatives in Congress as the right policy.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it the President himself who, at that podium, set the red line almost two years ago and said, if they were to use these chemical weapons, it\xe2\x80\x99s a red line, enormous consequences.\xc2\xa0 Where are those consequences?\xc2\xa0 You pushed back for a time because they were -- you said, they were turning over chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 Turns out Assad is not turning over --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, Ed, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating the two things.\xc2\xa0 The red line --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, the red line on the chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 Then you said he was turning them over, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- well, first of all, there is no question that the Assad regime has blown some deadlines on the transport and delivery of its chemical weapons supplies.\xc2\xa0 The regime is still committed to ridding itself of those supplies, and Russia is on the hook for making sure that, as the regime\xe2\x80\x99s significant ally, that those chemical weapons and the supplies are delivered and the regime is fully rid of chemical weapons as part of that agreement.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, the fact is the President said that was a red line.\xc2\xa0 He threatened the use of force in response to that.\xc2\xa0 And because the threat was real, we saw the Assad regime go from refusing to acknowledge it even had chemical weapons stockpiles to acknowledging that it had them and to reaching an agreement that they would give up those weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to -- and the international community is going to hold both Syria and Russia responsible for the fulfillment of that agreement.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would anyone believe you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold them responsible when this has been going on for years?\xc2\xa0 And in answer to Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question when you said \xe2\x80\x9cthe review is ongoing,\xe2\x80\x9d if the review is always ongoing, doesn\'t that suggest that you\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to spin your wheels because you\xe2\x80\x99re just reviewing and reviewing, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not an endpoint to this?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating a bunch of things, Ed. When we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about policy as a general matter -- not just with regards to chemical weapons, but as a general matter in Syria -- we are constantly reviewing options that would allow us to provide more and more effective humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, that would allow us to provide more and more effective support for the opposition, and that would allow us to advance the essential cause of diplomatic negotiations that could lead to a peaceful political settlement to the conflict and a transitional government.\xc2\xa0 And those are the range of options that the President is constantly asking for and evaluating, because we all recognize that progress has not been coming quickly on Syria and we need -- together with our partners -- to press for a solution here on behalf of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick things, one on national security.\xc2\xa0 James Clapper, you probably saw comments he made to the Daily Beast where he -- he at one point said, \xe2\x80\x9cI probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say this, but I will.\xc2\xa0 Had we been transparent about this from the outset, right after 9/11, which is the genesis of the 215 program\xe2\x80\x9d -- he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the metadata -- \xe2\x80\x9cand said both to the American people and to our elected representatives, we need to cover this gap\xe2\x80\x9d -- he said, if we had been more transparent, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had these problems, that Edward Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s leaks wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had as much of an impact on the American people if the intelligence community had been more transparent.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly don\'t think that Director Clapper is saying anything that should come as a surprise.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going all the way back to the event that led to the creation of some of these programs.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said \xe2\x80\x9csince 9/11,\xe2\x80\x9d so he was talking about both administrations I should point out.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in what the President has done in the steps that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, that he absolutely shares the view that we need to enact reforms and take steps that provide more transparency to the American people in a way that gives them more confidence that the intelligence gathering we engage in is done with full oversight and in accordance with the Constitution and the law, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s done solely with the aim of protecting the American people, protecting the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question:\xc2\xa0 On 2014, when you were asked about it before, you obviously said you don\'t want to get too much into politics, but you believe that health care will be an asset for Democrats, for the President in 2014.\xc2\xa0 David Axelrod undoubtedly agrees with you on that part of the story, but in The New York Times today says he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned the Koch brothers are spending $20 million on Senate races.\xc2\xa0 And he said he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned there are some Democratic activists who are too focused right now on 2016, too excited about that, and losing sight of the election ahead of you.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House share a concern that your fellow Democrats are not focused enough on the fact that if the President loses control of the Senate that will be a big problem for him?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, this is not a campaign briefing.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is obviously going to engage and do everything he can to assist Democrats running in 2014, but he is principally focused on an agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to expand opportunity for the American people, strengthen and expand the middle class, reward hard work and responsibility.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you lose control of the Senate, that legislative agenda -- if you put aside politics for a second, if you lose control of the Senate, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be pretty hard to get that agenda through, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he is not going to, and the Democratic Party is not going to lose control of the Senate, in our view.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because of the policies that he and Democrats support that are focused on expanding opportunity, as opposed to repealing benefits; that are focused on providing broad support for the middle class so that it can become more secure going forward; and that more jobs are created, as opposed to support for special interest tax loopholes that benefit the few.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a general principle.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels very strongly that that approach is one that broadly speaking the American people support.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to Venezuela, the government there has thrown out three diplomats -- or is trying to throw out three diplomats from the country.\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. response?\xc2\xa0 Are they going to go ahead and agree to the order?\xc2\xa0 And is there -- in the past there\xe2\x80\x99s been retaliation where the United States has asked -- has ordered Venezuelan diplomats out of the country.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be retaliation?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the Venezuelan government has notified the United States that it has declared three of our consular officials PNG -- persona non grata.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many times that the Venezuelan government tries to distract from its own actions by blaming the U.S. or other members of the international community for events inside Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 And these efforts reflect a lack of seriousness on the part of the Venezuelan government to deal with the grave situation it faces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The allegations against our diplomats by the Venezuelan government are baseless and false.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve long said, Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s political future is for the Venezuelan people to decide.\xc2\xa0 We urge the Venezuelan government to work to address its people\xe2\x80\x99s grievances forthrightly, through real, meaningful dialogue.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. values its strong, historic and cultural ties with the Venezuelan people and remains committed to our relationship with them.</p>\n<p class="p2">I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction to announce or preview.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or anything that says any -- kicking anybody out of the country?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction to that information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything about -- Leopoldo Lopez, who has been the leader of the opposition, turned himself in to Venezuelan authorities.\xc2\xa0 Any U.S. -- any reaction to that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re deeply concerned about the violence in Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 We are alarmed by the Venezuelan government\xe2\x80\x99s use of security forces and armed gangs affiliated with the government to disrupt peaceful protests, which is disproportionate and threatens further escalation of the violence.\xc2\xa0 Venezuelan authorities have arrested and detained scores of anti-government protestors.\xc2\xa0 We call on the government to release them immediately and to provide the political space necessary for meaningful dialogue with the Venezuelan people.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t do this, is there an action you\xe2\x80\x99ll take?\xc2\xa0 Is there --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those responsible for acts of violence must be held to account through impartial investigation and independent judicial processes.\xc2\xa0 I have no other action to preview.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other foreign policy questions.\xc2\xa0 Going back to North Korea, I know that you guys time and again publicly condemned the actions of North Korea as human rights violations. What about with China?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything beyond asking China to do more about North Korea that the U.S. plans to do?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s no minor thing.\xc2\xa0 China has a unique and significant leverage with North Korea, and because of that fact, we engage with the Chinese directly on these matters and encourage the Chinese to --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you guys ever punished China for not doing anything?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that we make clear to the Chinese that we believe very strongly that it is in not just the U.S. interest but in the interests of regional security, including in the interest of China, that North Korea take steps to deescalate some of the provocative behavior that they engage in periodically, and ultimately to get right with the international community, to comply with the series of United Nations Security resolutions that it is in violation of, and we will continue to work with the Chinese and others to help bring that about.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess the point is, is that does China realize that they can do nothing because it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the United States is ever going to react other than a strongly worded statement?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I agree with that assessment and I think that we are working with the Chinese on these issues, as well as our partners in the region, on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Syria, you guys are obviously -- I know that we\xe2\x80\x99re all beating a dead horse maybe on this, but is there a -- obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of urgency.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline that the President is operating on -- that, okay, you know what, he\xe2\x80\x99s not abiding by the chemical weapons, this is still going on, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got three weeks or else -- I mean, is there some sort of timeline he\xe2\x80\x99s operating on here in deciding whether to shift the policy or not?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the way to answer that question, Chuck, is that we are actively engaged in a process of looking at the options available to the President to advance the goals that we believe are necessary, which include making sure that humanitarian assistance is being provided the Syrian people -- we continue to be the lead nation when it comes to providing that assistance -- making sure that our assistance to the moderate opposition is being delivered and our assistance to the moderate armed opposition is being delivered.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work on an international basis to press for the only path forward when it comes to resolving this conflict, which is through the diplomatic channels and negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and on the matter of CW, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we believe the Assad regime as well as the Russians must comply with their obligations to the international community when it comes to ridding the regime of its chemical weapons supplies so that they can be destroyed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if they don\'t, what?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no consequence to something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened to announce today except to say that this is a very serious matter -- as we demonstrated last fall, which lead to this agreement -- and that we and our international partners take it very seriously.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the resumptions of talks over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, does the administration still think there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance of a comprehensive agreement?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our view hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed in that we think that it is absolutely the right thing to do to test whether or not Tehran is serious about resolving this conflict diplomatically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">There is no question that the prospects for success are a matter of serious debate or that -- they\'re far from a sure thing, either way.\xc2\xa0 But because there is at least some prospect that Tehran might be willing to in a verifiable, transparent way convince the international community that it has forsaken pursuit of a nuclear weapon, we ought to do through diplomatic means.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Resolving this issue through the use of military force has to be something that we obviously never take off the table but can\'t be a first option.\xc2\xa0 And because, in the wake of their elections and the enormous pressure that the unprecedented sanctions regime has placed on their economy, the Iranian government was willing to move forward with talks and to reach the interim agreement, the JPOA, and now to engage in the comprehensive settlement discussions is worth exploring.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously mindful of the fact that they may not result in an agreement, but because they present the opportunity, we have to take it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of a sticking point is their recent ballistic missile testing?\xc2\xa0 And how important is that to these talks?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want to be very clear, per the Joint Plan of Action agreed to by Iran, Iran must address the U.N. Security Council resolutions related to its nuclear program before a comprehensive resolution can be reached.\xc2\xa0 In other words, they have to deal with matters related to their ballistic missile program that are included in the United Nations Security Council resolution that is part of explicitly, according to the Joint Plan of Action, the comprehensive resolution negotiation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929, passed in 2010, prohibits Iran from undertaking any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology.\xc2\xa0 So that is explicitly agreed by Iran in the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 And I think that applies -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that that applies to all of the United Nations Security Council resolutions in this area.\xc2\xa0 That is explicitly referenced in the Joint Plan of Action.</p>\n<p class="p2">Scott, then Mara.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thinking back on the Libya intervention for a minute, the President spoke after that and told the American people that the principles he acted on were, by all American interests, imminent humanitarian catastrophe and a military strike with partners.\xc2\xa0 And it was easy for a time in Syria to see that the parallels were not there, but now the Syrian army is moving on the ground, on Aleppo, which looks a lot like Benghazi -- a second city, seat of the rebellion.\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t those same parallels coming into clearer focus for the President?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve left out some of the parallels that continue not to line up with the Libyan example, including the international agreement to take action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had the Arab League.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So this is as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in the past, including, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, the Arab League.\xc2\xa0 So it is our view that there is not a military resolution to this conflict and that we need to continue to press forward with an effort that is aimed at reaching a negotiated settlement between the two parties because that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to ensure that Syria has a fighting chance in the future as opposed to an extended, ongoing conflict.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you try to reengage the Arab League to get their endorsement, which was crucial to the Libyan intervention?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are engaged with all our partners in the region on this very serious issue.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that that\xe2\x80\x99s around a certain prospective action that could be taken, but as a general matter, this is something that we need everyone who is concerned about the fate of the Syrian people and about the instability this conflict causes in the region to be engaged in so that we can help move the process forward.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like without the Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s support, you\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in any sort of -- considering a military option and Russia is not going to give you that.\xc2\xa0 So are you being hung up by the U.N. at this point?\xc2\xa0 Is that what is --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear that we don\xe2\x80\x99t take any option off the table; the President has made that clear.\xc2\xa0 What we are focused on is a path forward that recognizes that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution to this conflict and that the only way forward for the Syrian people is through a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 Now, how we use our leverage and the leverage of others to help push that process forward is very much what we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in now, and the progress has been frustratingly slow, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question about it.\xc2\xa0 But it does not change the essential fact in our view that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military resolution to the conflict.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 When you say that, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no military resolution to this conflict, there was in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t there -- was there a moment in this conflict when there was a military solution to it, and has that moment passed?\xc2\xa0 And if you had acted then, would the situation be different now?\xc2\xa0 In other words, by waiting as long you have to begin to consider these things, obviously the battlefield is a lot more complicated.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think for reasons that you better than most probably here understand there are a host of differences between Libya and Syria, and that play into even hypothetical counterfactuals about what might have been in that conflict.\xc2\xa0 And what has been the case all along is that the President has pursued a policy that he believes puts as a priority United States national security interests and that is supportive of an opposition that wants to rid itself and Syria of a tyrranical regime, and that envisions working with partners in the region to help bring about a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 So engaging in hypotheticals about actions that could have taken by sort of stating all other things being equal when of course they weren\xe2\x80\x99t and aren\xe2\x80\x99t doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really get you very far.</p>\n<p class="p2">Cheryl.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On minimum wage, CBO has been looking at the effects of raising the minimum wage on employment.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to critics who say raising the minimum wage will cost jobs and cut hours?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point them to the ample documentation from respected economists who say the opposite -- that there is not evidence that it has a significant impact on jobs, and that, to the contrary, it\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial to the economy and to efficiency and productivity.\xc2\xa0 And the theory behind the opposition to raising the minimum wage -- that it costs jobs -- if you tease it out all the way, then there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a minimum wage at all.\xc2\xa0 And there are probably fewer than 5 percent of the American people who believe that.\xc2\xa0 That would be let\xe2\x80\x99s just pay people a dollar an hour, and nobody believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do any more than paying them a full-time wage that keeps them below poverty is the right thing to do, which is the situation we have now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So, again, there are far greater economic minds than this one who can attest to the fact that raising the minimum wage, certainly in the way that has been proposed and the President supports, is the right thing to do for the economy and that does not have a significant impact on jobs.</p>\n<p class="p2">Olivier.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, did the White House invite any of the original \xe2\x80\x9cMonuments Men\xe2\x80\x9d to tonight\xe2\x80\x99s screening?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not have a list of participants, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get those to you later in the day.\xc2\xa0 The White House is hosting a screening, as you know, of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Monuments Men\xe2\x80\x9d today, or tonight.\xc2\xa0 The cast and crew have been invited, along with officials from the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Cultural Heritage Center who are our country\xe2\x80\x99s modern-day \xe2\x80\x9cMonuments Men\xe2\x80\x9d and women.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the White House curators, members of the Jewish community and officials from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum will attend.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get you a fuller list.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just -- one more.\xc2\xa0 On Syria, in late January, Director Clapper told Congress that the area is under control by the al Qaeda-linked militants now.\xc2\xa0 It looked like they\xe2\x80\x99re becoming the new FATA, the new lawless Pakistan areas.\xc2\xa0 Did that change the President\xe2\x80\x99s outlook on the usefulness or the desirability of entering the conflict militarily in any capacity?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His testimony?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, that was news to at least me that that\xe2\x80\x99s what was going on there.\xc2\xa0 Did that change -- did finding out that this is becoming a new petri dish for this stuff, did that change the way he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about this?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that among the many concerns that we have about the situation in Syria is the presence of extremists and al Qaeda-linked organizations and individuals.\xc2\xa0 And that is obviously a concern anywhere that it presents itself. And it speaks to sort of both sides of the issue when you talk about actions that you might take.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the issues that has always been discussed was making sure that the provision of assistance gets into the right hands and isn\xe2\x80\x99t passed on to those who have designs on U.S. national security interests or on the interests of our allies.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s always something that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, Director Clapper identified that in that testimony.</p>\n<p class="p2">Mark.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to trade if I can, and also specifically about the North American Summit -- trade is if not at the top of the agenda here, it\xe2\x80\x99s close to it.\xc2\xa0 What is the President going to tell to the other two leaders about the possibility of completing an accord of this Trans-Pacific Partnership that all three countries have been trying real hard to get finished when the leaders of his own party have thrown up roadblocks to it?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a useful exercise when reporting on this discussion and debate to make sure that your readers are aware of the fact that \xe2\x80\x98twas ever thus.\xc2\xa0 And the differing opinions on these matters are not new, and the fact that there are differing opinions within both parties is not new. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- obviously, the President will be speaking to this during his visit, broadly, in terms of what the agenda is and what the discussions will be at the summit.\xc2\xa0 But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that the wheel has been recreated here when we talk about the differing views that people have on matters of trade expansion.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what does he hope to accomplish tomorrow?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information on the visit. And the President himself will obviously be speaking at the summit.\xc2\xa0 But these are obviously two close allies and partners, and he looks very much forward to the discussion and the meetings.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, before you go -- Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The government has moved in to clear out protestors.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here obviously at the podium -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have new info on.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you we are appalled by the violence that was already taking place in downtown Kiev, and reports of armed riot police amassing on the edge of Maidan.</p>\n<p class="p2">We continue to condemn the street violence and excessive use of force by either side.\xc2\xa0 The force will not resolve the crisis. To restore peace and stability we urge President Yanukovych to deescalate immediately the situation and end the confrontation at Maidan.\xc2\xa0 We also urge him to restart a dialogue with opposition leaders today to develop a consensus way forward for Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">Last one.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- says that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with opposition leaders tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t respond, absent my BlackBerry, to breaking news.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p class="p2">Last one.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the Vice President or the President reached out to Mr. Yanukovych in the last few days?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the fairly regular conversations that the Vice President in particular has been having with President Yanukovych and others in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 If we do have an update on that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it to you.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thanks very much, guys.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
