EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I apologize, my email is not working.\xc2\xa0 I would have a readout from the AfPak meeting that the President was in for more than an hour today.\xc2\xa0 I will try to get that as we\'re in flight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlso in that readout is -- the President stopped by a meeting at the White House -- the Pakistani delegation is here for strategic dialogue, including Foreign Minister Qureshi and General Kayani.\xc2\xa0 I will, like I said, endeavor to coax technology into getting me that readout before we get to our destination. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Their meeting was at the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President stopped by for about half an hour. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were there meeting with Gates and Clinton and John Brennan? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the subject of the trip to India come up in his meeting with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m trying to think -- I was in -- not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I was in for about half of the meeting -- the AfPak meeting -- where Pakistan was discussed, but the trip to India -- I do not recall.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his meeting with the Pakistanis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will double-check, but not that I\'m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he met with the Pakistanis did he talk to them about the cross-border raids?\xc2\xa0 Was there a repeat of the earlier apologies from a couple of weeks ago?\xc2\xa0 Was there talk about the Pakistanis --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get the full readout for that.\xc2\xa0 I know that certainly in the AfPak meeting a whole host of issues, including border crossings, was brought up in the Situation Room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some reports that China is considering restricting exports of rare earth.\xc2\xa0 How big of a concern is that for the White House?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President has been briefed on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I asked our NSC guys to give me some guidance on this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports, they\xe2\x80\x99re looking into it but don\'t have anything that they could confirm about those reports at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say hypothetically, how big of a concern this would be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to do that because I\'d rather get a sense of whether the reports are -- whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any validity to -- which they had not been given at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion about the -- I assume there was a discussion during the AfPak meeting on the reconciliation efforts with the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Can you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was, again, not in for that part of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I stepped out about halfway through.\xc2\xa0 So let me get -- my problem is that\'s stuck in my email, but I\'ll get that.\xc2\xa0 I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you address some of the reports that the President has decided, or the White House has decided not to send the President to the Golden Temple because of concerns about him having to wear a headscarf?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We pick sites on foreign trips based on what the President wants to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve not finalized the schedule for Asia, including India, yet.\xc2\xa0 We hope to do that over the course of the next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe send advance people to many places in each country before we make decisions, in consultation with the host country, in this case the Indian government, about where to go. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d love to spend a lot more than the three allotted days that we have in India.\xc2\xa0 This trip will focus our business on Mumbai and -- in the cities of Mumbai and New Delhi.\xc2\xa0 But we pick where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go on trips based on what we hope to accomplish.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you say about the timing of the release of this report on women in the workplace, women in the economy, as the President campaigns for two women senators who -- Senate candidates who are in tight races?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I mean, just over the course of the past several weeks, the President -- the White House hosted an entrepreneurial summit.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke at I guess it was Fortune Magazine, an event on women in business.\xc2\xa0 So, look, this has been a continuing focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the underlying -- obviously our underlying work on and interest in strengthening the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the timing isn\xe2\x80\x99t political.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that obviously is on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind and I\'m sure is on the minds of people of the states that are represented by women in the Senate and those that aren\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The polls for Boxer and Murray are tightening.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be a matter of getting out the base?\xc2\xa0 And is that one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s main goals here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this about our trip across the West and also into Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President, as I talked about yesterday, I think will take another opportunity to remind voters of the importance of the election, what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, whether we continue moving forward or whether we go back to the policies that got us into this mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the speech. And, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see good enthusiasm on this trip.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting to a point in the campaign where it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the campaigns that have identified their voters make sure we get them out to -- get them out on Election Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re not altering the message in the speech -- at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what you told us yesterday; I assume that still holds -- does that indicate to us that you think it\xe2\x80\x99s working?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, we think we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- look, I think this is the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made for a while and it\xe2\x80\x99s the case we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, Republicans are the ones that have said they want to go back.\xc2\xa0 They want to start by repealing Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 They want to start by rolling back the protections in the health care reform bill that ensures that people can stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 insurance up to the age of 26, or ensures that if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get kicked off your insurance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the direction that they want to go.\xc2\xa0 And the President has got a different direction and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll lay out on all these stops out West.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President done enough to make the case to voters what Democrats would do if they maintain control of Congress?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he going to have to lay that out beyond just drawing the contrast with Republicans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look -- I mean, look, I think we have, over the course of the past two years, laid out what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- what we\'ve done and what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do in terms of strengthening the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out some very specific ideas on cutting taxes and increasing our investment in infrastructure, to put -- increase construction jobs and put folks back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere are a whole host of things that clearly the President is going to continue to work on and pursue regardless of the outcome of this election.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the backyard event?\xc2\xa0 Who is going to be there, and will there be questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- there will be.\xc2\xa0 Let me get some more details on it.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s the Seattle event, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that up front with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a fundraiser tonight in addition to the rally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe there is a high-dollar event prior to the rally, and I will double-check on the schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President going to be doing in the final weekend before the election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We do not have the schedule set, but I\'m hoping to have that schedule for you sometime on this swing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing on Election Day itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Washington.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His schedule shows him doing some radio interviews on Friday.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us who those outlets -- those stations are?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 I do not have Friday\xe2\x80\x99s schedule yet, so let me check and I\'ll pull that right before I come back. And let me go rescue my email and see if I can get the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the foreclosure crisis, you have people like Harry Reid who he\xe2\x80\x99s going to help on this trip continue to say they want a moratorium.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really heard the President say anything on that about whether he\xe2\x80\x99d be in favor of a moratorium on foreclosures while all this is worked out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said almost every day in the past week where we are on that and what efforts are being done through HUD and FHA; what the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force that\'s compromised of HUD, Treasury, DOJ, and others, our regulatory agencies, which met at HUD today and are looking through the mortgage process, the mortgage servicing process, to ensure that services are following the law.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that for those that aren\xe2\x80\x99t following the law, they should be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 We support what the AGs are doing because there are obviously a lot of applicable foreclosure law is done at a state level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve enumerated our concerns with what would happen with a blanket national moratorium.\xc2\xa0 But I think what\'s important is to underscore that each servicer must take steps necessary to ensure that their process is meeting the law, and if they can\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy those requirements, then pausing to fix their process is what they should be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLet me try to get Friday\xe2\x80\x99s radio stuff.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll double-confirm the fundraising component of tonight, and try to wrest the readout from my email.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question.\xc2\xa0 The Daily Show -- why did he agree to appear on that?\xc2\xa0 And is there any significance to that so close to Election Day?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a program that younger voters and even occasionally older voters, the 39-year-old age group, catch, if they can remember to stay up late.\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to appeal to a younger voter audience that is a big part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s base.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 Let me go find those questions.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be right back. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t* * *<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Give me a little bit on the radio interview, because I want to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s locked in and everything --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on the schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to the radio interview, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- I just want to make sure that the logistics are all locked in before --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a local station or a network, or what is it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a national thing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTonight there is a fundraiser before -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a photo line fundraiser before the rally.\xc2\xa0 No remarks.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s just -- people run through for pictures, and then the rally.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a separate event.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all right there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much is expected to be raised at that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can see if there\xe2\x80\x99s an estimate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a print pooler contingent there, or is it closed press?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a -- yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just a photo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a fundraiser for Kitzhaber?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a Yankees/Rangers score?\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have it up here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was 4 to nothing, Yankees, when I came --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What inning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the 4th.\xc2\xa0 But the Rangers then had a man on second.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s right there.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t get it right there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he watching the game?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is watching the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he have a favorite?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not really pulling for anybody in this one. It\xe2\x80\x99s -- Jim Messina, who\xe2\x80\x99s on board, is a big Yankees fan, and he looks more nervous than normal -- how about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll right, guys. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t5:42 P.M.
