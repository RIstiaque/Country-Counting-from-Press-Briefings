GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Let me button my coat and give you all a quick look at a week ahead.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will participate in a live town hall meeting on jobs hosted by CNBC. \xc2\xa0That is at noon at the Newseum here in Washington. \xc2\xa0Later that day, the President travels to Philadelphia for an event for the DNC and an event for Congressman Sestak.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, President Obama will award Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger of the U.S. Air Force the Medal of Honor. \xc2\xa0Chief Etchberger will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for his heroic actions in combat on March 11, 1968, in the country of Laos.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will hold an event here at the White House on the Patient\xe2\x80\x99s Bill of Rights. \xc2\xa0In the afternoon, the President will travel to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly. \xc2\xa0He will also attend an event for the DSCC and the DCCC\xe2\x80\x99s joint committee that evening.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will address the United Nations in New York City. \xc2\xa0Later, the President and the First Lady will join President Bill Clinton to address the 2010 annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City. \xc2\xa0The President will also hold bilateral meetings with Chinese Premier Wen and Japanese Prime Minister Kan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On Friday, the President will attend meetings as part of the U.N. General Assembly, including attendance at a U.N.-hosted meeting on Sudan to look ahead to the critical 2011 referendum. \xc2\xa0The President will also host a meeting with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in New York. \xc2\xa0The President has invited the leaders of the 10 ASEAN member states, as well as the ASEAN Secretary General, to join him for the second ever U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting. \xc2\xa0In the evening, the President will return to Washington.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We will have more on the President\xe2\x80\x99s bilat schedule a little bit later on for that week at the U.N.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, the President said that Elizabeth Warren will play a pivotal role in helping him determine the best choice for the director of the new consumer protection bureau. \xc2\xa0Does that rule her out as --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think as you have seen from her blog post and from the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, the President offered her the very critical and important job of standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- something that the President fought for, Secretary Geithner fought extremely hard for in the financial reform, and based on an idea conceptualized, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, by Elizabeth Warren.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So she has the critical task of -- because Treasury has under the law the powers to set this up, the President will nominate a director and Elizabeth will be instrumental in helping the President fill that position.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So she is not a candidate for that position?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to help the President find new leadership.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could she be a candidate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Guys, I think her focus right now and I know the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus right now is to get started on the very critical work of standing this up. \xc2\xa0This is unlike -- well, unlike any nominee that the President has made, what he\xe2\x80\x99s nominated her to do was just create it. \xc2\xa0It needs to stand up in its own existence; that is, this bureau will pull together functions from seven different departments and agencies into one to protect the consumers and middle class of this country as the President discussed. \xc2\xa0The power to set that up rests in the law with the Secretary of Treasury and with the Department of Treasury, and that\'s who she\xe2\x80\x99ll report to.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you address the criticism from Republicans and some business groups about circumventing the Senate? \xc2\xa0Was that the --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to understand that in the legislation passed by the Senate, is exactly as I just described it, this is -- she is not the director. \xc2\xa0She is -- she works for the Secretary of Treasury and the President of the United States and has the duty of standing up something to protect consumers that, as we just discussed, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t currently right now exist. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a team of about 30 or 40 people at the Department of Treasury working on this.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tShe will lead those people in setting this up. \xc2\xa0But the law specifically writes into it that the Department of Treasury is to stand this agency up -- again, pulling the strands of seven different departments and agencies into one Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo this is -- she\xe2\x80\x99s not the director. \xc2\xa0As I said earlier, the President will appoint a director. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to go around.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will you commit to making her available to testify on Capitol Hill, which is what some Republicans are --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, and I will certainly check.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, so you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling her out as a candidate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say this. \xc2\xa0She is focused on setting this up. \xc2\xa0I think you heard the President and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard her over the course of the past many years talk about what would the financial crisis have been like if when people went to get a mortgage or when people got a credit card, instead of a 30-page contract that most people -- I guess including myself and many in here -- probably don\xe2\x80\x99t read the whole thing; a credit card that might -- whose interest rate might explode without you knowing; fine print. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a big task and a big job.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When does the President hope to name a director, Robert?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think over the course of the next several months.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Next several months? \xc2\xa0And if she isn\xe2\x80\x99t named as the first director, would she remain a special advisor? \xc2\xa0How long is that job actually going to be --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s an end date for that. \xc2\xa0Obviously the President very much values her advice. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk about the job that she begins today, not when she ends.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, why was she not given the job of director? \xc2\xa0Why go this route as an advisor?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think first and foremost the President wanted somebody like Elizabeth Warren, with her background, with her experience, and most of all with her passion, to get this going on the right road. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stand this up.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Secondly, nominating -- anybody that gets nominated, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take months and months and months before they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to be involved in the standing up of this position. \xc2\xa0And we know from the appointments process that the Republicans in the Senate have virtually ground to a halt; nearly 200 nominations are pending. \xc2\xa0Nobody was going to be confirmed anytime soon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So how do you -- what the President was focused on was how do you get this agency started, how do you get this agency stood up -- and this made perfect sense.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So then you were trying to circumvent that whole process --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, no, no, again --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- that could have been contentious and would have delayed the process, right?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no. \xc2\xa0Dan, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I think this is very -- this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard, but I think it bears explaining. \xc2\xa0There is a -- there will be a director. \xc2\xa0That director will go through and must be approved by the Senate. \xc2\xa0But, again, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you might drive by the Department of Commerce as you come to work today. \xc2\xa0You might drive by the Department of Treasury. \xc2\xa0Those buildings physically exist and their functions exist within those buildings.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of standing up the function of the CFPB. \xc2\xa0The task of setting up and standing up that function rests in the law with the Treasury. \xc2\xa0Elizabeth Warren is an advisor to the Secretary of Treasury to do exactly that. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no circumventing of the law in any way on this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, and just -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a stab again at just her future role. \xc2\xa0By taking on this current role, does that preclude her from putting her name in the pool, as it --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat that the President will nominate a director and Elizabeth will be instrumental in picking who that is.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Chip.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to beat this dead horse many times during this briefing, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. \xc2\xa0But she said she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the job. \xc2\xa0Why would you not rule her out if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the job?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, then let\xe2\x80\x99s put it in her words. \xc2\xa0I mean, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Chip, I think the -- I hate to use the Washington versus America argument, but I will.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0All right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll use it anyway. \xc2\xa0I got to tell you -- and, look, I think this goes for -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll actually -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll make an amendment to my original argument. \xc2\xa0I think there are a lot of people in this town that do care about what the function of this bureau is going to be.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 How are we going to make sure that mortgage contracts are in simple English and are understood? \xc2\xa0How do we enforce the credit card law that the President signed just last year that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for fine print, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for the types of shenanigans that we\xe2\x80\x99re used to and that some of us have probably fallen prey to?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\'s what she\xe2\x80\x99s focused on. \xc2\xa0That\'s what the President wants her to be focused on. \xc2\xa0The President will nominate a director. \xc2\xa0That director will go through -- rightly go through Senate confirmation. \xc2\xa0But right now, her job is to stand up what the President believed was an important priority and did not want to wait, as you heard him say, in standing that agency up.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, let me try the America versus Washington thing. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re asking you a very simple question -- is she on the list of possible nominees -- and you give these long answers without answering the question yes or no. \xc2\xa0I think the average American concludes --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, if she said she\xe2\x80\x99s not interested, then there\xe2\x80\x99s your answer.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re going to take her word for that then, and that\'s the end of the discussion?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It would be awkward to contradict her on the first day.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you are ruling her out then?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0If you want to quote her, I\xe2\x80\x99ll quote her.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told by people in the West Wing that if she were nominated at some point, she would have to cease all activities related to getting this organization up and going. \xc2\xa0Is that correct?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That is -- that is, as I understand it, an agreement that both the parties in the Senate have on nominations. \xc2\xa0So I think that is -- that goes to the argument that I was making to Dan. \xc2\xa0You\'re talking about probably -- I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear and honest, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about probably a 10-month pause on getting something like this set up, right?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I mean it took 10 months -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me use this example before -- it took 10 months for our nominee for -- to run the GSA to get confirmed. \xc2\xa0It just --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it would make it impossible for her to be the nominee here because in her position now, her dual role that she has at Treasury and the White House, she would have to stop that job if she became the nominee. \xc2\xa0She would have to stop setting up the agency.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, she could not be involved in, yes, in the functions of setting a lot of this up. \xc2\xa0But, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand why the President did not think delaying -- through any nomination -- delaying setting this structure up.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, you have several measures in front of Congress right now designed to stimulate small business job growth. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we saw the President out on the campaign trail last night. \xc2\xa0Any regrets about this being proposed during the campaign season when it\xe2\x80\x99s such a political time of year?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the legislation that the Senate finally passed yesterday with the help of a couple of important Republican votes wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I guess if you want to say the silly season is all of every election year. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think that\'s true.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 This has been pending for a long, long time. \xc2\xa0This has been pending for months. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss the importance of small business tax cuts and small business lending on event after event after event. \xc2\xa0This passed the House, it went to the Senate, and it took an inordinately long time to be dealt with.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s understand, Mike, I don\'t -- there is a political calendar that the Constitution and law has set out for a long period of time. \xc2\xa0The economy may or may not -- usually won\xe2\x80\x99t -- bend to a political calendar. \xc2\xa0And if the President sees that there are things that need to happen to strengthen our economic recovery, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to look at the political calendar to decide, well, if this is what the economy needs -- helping small businesses get an infusion of capital, cutting investment taxes on small businesses -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to delay doing that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I will say this. \xc2\xa0I think the delay is the politics that are -- that get played by some on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this a hundred times and I\'ll add one more to it. \xc2\xa0If at any point in the last two years you listen to what is said on the floor of the Senate, it would be mind-boggling to think that Republican senators that voted against legislation yesterday, based on their support for cutting taxes for small business, and increasing the amount of capital that they have access to it, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in a hundred years bet they\xe2\x80\x99d be opposed to it.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn fact, the very argument that they make on extending the tax cuts for the wealthy are what? \xc2\xa0Helping small business. \xc2\xa0That was yesterday. \xc2\xa0That was yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s vote. \xc2\xa0And yet despite using one argument to prop up one political act, for some reason that same logic didn\xe2\x80\x99t carry to something else.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President regret, though, that some of the small business aspects were not included in the original stimulus last year, feeling like we\xe2\x80\x99d be further along with job development at this point?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, some of the expensing, the 50 percent expensing that was in the small business legislation for 2010, was in the 2009 Recovery Act. \xc2\xa0In fact, it was -- it\xe2\x80\x99s such a fairly non-controversial idea, it was actually in effect in 2008 as part of the prior administration.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So, again, I think, Mike, your question is a perfect example of, can people put politics aside to do what they support and what is right to strengthen the economy? \xc2\xa0Yesterday I think 61 -- there were 61 \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d votes for doing exactly that -- putting aside politics and doing what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the economy. \xc2\xa0There were 38 people that said, no, we can\xe2\x80\x99t put aside politics to help small business. \xc2\xa0That is, regrettably, where we are in our political system. \xc2\xa0It should not be where we are in helping the businesses that we know create jobs get the help that they need and deserve.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The City of Los Angeles Controller did an audit, says two of the agencies that got $111 million of Recovery Act funds have only created 55 jobs so far -- about $2 million a job. \xc2\xa0Does the President find that upsetting, outrageous --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I would have to get -- I have not seen the report from the Controller. \xc2\xa0I\'d have to get some information from the Recovery Act guys.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0Just a quick follow-up on the Ms. Warren issue. \xc2\xa0When will the public start to see the intended benefits of the legislation? \xc2\xa0And will it hinder their ability to receive those benefits if there\xe2\x80\x99s no director --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, look, again, there is a process of setting this up. \xc2\xa0Right now the rulemaking function of -- the rulemaking function of the agencies that will be drawn into what will eventually be the CFPB lie in those agencies and departments right now and will continue to.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I do think it is regrettable, Mike, that regardless of who we nominated, that nomination would likely have taken months and months and months. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole separate line of important questions about why the basic function of our government takes so very long to confirm. \xc2\xa0Just this week we confirmed a judge after nearly 300 days of waiting. \xc2\xa0You cannot function like this. \xc2\xa0There is certainly an \xe2\x80\x9cadvise and consent\xe2\x80\x9d -- a very important provision. \xc2\xa0It is not \xe2\x80\x9cadvise, delay and consent.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It should not be -- it should not be that way.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Elizabeth will start -- she was here today, obviously, and will start bright and early on Monday, standing up an agency that I think consumers will begin to see the benefits of very quickly.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of politics, the former Governor of Alaska, Ms. Sarah Palin, will be in Iowa this evening for a --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0A beautiful state. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You have some experience there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I love Iowa.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the past, you and even the President --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And ethanol. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0More fried food, but, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with the ethanol too, Mark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the past, the President has been, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, dismissive of some of her expertise in particular areas or perhaps her expertise in general. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt at this point that she is a very politically influential and powerful person that could -- the result of her endorsements could influence what you do from here from the White House, depending on the composition of the Congress. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, given the fact that she is going to Iowa, given the fact there is going to be speculation about a possible run for President, does the President view her as a political threat?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say this, Mike, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President has up until this point or does currently spend a lot of time thinking about the political season of 2012. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99d all admit we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of the 2010 election season, but 2012 is a long way away. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President spends a lot of time thinking about this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any doubt that she -- we saw this in 2008. \xc2\xa0She can rally a -- the very conservative elements of the Republican base. \xc2\xa0That was I think, as you mentioned, quite clear in her ability to impact who becomes the nominee in Delaware or in other places around the country. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s in any doubt. \xc2\xa0We saw her ability to draw quite big crowds. \xc2\xa0I don\'t doubt that the Republican Party fundraiser will be quite the recipient of that big crowd tonight. \xc2\xa0And she drew -- she\xe2\x80\x99s always drawn big crowds back to 2008.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 At some point, if she decides to become a contestant for President of the United States, there will be a whole series of questions that each has to go through and answer for the people of Iowa, the people of New Hampshire, and throughout this country.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a healthy process to go through. \xc2\xa0I think -- I will say Iowa is a great place to start it. \xc2\xa0I think most of the people in here have probably been to more events than they can remember in a place like Iowa. \xc2\xa0You are -- you stand up there with a microphone and you call on caucus-goers and answer their questions, and you have to build support and a following very methodically. \xc2\xa0It takes a lot of time.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But I have no doubt that she is a formidable force in the Republican Party, and may well be, in all honesty, the most formidable force in the Republican Party right now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you interpret this trip tonight as the first step in a run for President?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I like Iowa. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great place. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s normally around this time of year you go to dip your toe in the water, and my guess is that President Obama about this time in 2006 did I think what would be considered a somewhat analogous event. \xc2\xa0And that\'s my guess is, is she\xe2\x80\x99s going to dip that toe in.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, in starting up the bureau, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Elizabeth Warren going to be director in everything but title?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, obviously, there are legal functions that a director and only a director can perform. \xc2\xa0The President will, with the help of Elizabeth Warren, find somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s qualified to do that. \xc2\xa0But there are a host of things that have to be done, again, to functionally set a bureau up. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a group, as I said, working at the Department of Treasury under -- as stipulated by the law to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0She was named to two jobs. \xc2\xa0Will she get double pay?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0If that was the case, I would be busy writing my memo to be hired by three additional departments. \xc2\xa0No, she will report to and work for the Department of Treasury. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s paid by the Department of Treasury. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact amount, but she\xe2\x80\x99s paid at the level comparable to an Under Secretary of Treasury.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I noticed the other day the President re-nominated Donald Berwick for the Medicare/Medicaid post, even after the recess appointment. \xc2\xa0Is he looking for a confirmation during a lame-duck session?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, we -- obviously a recess appointment only takes you so long.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The end of next year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0And we believe that this is somebody who deserves a full confirmation. \xc2\xa0Again, I\'d go back to the -- an unfortunate thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened along the way of trying to create a government, and that is virtual gridlock in getting very important folks into important jobs. \xc2\xa0And it is a process that has to be fixed. \xc2\xa0And I say that not as a Democrat or Republican, but just the simple functions of what we as Americans expect out of our government are hard to do without the people there to do that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So can he act as the recess appointee director when he is up as the nominee for the same job?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, under the laws of recess appointments.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He can?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Dodd said today that until a director is named to head the consumer agency, it will have no teeth. \xc2\xa0So, I mean, what kind of sense of urgency -- you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take months to get someone actually approved.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take months to get somebody through a process. \xc2\xa0Again, that is the sad reality of where we are, whether it is in appointing somebody as non-controversial as the GSA; judges go through the committee process unanimously, they get voted out 70-something to 20-something -- it only takes 300 days, which is I think nothing short of ridiculous.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So following on Mike\xe2\x80\x99s question --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But I will say this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the important function of -- again, the rulemaking function of agencies that will be collapsed into the CFPB continues with those agencies, but there are a lot of important functions that Elizabeth can do in setting this up and in beginning the process of putting our laws and our regulations back on the side of consumers.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Anything in particular that consumers will be able to see before --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll send out some stuff on that, yes. \xc2\xa0Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see people -- there -- the functions of this I think will be felt by consumers rather quickly.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what are the administration\xe2\x80\x99s goals going into next week, into the U.N. meeting next week?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll -- the President I think has a number of important meetings -- I mentioned three here this afternoon -- one with China, one with Japan and one with a larger group of Asian nations. \xc2\xa0I think many of the issues that we talked about last year at the United Nations remain on the docket: \xc2\xa0concern about Iran, concern about North Korea. \xc2\xa0Obviously we go having made progress yesterday on a START treaty that we still believe that the Senate will ratify before the end of the year and mark an important accomplishment on both nations\xe2\x80\x99 path towards reducing our stockpile of nuclear weapons.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We will have a longer briefing call on Monday to walk through the longer list of scheduled events that the President will take part in, additional bilateral meetings that he will participate in.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what about China\xe2\x80\x99s currency? \xc2\xa0Will that come up also? \xc2\xa0How important is that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I anticipate that issues around the global economy will be mentioned.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, do you have the topics of discussion for the bilats planned?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me -- I\'ll get that and we\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot that out.*</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, last week in Wisconsin, Ohio, and again yesterday in Connecticut, the President has been using some language about Social Security, protecting Social Security. \xc2\xa0Who is that directed at?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, you have -- there are candidates that are -- well, there are candidates out there now that are discussing privatization, going back to the ideas -- I think proving the point that the President discusses going back to some of the ideas that were had in 2005 by the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, there are some candidates that are out there that want to go way past privatizing Social Security and just do away with the whole darn thing. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that ensuring that a very successful idea is there for future generations is something that will be debated in this election and certainly in years to come.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, Robert, one more question on the General Assembly. \xc2\xa0There was some talk of the President -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned New START -- the President attending a fissile materials treaty meeting also. \xc2\xa0Do you know if that\xe2\x80\x99s on the list or not?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Peter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and I think what others in the administration have said on this. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the Chief of Staff is going to take some time to make a decision. \xc2\xa0He talked about earlier this year and talked about -- has talked about in the past his interest in that job. \xc2\xa0Those of us who\xe2\x80\x99ve spent time in Chicago understand why. \xc2\xa0He will, I presume, over the course of the next little bit make that decision and announce what it is.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I will say -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly said this before but it bears repeating -- and that is we start each morning and we end each day with meetings in the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office, as we should. \xc2\xa0Those meetings are focused on our tasks at hand, not on some decisions that he needs to make.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he make his announcement to the Tribune Washington bureau specifically? \xc2\xa0Or will he more generally -- (Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check and see if any of my friends from the Sun Times are here. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work out -- that\'s, I understand, a sticky political question which I am not dare going to wade into.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Glenn.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, was anything wrong with Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s voice today? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0We noticed that she didn\'t say anything at the announcement, and I was wondering why.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s got a busy TV schedule here this afternoon. \xc2\xa0I spent some time talking to her and she appeared fine. \xc2\xa0But I will pass along your cares and concerns. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We have some lozenges downstairs. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Excellent.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question about sort of the Chief of Staff. \xc2\xa0Do you think Tom Donilon would make a good Chief of Staff?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I -- (laughter) -- that\'s good. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you credit for that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Or any other suggestions you might have. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Should I just start rattling off a few names? \xc2\xa0Let me say this. \xc2\xa0There are a number of talented people in the event that the President need to make -- needed to make that decision, Glenn. \xc2\xa0I think it is important -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to get ahead of a decision that the current Chief of Staff makes. \xc2\xa0I think -- again, I think that that\'s a decision that the President will ultimately have to make in the event that Rahm decides to run for mayor. \xc2\xa0But there just isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of time that I have seen or been involved in, in addressing that question up into this point.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, are any sort of conversations going on in terms of prepping for the eventuality? \xc2\xa0He occupies a huge space in the West Wing. \xc2\xa0I mean, clearly you guys must be talking about what you might do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, look, I don\'t doubt that at some place there may be planning going on for a whole host of things. \xc2\xa0I will say this, Glenn. \xc2\xa0To say that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken up even a marginal amount of time, I think, would be inaccurate. \xc2\xa0There are -- Lord knows there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s enough stuff on our plate to keep us busy far past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon and well into this weekend. \xc2\xa0Our current Chief of Staff normally jokes that Friday presents just two more work days until Monday. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s the mindset that we have and we will see what decisions need to be made based on decisions that the current Chief of Staff might make.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0First of all, let me say thank you again for getting back to me so promptly on Tuesday about the advance the President received for his books. \xc2\xa0Is he going to donate the remainder of the advance to the cause that the publishers mentioned, the scholarship fund?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m relying a little bit on my memory here, but the advance for --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For three books.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0-- for the children\xe2\x80\x99s book, which on a contract signed in December of \xe2\x80\x9904, I think, was $200,000. \xc2\xa0If I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, that advance is split three ways. \xc2\xa0The second and third portions of that are received at the completion of a manuscript and at publication, so all of that $200,000, along with the proceeds from the sale of the book, will go to a charity.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that will be about what time?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can check on the advance. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the proceeds for the book -- I\xe2\x80\x99m now going back on memory on a book tour in 2006 -- accrue and at some point will be given out to the charity. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The other thing I wanted to ask you was right now we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the start of the trial of a very influential lobbyist, Paul Magliocchetti, who had great contacts throughout the Democratic Party. \xc2\xa0Did the President ever meet him when he was a senator or President?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ring a bell, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any knowledge that he did. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He worked for John Murtha for many years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound familiar.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So from a pragmatic perspective and a governance perspective, I can definitely understand why President Obama would want to have Elizabeth Warren in this position of standing up the agency. \xc2\xa0But as a constitutional law expert with a long view of history, does he have any concerns that the partisan nature of the times has -- is creating a situation where more power is consolidated inside the White House beyond the scope of confirmation and --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Based on what --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, like, okay, so for example, like John Brennan maybe could or could not have been confirmed, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be, right? \xc2\xa0Or in another -- let\xe2\x80\x99s say the next President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me just -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take a few of these examples at a time. \xc2\xa0The legislation that the Senate and the House passed and the President signed on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides that the Department of Treasury has the sole responsibility in setting up this bureau.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know, I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s legal. \xc2\xa0I get that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking a different question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I guess -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I don\'t think we should just skate by the \xe2\x80\x9cwe get that it\xe2\x80\x99s legal\xe2\x80\x9d because I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that\'s where the job responsibilities derive from.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 In terms of John Brennan, John holds a position quite similar to a job that was held by Fran Townsend and others in a previous administration because -- you know, look, you have a Director of National Intelligence, you have a CIA, you have NCTC, you have other agencies that John helps to coordinate on behalf of the President. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t -- John\xe2\x80\x99s role, Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s role, are not either out of bounds in terms of the law or the Constitution.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you finish in a second, but, look, do I think that -- and this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t relate to what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying on consolidated job responsibilities inside the White House, but I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt and no one should doubt that this -- the confirmation process is -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s not broken, it is severely damaged, and it has -- and it does affect the pace at which our judges are confirmed, our nominees are confirmed, to the point of slowing down I think the important functions of our government. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad state, and it should be repaired on a bipartisanship basis.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because that -- I mean that\'s my question. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to say that the President is doing something wrong. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, are Presidents nowadays forced into a situation where they have to basically consolidate decision-making inside the White House beyond the reach of senators being able to grill someone in committee sessions because the confirmation process makes it not worth going through that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say this, I don\'t think that -- I don\'t think the positions that were either -- that have been constructed in the past for whatever administration, I think are -- I don\'t see them as sort of structured outside the -- outside that process. \xc2\xa0I think obviously some functions have -- look, John provides, as Fran Townsend did, important information and policy information and policy coordination on counterterrorism, which is something that has increased in importance over the past few years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But every government depends on an able and capable functioning Cabinet to provide the President with advice on issues but also on running the everyday functions of a government. \xc2\xa0Look, I think if you look back at -- take you back to -- in April in the oil spill, you had -- look, without a functioning government, you have the Department of Interior that has purview over the well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Coast Guard that has purview over the water, the EPA which has purview over the land and the air. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of functions that are performed in a normal structure of government.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two days I asked about a Washington Post report, whether the administration --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know where I am on that answer, but let me ask again today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because you said you were going to check. \xc2\xa0Thanks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say, David, not -- sometimes the bureaucracy does not cooperate with said Press Secretary, but I will --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You got back so quickly to him. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I had the answer to his question. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go find the answer to your question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Ken, and then I\'ll come over.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, is there any discussion yet in the White House about any kind of disaster assistance to New York after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinger of God\xe2\x80\x9d storm up there?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say normally, Ken, the -- I don\'t know if the state of New York has or the city has, through the state, asked for or petitioned for a disaster declaration. \xc2\xa0Normally those disaster declarations come through the process into FEMA from the state, and I\xe2\x80\x99m unclear if the state has asked for assistance on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Unrelated, any discussions inside the White House about perhaps finding a position for Mayor Fenty?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0None that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard. \xc2\xa0None that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0The President is concerned about the North Korea, you said earlier, and the President will hold a bilateral talk with China and Japan. \xc2\xa0Why not then the President hold meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, I don\'t -- let me -- I don\'t have a full schedule of bilateral meetings in front of me for next week, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if South Korea is on that list or not. \xc2\xa0Give us a little bit more time and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some information.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0Afghan elections this weekend, a lot of violence targeting Afghan candidates. \xc2\xa0First, is the President concerned about some of the escalated violence recently undermining the elections? \xc2\xa0And secondly, has there been any concern that a lot of these polling sites are predominantly Pashtun areas of the country?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'ll say this. \xc2\xa0The security of and the function of the elections occupied a decent space of the time that the President -- when the President and his team met earlier in the week in the Situation Room. \xc2\xa0They discussed specifically ensuring that there was security -- a significant security apparatus in place and there are, as you mentioned, very serious security concerns in many areas in the country. \xc2\xa0We know that there are those that will seek to draw attention by disrupting these important elections. \xc2\xa0That was something that General Petraeus and the team discussed with the President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There -- in terms of other concerns, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s fraud monitoring, things like that, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s -- we have -- ISAF and others have worked with bodies and committees that have been established to monitor any fraud claims and to deal with any of those complaints expeditiously. \xc2\xa0I know we did a background call on this yesterday.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that while we are monitoring for fraud and while we have serious concerns about safety and security, we do look forward to successful elections. \xc2\xa0I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand there are I think more than 2,500 candidates seeking a little less than 250 posts in one -- in the lower house. \xc2\xa0So understand that on average you have 10 candidates for one job, nine aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to win.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You thought Iowa was bad --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Exactly. \xc2\xa0So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a functioning arrangement to deal with fraud and complaints. \xc2\xa0I do think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have nine people that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get as many votes as one is, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a number of claims. \xc2\xa0We take those claims seriously, but we think that the Afghans have set up a structure to provide for a successful election.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The fact that there is not going to be polling stations, particularly in Pashtun areas, people in the toughest areas of Afghanistan -- areas that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that in itself just undermine the election effort right there?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I mean, again, I think the Afghans have done a commendable job in setting up as best as they can a structure for a fair and important election. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what will happen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 George.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could I follow on that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back over there in one second.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Whitehouse came out of a meeting with the President yesterday saying the President had told him he was really relishing the fight over taxes; that he\xe2\x80\x99d be there all the way with them. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about what he told them? \xc2\xa0And is this something where he is going to go all the way through; he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to cut a compromise on -- that will surprise the senators?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, George, I think the President -- I think there is a compromise to be had. \xc2\xa0There is, if it will just be taken. \xc2\xa0And the President has outlined that. \xc2\xa0The President believes that we must make permanent the tax cuts for those in the middle class, for those that make less than $250,000 a year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 As I understand, the -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s taken a bit to get back to the position that they held last week. \xc2\xa0There was a bit of a kerfuffle on Sunday and Saturday at what the position was earlier in the week. \xc2\xa0It appears as if Mr. Boehner has gone back to the position he had before he taped \xe2\x80\x9cFace the Nation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And that is, he wants the middle-class tax cuts and the tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President believes that there is perfect compromise. \xc2\xa0We agree on the middle class and they say they want the middle class. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s get the middle class done. \xc2\xa0We can get that done this week. \xc2\xa0We can get that done -- or we can get that done next week. \xc2\xa0 And then, let\xe2\x80\x99s leave what is -- what we disagree on for later to debate. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to debate that. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s provide the certainty that is needed for middle-class families that, as you heard the President discuss today, have been hit hard over the past decade.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And I will say this, to go back to my America versus Washington analogy here, almost everywhere else in the country except a little place called Washington would two sides agreeing on a big chunk of this not be viewed as the perfect way to move this issue forward. \xc2\xa0I agree. \xc2\xa0You agree. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s agree on what we agree on. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s move that forward. \xc2\xa0And let\xe2\x80\x99s take what we disagree on and save that for another time to debate, because we do know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got until the 31st of December to have that longer debate. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s provide the certainty for middle-class families right now by extending those middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Senator Whitehouse\xe2\x80\x99s point that the President said he really relishes this fight?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think that -- I think the President believes that this, in many ways, illuminates the choices that we have in this election. \xc2\xa0And that is -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s our -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a group that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that wants to address spending, yet I have yet to hear a good argument for borrowing $700 billion to extend tax cuts for the upper end. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole series of choices that each side is going to make in this, and I think it highlights a lot of what we see.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Sam, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back over there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This week, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Vice President on the \xe2\x80\x9cRachel Maddow\xe2\x80\x9d show, and some of the comments the President made last night seemed to be aimed at making sure that liberals who may or may not be disappointed with the pace of some of the policies here turn out to vote in November. \xc2\xa0Does this reflect a concern on the part of the White House that the base isn\xe2\x80\x99t in line for November?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think in fact Vice President Biden had a long scheduled interview with Rachel Maddow that had to be cancelled at one point, and I think fortuitously for them, fell the day after the Delaware election.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, the President is going to make an appeal in this election season to everybody in this country, not just one political party and not just one ideological bent. \xc2\xa0The steps that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to strengthen the economy and address many of the fundamental problems that our country has faced for many years, that\'s a case that he wants to make to the whole of the country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should we expect to see any events or language specifically, though, targeting some of these groups who --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I guess in that regard I would point you to the schedule that the DNC earlier released on some specific events the President will do, not next week but starting the week after and into the election season.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 You had an Afghan question and then a tax question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, presumably a tax question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, on Afghanistan, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got something like 15 percent of the polling places have already been closed. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Taliban warning people not to vote. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve got less international monitors than you had in the elections last year. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve got people terrified to vote and they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting a very low turnout. \xc2\xa0Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this mean that the legitimacy of the election is in doubt?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would disagree with that. \xc2\xa0Look, the Taliban terrorizes people in Afghanistan every single day, okay? \xc2\xa0Their terrorizing people in that country is not simply reserved for near an election. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re -- is a brutal regime that wishes to do the people of Afghanistan harm every single day. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the people of Afghanistan don\'t want to see them return to the position of power that they had. \xc2\xa0That\'s why these elections are so important.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Of course the brutal minority of the Taliban would seek to do anything it possibly could to undermine these elections. \xc2\xa0I think you will see brave Afghans disregard the thuggish warnings of a brutal regime and instead cast their votes, as I said, in a very important election. \xc2\xa0We will monitor that election and others will monitor that election as we go down the road of progress in Afghanistan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On middle-class tax cuts, you mentioned a compromise. \xc2\xa0Well, a few days ago you said there was an overlap in this area. \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the only overlap be the first two years, because you have people that want it -- the administration wants it permanently -- but there are others who say we can only afford it for two years. \xc2\xa0So isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real compromise, the real overlap, just extending them for a few years --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the real compromise is moving forward on the middle-class tax cuts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve also said -- I mean, if I can put my decoder ring on here for a minute -- the first -- the overlap is --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Do you have a decoder ring? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) That\'s the coolest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a mood ring.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Bill ate Cracker Jacks and told me he had a decoder ring, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really believe him.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tGo ahead.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, all right. \xc2\xa0The second part of my decoder ring is now you, in the last few days, you keep saying you have until December to -- the end of December, while the fiscal commission comes out with its reports December 1. \xc2\xa0If they were to throw up their hands, which some expect them to do, and say, we can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to do long-term, medium-term deficit reduction, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that really bring the affordability into question for doing anything beyond two years?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, the President has stated his position on the middle class. \xc2\xa0My mentioning the 31st of December was not to preclude what the fiscal commission may or may not bring to the table, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to prejudge what they may or may not say. \xc2\xa0That was simply to mention that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some time left in this year before the tax cuts legally expire, as part of the 2001 legislation, to deal with areas that are of disagreement. \xc2\xa0But it only makes sense before Congress leaves to agree -- to vote on and to pass what it appears as if most sides agree upon, and that\'s the middle class.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I do not think -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say this on a number of occasions -- we should not hold hostage the middle class, as some want to see the high-end tax cuts extended for a series of years or made permanent. \xc2\xa0That doesn\'t make sense. \xc2\xa0It certainly doesn\'t make sense in what we can afford. \xc2\xa0But most of all it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense in what we know we both agree on.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move forward on what we agree on. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s not hold the middle class hostage. \xc2\xa0That would provide some needed and important certainty for middle-class families that have seen their incomes drop over the course of the last 10 years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, would it be holding them hostage if everybody agrees at least to extend it for two years?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear on moving forward on those middle-class tax cuts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHave a good weekend, guys.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa03:17 P.M.
