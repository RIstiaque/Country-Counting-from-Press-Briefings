Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:05 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s Friday already.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something we can celebrate.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me do a quick announcement that you may have already seen a little bit about, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, February 10th, nine years after he announced his candidacy for President, President Obama will return to the place where his political career -- or his national political career began by traveling to Springfield, Illinois.\xc2\xa0As a state senator, Barack Obama spent each day in the Illinois State Capitol working in good faith with folks from all walks of life -- Democrats and Republicans and independents -- representing good people of every ethnicity and faith, determined to do\xc2\xa0right by the people of the state where he made his home.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as a United States senator from Illinois, Barack Obama chose the steps of the old state capitol where Abraham Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together to ask Americans to join him in the unfinished business of perfecting\xc2\xa0our union.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, in the final year of his second term, President Obama looks forward to addressing the Illinois General Assembly on February 10th about what we can do together as a country to build a better politics, and one that reflects our\xc2\xa0better selves.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that should be an interesting event that\xe2\x80\x99s a week from this coming Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, Josh, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about Iranian state media reporting that they had flown a drone -- surveillance drone over some type of a U.S. ship to conduct some surveillance.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you have any evidence that backs that up?\xc2\xa0And does the U.S. consider that to be a provocative act?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these reports, as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for any -- for an assessment of whether or not any significant risk was perceived in that action.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They can give you a better sense of\xc2\xa0sort of how worrisome something like this is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And on another concerning issue of North Korea, I wanted to see if you could give us an update on the latest U.S. thinking about what the best approach is to responding to that testing incident.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems that some of our partners\xc2\xa0in other countries that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get to put pressure on North Korea are concerned that if we push too hard with sanctions, it could actually destabilize North Korea and lead to even worse situations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So is there -- would the goal of additional U.S.\xc2\xa0sanctions be to put more economic pressure on Pyongyang, or to actually try and see a new type of government there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Josh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how the nuclear test that the North Koreans conducted earlier this month was inconsistent with their international obligations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And North Korea\'s pursuit of a larger nuclear weapons stockpile\xc2\xa0and a potentially more dangerous nuclear weapons stockpile only serves to destabilize the broader region.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the broader region -- all the large countries in the broader region have called on them to stop doing it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that certainly has been the position of the United States and our allies, Japan and South Korea.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But that position has also been echoed by Russia and China, including when President Xi attended a state dinner\xc2\xa0here at the White House.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the news conference that he conducted with President Obama in the Rose Garden, he reiterated the Chinese commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we support and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to\xc2\xa0work effectively with the Chinese in pursuit of that goal.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in diplomacy with them to have a discussion about the best way for us to try to achieve that goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Kerry was in China earlier this week discussing that particular issue.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I know that his deputy, Tony Blinken, was traveling in the region within the last couple of weeks to discuss this issue.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And, look,\xc2\xa0the situation with North Korea, as evidenced by the fact that this is something that President Obama and President Xi talked about at the White House last fall, I think is an indication that this issue ranks highly on our agenda any time that senior U.S. officials\xc2\xa0sit down with their Chinese counterparts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reason for that is simply that China has as close relations with North Korea as any other country does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have been in conversations with China about how they, in coordination with the international community, can apply more pressure to the North Koreans to get them to comply with international obligations --\xc2\xa0or at least come to the negotiating table to have a discussion about how they can become at least a little less isolated.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those conversations continue, and we continue to look for the best way to apply pressure to the North Korean regime to come into compliance with the kinds of international standards that just about everybody else follows.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the National Security Council met with the President last night.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this point, has the President been presented with the suggestions from his advisors that he send additional troops either into Iraq or Syria, Special Forces?\xc2\xa0And any update on his thinking on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Josh, the President meets regularly with his national security team to discuss our efforts against ISIL.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And they did have the opportunity to do that again just yesterday.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s message to his national security\xc2\xa0team has consistently been to look for ways to intensify those elements of our strategy that are already showing some progress.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the President and his team have made some announcements in recent months that are consistent with that strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing that we have seen, in particular, is that conducting raids against certain targets have been successful in taking some ISIL leaders off the battlefield and allowing the United States to obtain important intelligence information\xc2\xa0that can then be used to further our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We know that that\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that has allowed us to make some progress.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And at the end of last year, the President and his national security team announced our intent\xc2\xa0to deploy additional troops and to ramp up that element of our strategy by creating essentially these expeditionary task forces that could be positioned to carry out these kinds of raids on relatively short notice.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of how the President\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0team has followed through on the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated goal of intensifying those elements of our strategy that are already starting to yield some progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Carter did an interview with NPR that aired today, where he noted that this is exactly the instruction that he has received from the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And each time that Secretary Carter has presented to the\xc2\xa0President a specific plan for intensifying one element of our strategy that has already shown some progress, the President has approved it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think that is an indication that the President is quite serious about accomplishing our goal of degrading and\xc2\xa0ultimately destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I would note that that\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit different than the deployment of tens of thousands of U.S. ground combat troops to go and occupy large territory in Iraq or in Syria.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0think that that would be useful in advancing our broader strategic objective.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary of Defense doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very good idea either.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not a recommendation that our Secretary of Defense or our uniformed military leadership\xc2\xa0have made to the President.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But when they have made recommendations that are consistent with intensifying our strategy, that every time the President has approved them.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So has the Secretary of Defense made specific recommendations -- in this case, for Libya -- about that strategy that you just talked about sending expeditionary Special Forces to de-raid on such short notice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reference that I made to the expeditionary task forces was a reference to an announcement that we made at the end of last year about Iraq.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any decisions to announce about our efforts in Libya.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously,\xc2\xa0we\xe2\x80\x99ve been mindful for some time about the strategy that we know ISIL uses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We know that ISIL is constantly on the lookout for areas where they can capitalize on political chaos and try to establish a foothold in a country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And obviously, Libya is a country\xc2\xa0that is going through some turmoil right now.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our strategy in Libya is consistent with the strategy that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us employ in other places, which is to be strongly supportive of ongoing diplomatic efforts to try to resolve the political situation in Libya while also preserving\xc2\xa0a capacity to take military strikes where necessary to push back against an ISIL threat.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And back in November, the United States military carried out an airstrike in Libya that took the leading ISIL leader figure in Libya off the battlefield.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think\xc2\xa0that should be an indication to you that we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the risk that ISIL poses to Libya.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to confront it -- continue to confront it in the way that we have now for many months.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And have the recent attacks in Libya on oil facilities sort of spurred the need to consider more action or a range of options of action there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, again, there are -- unfortunately, Libya is a country that has -- that is in political turmoil, and that has led to a lot of violence.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re of course concerned about that situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a country that\xc2\xa0is struggling to put together the kind of central government that can actually exercise control over the entire government and provide for the security situation in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has been strongly supportive of the U.N.-led effort to try to build up a central government that reflects the views of the diverse population of that country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so we continue to be mindful of the risk that ISIL</p>\n<p>\n\tposes to areas where there is some political chaos, but also mindful of the need to support the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done to establish an effective central government there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And lastly, just briefly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before that the President has hoped to meet face to face with Speaker Ryan relatively soon.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I know it\xe2\x80\x99s just 10 days until the budget is released.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether that meeting\xc2\xa0is going to happen soon, or do you have any news on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s in the week ahead.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next week -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll just jump ahead.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me make sure I get this part right.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next Tuesday, I believe, the President will meet with both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to discuss legislative\xc2\xa0priorities for the coming year.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Building on the bipartisan budget agreement that the President signed into law last year, we certainly believe that there are areas of cooperation for the year ahead.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we are going to have a discussion, and the President\xc2\xa0will have a discussion with Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan about opportunities to work together to deliver for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why has it taken so long to have the chance to meet with Speaker Ryan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been in a discussion with him since the beginning of the year about setting up this meeting.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been a busy couple of weeks; obviously the State of the Union address, or --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Snow days.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There have been some snow days.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There have been at least a couple weeks where Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been in session.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this is the opportunity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to meet, and the President is looking forward to the conversation.\xc2\xa0Again, based on the success that we had last year in finding some common ground to advance a whole range of shared priorities, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty to talk about this year, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The DHS IG today released logs from the Secret Service showing that their radios had experienced technical issues some 100 times over the last 11 months.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congressman Chaffetz in response said that DHS and Secret Service had gotten\xc2\xa0more money than they had requested, especially for this, and so this was more evidence of mismanagement at the agency.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how you kind of respond to that and why the Secret Service hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get their radios working.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the IG report, Justin, but obviously we can take a look at the findings of that report and see if we can get you a response.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Labor Department today sent over its fiduciary rule to OMB.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you anticipate OMB sort of expediting that -- their consideration of that rule, and if you could kind of lay out a timeline.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Embedded in it is\xc2\xa0an eight-month sort of windup process, and so if you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of seeing that by the end of the year be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, this is obviously something that the administration and the Department of Labor in particular has been hard at work on.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I was just looking through some of the stats here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This rule has been subject to public comment\xc2\xa0for more than five months now, and there were four days of public hearings that were convened to discuss the potential consequences of this rule.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I know that the Department of Labor received more than 3,000 comments and hosted about 100 meetings to discuss\xc2\xa0the rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the President has made this a priority because being able to save for retirement is part of the kind of American Dream that every middle-class family aspires to.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And saving for a retirement where you can continue to live out\xc2\xa0your golden years in dignity without placing an undue burden on your kids I think is something that, again, that every American worker aspires to.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd right now, based on the way that the laws are written -- or based on the way that the rules are written, there are estimates that up to $17 billion each year in retirement savings is lost because some financial advisors don\xe2\x80\x99t act\xc2\xa0consistent with the best financial interests of their clients.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I know that there are some who complain that a rule like this could be overly burdensome, but this does not place a single additional burden on a financial advisor that is acting in the best interest of their client.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re\xc2\xa0doing the right thing and you\xe2\x80\x99re a financial advisor, then you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything differently than you\xe2\x80\x99re already doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I think this falls pretty clearly in the common-sense category.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact timeframe to lay out for you about when this would be implemented, but obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re working aggressively to work through the process,\xc2\xa0incorporate the input, be receptive to the feedback that we receive, but also put in place a regulation that is clearly in the best interest of those workers who are trying to do the right thing by saving for their retirement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Senators Boxer and Feinstein introduced an amendment today that would require the Energy Department to kind of convene and lead a task force looking into the methane leak in California outside of L.A.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have\xc2\xa0a stance on that amendment specifically, but also why -- I mean, this has been kind of an ongoing environmental catastrophe -- why we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President speak about this or any kind action out of the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the details of the amendment that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do know, however, that the EPA has been focused on the situation in California for quite some time now.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve been working closely with California\xc2\xa0officials providing some environmental expertise to try to guide the response to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President talk about it publicly either, but I know that the President is aware of this issue.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the best-informed, most-empowered experts in the federal government aren\xe2\x80\x99t just aware of this issue,\xc2\xa0they\xe2\x80\x99ve been actively working on it for some time now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last one, because it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President, when he was talking to House Dems behind closed doors yesterday, seemed to suggest that although he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they had the sort of the legislative capacity to do it, that if they\xc2\xa0were able to pass legislation reclassifying marijuana, that he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to sign it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is a shift in position for him.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could flesh out sort his thinking there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, let me first compliment you on your Friday reference.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that was very clever.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For those who are fans of that cult classic, you\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate how clever Justin was in asking that question.\xc2\xa0I did not attend the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll explain it to you after the briefing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He doesn\'t have anything to do.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So -- that was another joke.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You can explain that one to him, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can you add it to the transcript?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do on that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I didn\'t participate in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday, but I did get a readout of the meeting.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And my understanding is that it was a tongue-in-cheek response to the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are some in the Democratic Party who have urged the President to take this kind of action.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s response was if you feel so strongly about it, and you believe there\xe2\x80\x99s so much public support for what it is that\xc2\xa0you\'re advocating, then why don\'t you pass legislation about it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think that was the tenor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Does the President agree with the Vice President that the Republican presidential race is a \xe2\x80\x9cgift from the Lord\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Vice President has a well-established reputation for his colorful expressions like the one that you just cited there.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President has made clear that regardless of who Republicans nominate at this point, based\xc2\xa0on the rhetoric that we hear not just from the leading candidate, but from all of the leading candidates -- to the extent that there are multiples of them -- all are offering up the same kind of pessimism and doom and gloom that stands in stark contrast to\xc2\xa0the kind of optimism and energy and momentum that Democrats are running on.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that dynamic historically in politics plays pretty well for those who are running on optimism and the kind of can-do spirit that has infused American politics since the founding of our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But does he think that the Republicans -- or the state of the Republican race is at all making things easier for Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I think -- again, I didn\'t see the entirety of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I think his point is that the contrast offered up from the pessimism of the Republican candidates, again, creates a genuine opportunity\xc2\xa0for Democratic candidates that are interested in championing the interest of middle-class families and capitalizing on the momentum that our economy is showing, and building on what is best about America.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s observation is that that\'s\xc2\xa0a winning message, particularly when it comes in contrast with the doom and gloom that\'s being spread by the Republican Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Okay.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was a poll this week, though, that showed that 57 percent of Americans feel that things are going badly in this country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And when you see the doom and gloom rhetoric, as you describe it, getting maybe more of a groundswell\xc2\xa0than you would expect -- maybe in other years, I don\'t know; it seems to have taken a lot of people by surprise -- how are you so certain that optimism is going to really capture people when it seems based on these numbers that it\xe2\x80\x99s the pessimism that is the\xc2\xa0stronger feeling out there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\'s the beauty of these things.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There will be a contest.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There will be a long debate over the course of this year, and there will be an election in November.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll tally up the votes, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\xc2\xa0find out.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\'s the beauty of the process.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of this is clearly bias by my own experience.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the things I think that is particularly notable about the Iowa caucuses that are coming next week is you do see a lot of this effort by Republican candidates to try to exploitpeople\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBarack Obama, when he was running in Iowa, had yard signs all across the state.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his name on it; they had the word \xe2\x80\x9chope\xe2\x80\x9d on it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that message is what propelled him to not just an historic upset in the Iowa caucuses,\xc2\xa0it propelled him to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yeah, I guess I have a little bit of a bias here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I think there is a strong element of our political culture that is, at its core, optimistic; that this is a country that was founded on an ideal.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And ever since it was founded,\xc2\xa0we have been striving to make our union more perfect.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that is infused with the sense that we have the capacity to change and improve our country, and to build on the progress that we\'ve made, and to capitalize on the momentum that exists.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd particularly when you take a look at the amount of progress that we\'ve made over the last seven years, digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, when you compare the strength and\xc2\xa0durability of the U.S. economy to economies around the world, you quickly see why the United States is so well positioned.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we should take the challenges that we face lightly.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there isn\'t a whole lot more work\xc2\xa0to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody in this country, to do more to fight for the middle class -- sure, all those things are true.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we should feel confident about our ability not just to confront but to overcome those challenges, not by turning\xc2\xa0against one another or contradicting the kinds of values that were critical to the founding of this nation, but actually by drawing upon the strength of the American people and the strength of the values that have served our country so well over the last two\xc2\xa0centuries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\'s a lot of what you hear virtually every time the President goes somewhere and gives a speech.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He starts it out, of course, by listing all of the progress over the last seven years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So it must be frustrating\xc2\xa0when a poll comes out like that -- and we\'ve seen several over the last year -- where there does seem to be a sense that things are going badly.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So is it frustrating to you in the message that is being put out there, and to what do you account for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got 14 Republican candidates for president that are running around the country telling everybody that things are bad.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re spending tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions\xc2\xa0of dollars in advertising trying to convince people of that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\'s not surprising to me that that\'s having some kind of an effect.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact of the strength and durability of our economy, about the way that the rest of the world looks\xc2\xa0to the United States as a beacon of hope and opportunity and a source of strength.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that we\'re seeing higher graduation rates and higher percentages of students enrolling in college; that we\'re seeing health care inflation at an\xc2\xa0all-time low and the un-insurance rate -- or the rate of people who are uninsured at an all-time low</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous progress that this country has made.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And whether you consider domestic politics or our standing in the international community, there\xe2\x80\x99s just no denying those facts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I recognize that that\xc2\xa0makes it inconvenient for those who are peddling a lot of doom and gloom, but it does give the President optimism not just about the future of our country, but also the likelihood of success of politics candidates who are, frankly, aware of and prepared to\xc2\xa0capitalize on the momentum that our country has built up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does seem to tell you that the message isn\'t quite getting out, right?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, you list a lot of progress.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President lists a number of points every time he speaks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is there something you think that\xc2\xa0prevents that message from really registering?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what is clear is that there are 14 -- or however many there are now -- Republican candidates for president that are saying something a lot different, and they\xe2\x80\x99re spending a lot\xc2\xa0of time on the campaign trail and they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a lot of media attention, and they\xe2\x80\x99re spending a lot of time with their advertising campaigns making a different case.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, no, I\'m not particularly worried about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think we\'re actually focused on the results.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think the strength of the results speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And also the meeting that will happen on Tuesday -- because Mitch McConnell is going to be there -- is that going to count as the \xe2\x80\x9cbourbon summit\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My guess is that the meeting will take place either in the late morning or early afternoon.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\'ll get you some more updates on that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s prime time for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some offices, that may be true, but not in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, are you saying that this is going to be the bourbon summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No, I\'m saying it\'s not the bourbon summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we can continue to look forward to, at some point in the future, a bourbon summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You can continue to look forward to it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All right?</p>\n<p>\n\tGregory.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today we understand is the last day in office of the United States pardon attorney, whose job it is to recommend to the President clemency actions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s leaving a historic backlog of clemency applications\xc2\xa0-- 9,000 commutation applications, more than 1,000 pardons -- almost 1,000 pardon applications. Is the President at all concerned that his attempt to use his clemency power more rigorously in his last year in office is at all in jeopardy?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And is the White\xc2\xa0House considering any structural changes in how those clemency applications are processed in order to move this caseload forward?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this rate, it would take an entire another presidential administration -- two terms -- to get through that backlog of cases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, listen, the President is committed to the clemency process.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think some of the announcements that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from us over the last year or so I think are an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to use\xc2\xa0that process to make our system more fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe the most impactful thing -- the most impactful way to reform the system is for Congress to pass legislation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the President is working hard to try to nurture bipartisan agreement that would lead to criminal justice legislation\xc2\xa0-- criminal justice reform legislation passing the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be a leading advocate of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the President does have authority to grant clemency in cases that are reviewed by attorneys at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the President has been aggressive about using that authority over the course of the last\xc2\xa0year, and I would expect that in the year that remains -- that he remains in office, he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to look for opportunities to use that authority to make our system more fair.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about additional resources or any sort of\xc2\xa0restructuring, but based on the progress that we have made in both soliciting and approving clemency requests, I think the President is quite proud of his record thus far, but there is more that we intend to get done over the course of the next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State Department today is reportedly releasing only about 1,000 of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s remaining 9,000 emails that\xe2\x80\x99s in -- at least doesn\xe2\x80\x99t comport with the judge\xe2\x80\x99s order, ordering their release by today.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lawyers\xc2\xa0for your administration have asked to delay the release to the last day of February, which would be the day before the Super Tuesday primaries.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Does the public, especially the Democratic voting public, have the right to see Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails before\xc2\xa0they cast ballots?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I think no.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think the extraordinary request that Secretary Clinton put forward to actually release her emails is something that I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure has a precedent, at least for federal office holders.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the fact\xc2\xa0is, the Democratic primary voters, to the extent that they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in reading those emails -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure very many of them are -- but to the extent that they are, have already had the opportunity to review tens of thousands of them -- at least\xc2\xa0tens of thousands of pages of them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there is more work that needs to be done, and the State Department has been engaged in a rigorous process to ensure that the release of those emails is consistent with the standards that are laid out in the Freedom\xc2\xa0of Information Act. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd given the volume of material that they had to review, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to complete that work in the timeframe that was laid out by the judge, but they have a plan in place to complete that work as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I know\xc2\xa0they\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing that even as we speak.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You said it was her request to release these emails, but you concede that these are records the public is entitled to see under the Freedom of Information Act, right?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, this is part of an ongoing lawsuit.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s part of\xc2\xa0a long-delayed litigation into her records, which are public.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like she -- this was a judge\xe2\x80\x99s order.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Would you concede they\xe2\x80\x99re public records and they belong to the public?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would concede that they are public records that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act request, but that is different than proactively releasing all of them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No judge ordered her to do that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0She said that to\xc2\xa0demonstrate her commitment to transparency, that that\xe2\x80\x99s what she would do.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And this administration has devoted significant resources, because that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency, to try to fulfill that request.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd all of you and Democratic voters -- again, to the extent that any of them are interested in this -- have had ample opportunity to read thousands of pages of otherwise private correspondence.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So again, the State Department is going\xc2\xa0to work hard to fulfill both the request that was made by Secretary Clinton and consistent with the direction of the judge.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this correspondence, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some emails dealing with the way Secretary Clinton and her aides talk about dealing with sensitive or classified information, including an email where she asks an aide to transmit something non-secure.\xc2\xa0Another video surfaced that Fox found of Wendy Sherman, a top State Department official, saying that top diplomats were emailing things that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you would never see on an unclassified system.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Does the White House have any concerns about the attitude\xc2\xa0of the State Department or among the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s staff about classified information and sensitive information?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any of that reporting.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can tell you that certainly the President has made clear that the handling of sensitive information should be something that people are conscientious about.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly\xc2\xa0the case here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that Secretary Clinton and her team have said on a number of occasions that she neither sent nor received information on her private server that was stamped \xe2\x80\x9cclassified.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is consistent with the proper handling of sensitive\xc2\xa0materials.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo look, in the context of a presidential campaign, people are going to have a whole bunch of reasons to criticize any of the candidates, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that there are certain political opponents of Secretary Clinton\xc2\xa0that are looking for a way to use this situation to criticize her.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the process.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And she and her team I\xe2\x80\x99m confident will muster a robust defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the pay gap issue that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about this morning, just to be clear, the 79 cents on the dollar differential, how much of that does the administration now insist is the result of discrimination in the workplace versus\xc2\xa0larger societal issues?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is it still your intention -- your insistence that, in fact, discrimination plays a significant part in this discrepancy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard pressed to say that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play any role whatsoever.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exactly what percentage that is I think probably varies by position.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think there probably are some places where we do see some discrimination.\xc2\xa0I think there are a lot of places where you don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think this is precisely why the EEOC has announced today that they want to collect more information about this matter so that they can have much greater insight into what kind of pay gap exists by industry or at an individual\xc2\xa0company, and they can then draw better conclusions about both how to bridge that gap, but also see if there are ways to prevent it from happening in other places, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And this would apply to every company over 100 employees, from Comcast, dare I say, to Joe\xe2\x80\x99s whatever around the corner.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And you know the criticism of that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s onerous, some have described it as a fishing expedition, it\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You have existing anti-discrimination laws that are already on the books.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why does business need to do this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is just adding an additional component on a form that they already file every month or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s asking for a significantly different kind of qualitative kind of data -- not just race or gender.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s data that I think many people see as private.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that -- I know that there are at least some leaders in the business community, and you heard from Marc Benioff, at Salesforce, who says that this kind of transparency is actually good for running\xc2\xa0a business; that he is somebody who is known as a particularly effective chief executive.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of the fact that there was a pay gap, a gender pay gap at his company.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that by taking a closer look at the numbers, he was able to discern\xc2\xa0that there was some work that needed to be done in his own company to remedy that gap.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s a good thing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99d be the first to tell you that that was good for his business.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He didn\'t do that out of charity.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He believed that\'s an effective way to run his business.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do think that the request that the EEOC will now make of all these companies is consistent with good business practices.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the EEOC has a responsibility to make sure that they\'re rooting out discrimination\xc2\xa0where it exists.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so what they\'re asking for is additional information that will help them fulfill their mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the Flint situation and the Senate Democratic bill, what is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think you said yesterday that you\'re kind of waiting to see exactly what it says, or what is the -- because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about $600\xc2\xa0million, which is significant, and there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a great sense of urgency out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a significant sum of money, and it also includes some policy changes, as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we\'re carefully reviewing the proposal that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you is that we do believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for Congress to pass legislation that would give the city of Flint and the state of Michigan the resources that they need to address this situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the details,\xc2\xa0we\'re going to continue to work with Congress and take a look at the proposals that have been floated and see what might be most effective.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s taking a while to review something that a lot of people would like to see the President champion, get out in front of, if you will -- especially because there is still this enduring perception that the situation\xc2\xa0there isn\xe2\x80\x99t being taken seriously enough because it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor, minority\xc2\xa0community.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is the President sensitive to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard directly from the President himself that he takes this quite seriously.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think you could hear the emotion and passion in his voice when he was discussing it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think if you take a look\xc2\xa0at the response that\'s been mobilized by the Obama administration in terms of the resources provided by FEMA, the resources provided in the budget that have been expedited to give the city of Flint and the state of Michigan more resources to deal with this\xc2\xa0situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There has been a federal official who is an expert in public health put in charge of coordinating the federal resources that are being offered to that situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So our response has been quite serious and I think consistent with the need there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still consistent with the need there, because there\xe2\x80\x99s still a huge gap -- even when we talk about the emergency declaration versus the disaster declaration.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the legalities of why that happened.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is still a\xc2\xa0huge gap between what people are saying is needed there -- $1 billion to replace infrastructure, to the $28 million that the Governor signed off on today, to the $5 million or so in the emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the $80 million that the President announced that he was going to expedite at the end of last week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re not even close to what people seem to be saying or definitely saying that they think is needed to address this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me say two things about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first is, I do think it is still unclear exactly what is needed to remedy the problems in Flint, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that state, local, and even federal officials are still studying.\xc2\xa0And I think that what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is consistent with that observation, which is we do believe that Congress should pass legislation that would give the state of Michigan and the city of Flint additional resources to address the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the question is, what kind of policy should be attached to that bill, what exactly are the numbers that are needed in terms of resources, and that is work that\xe2\x80\x99s still being done to determine what exactly is needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, a question about the refugee crisis in Europe.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Germany, Finland, soon up to 80,000 in Sweden, they will be deporting tens of thousands of refugee that came in the last months, 45 percent of them not being\xc2\xa0serious candidates for refugee status.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you see any reason to review the American refugee system -- evaluation system, just considering the steps that are being taken in Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, the situation in the United States is different than the situation in Germany and other countries.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the reason for that primarily lies with the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re not so close to the situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not as easy\xc2\xa0for refugees from the Middle East to show up in the United States.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That means that we can impose a set of screening measures that take a close look at the individuals that are seeking to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And those who apply to enter the United States\xc2\xa0through the refugee program undergo the more strict screening than any other individual that attempts to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, the United States actually accepts more refugees through the U.N. process than all the other countries in the world combined.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think that\'s a pretty good indication that the United States can both prioritize our national\xc2\xa0security and our homeland security while, at the same time, showing the kind of generosity that is the hallmark of American values.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to second-guess the kinds of policies that are put in place by other countries because other countries\xc2\xa0are facing a different situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has certainly made clear that the screening process for individuals seeking to enter the United States will be structured in a way that makes the safety and security of our homeland and the American people the number-one\xc2\xa0priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A question on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A new commander over there, General Nicholson, wants everyone to be cautious when talking about the potential drawdown of troops.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, is the President satisfied with the mission over there at this\xc2\xa0very point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult situation in Afghanistan right now.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\'s a dangerous country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the Afghan government and the Afghan national security forces have been in charge\xc2\xa0of the security situation in that country for only about a year or so.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there are lessons that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to learn and some losses that they have sustained.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the United States military and our NATO partners have made substantial contributions to offering\xc2\xa0training and advice and assistance and expertise to those security forces.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also been a mission that U.S. military personnel have undertaken that is focused on counterterrorism that has both an element of protecting the forces that are serving in Afghanistan,\xc2\xa0but also protecting the United States and our interests from extremist organizations that are operating in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is certainly pleased with the performance of the U.S. military and our NATO partners in this effort.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\'ve actually seen from the Afghans a willingness to fight for their country, a willingness to respond to losses\xc2\xa0and to recover from them and fight back.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe talked about the situation in Kunduz last fall; this was a city that was taken over by the Taliban.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what you saw was the Afghan national security forces withdrew, reorganized, and then retook the city.\xc2\xa0Obviously you would prefer to be in a situation where they repelled the initial Taliban advance in the first place, but their ability to be resilient and to continue to have the passion to fight for their country will be critical to their long-term success\xc2\xa0in securing their country against extremist elements that operate there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What do you expect -- I know the administration was expecting there would be a greater involvement of NATO partners.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President is pleased with what\xe2\x80\x99s being done, but more was expected and not much is coming\xc2\xa0-- am I right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think what you\'re right about is that we\'re going to continue to have intensive conversations with our NATO partners about how they can contribute to the ongoing efforts inside of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And\xc2\xa0over the last --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You want more from them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You want more from them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I would say that over the last 15 years we\'ve seen countries in NATO make substantial contributions to the situation in Afghanistan, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to sustain those kinds of contributions\xc2\xa0moving forward.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I\'m confident that that will be an important part of the discussions over the course of this year leading up to the NATO Summit that\xe2\x80\x99s planned for later this summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Josh, a quick follow-up on your answer to the question about the Iranian fly-by, the drone fly-by, and pointing that to the Pentagon or to the Navy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is it correct to understand that that fly-by didn\xe2\x80\x99t cause\xc2\xa0concern in this building, the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, we obviously would want to get a good sense from the Department of Defense how concerned they were about the situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously those who are on the frontlines here can best assess what sort\xc2\xa0of threat this posed to our men and women in uniform and what impact this had on their ability to conduct their mission and their regular operations in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for an assessment of that, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If they tell you that they were not unnecessarily constrained by this activity, then yes, I think it would be fair for you to assume that\xc2\xa0the White House wasn\xe2\x80\x99t concerned about it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But you should check with the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in other drone news, I wanted to ask you about a report in The Intercept you probably saw about the U.S. allegedly hacking into Israeli drones to get a sort of bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye view of what they were looking\xc2\xa0at.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re said they\xe2\x80\x99re reporting based on files provided by Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you have a response to that?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And anything you can say to us in regard to the status of Mr. Snowden?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Give us information?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I don\'t have any update on Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s status.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He is somebody who continues to face serious charges here in the United States, and we believe that he should face those charges.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If he does, he will\xc2\xa0obviously be given all of the rights and access to due process that other American citizens enjoy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99s facing serious charges and that\'s his status.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the news reports, I have some language that probably will sound familiar to you, and this is the language that we used in response to other reports that were based on Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s activities, and\xc2\xa0that simply is that I\'m not in a position to comment on any specific alleged intelligence activities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a general matter, and as we have said many times previously, we do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific\xc2\xa0and validated national security purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore generally, our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is sacrosanct.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And those aren\'t just words and rhetoric that you hear from government officials.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is actually backed up by specific commitments and actions\xc2\xa0by the United States of America.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And this President has certainly lived up to those commitments in a way that caused Prime Minister Netanyahu to remark that the cooperation between our two countries on security matters is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the President\xc2\xa0is committed to continuing that cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI noted yesterday that there are these ongoing discussions about deepening and even expanding our security cooperation with Israel.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can tell you that those meetings that were planned between senior national security\xc2\xa0officials in the United States and Israeli counterparts was, like many other things, affected by the bad weather over the weekend.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I can tell you that those officials will leave and travel to Israel early next week to begin those discussions -- or to\xc2\xa0continue those discussions, which have been ongoing since President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu met here at the White House at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unwavering except for the weather delay.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exactly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Okay.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can you tell us who\xe2\x80\x99s going?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No, but I can look into that for you and get you some more details on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One other question to follow up on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email release from the State Department.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In terms of the delay, there have been some allegations that there\xe2\x80\x99s something specific to this last cache of emails\xc2\xa0in terms of perhaps the clearance level security -- classification level of the content of these emails.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can you respond to that and the allegation that because of that particular element and that particular aspect, that the delay towards the time on the\xc2\xa0calendar that is after early state voting, that there are allegations that this is politically motivated?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can you respond to that idea that the administration has somehow tried to tip the scales on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can tell you with full confidence that there has been no political interference in this process.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I don\'t have a lot of knowledge, granular knowledge about the content of the materials that are being\xc2\xa0prepared for release.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can tell you that their work has been important because there are guidelines that are laid out in the Freedom of Information Act that require a lot of coordination with other agencies that may have equities in the release of those\xc2\xa0materials.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think what you can infer from the delay are two things.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One is that the volume of materials was large.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And, second, that they\xe2\x80\x99re being quite conscientious about the need to coordinate with other agencies\xc2\xa0that may have a stake in the release of these materials to ensure that the materials are properly handled and properly released.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Staying with emails for just a moment, can you say with certainty and confidence that Secretary Clinton will not be indicted because of this email scandal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That will be a decision that is made by the Department of Justice and prosecutors over there.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What I know that some officials over there have said is that she is not a target of the investigation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that does not seem\xc2\xa0to be the direction that it\xe2\x80\x99s trending, but I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to weigh in on a decision or in that process in any way.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, again, based on what we know from the Department of Justice,\xc2\xa0it does not seem to be headed in that direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a Democrat, should there be a plan B just in case?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, if Secretary Clinton were to get the nomination or be leading significantly after Super Tuesday or deeper into the process, should there not be a plan B for\xc2\xa0Democrats in the event that she is indicted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not something I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Okay.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s been described as -- the fourth quarter we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- by some as sluggish, anemic, very little growth.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Are you surprised?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And is this -- low expectation performance by the economy, especially\xc2\xa0when you add it to the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve just learned from the White House that the deficit will likely rise in 2016 as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kevin, the numbers that we saw from the Department of Commerce today were actually right on expectations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And they are an indication that the United States continues to have the strongest, most durable economy in the\xc2\xa0world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, our economy is the envy of the world, particularly when you consider what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in other economies with whom we have -- do a lot of a business.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So this is a day of celebration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I think this is a day in which we acknowledge that the United States is in a much better position than basically any other country in the world, particularly when it comes to advanced economies.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And, in fact, one\xc2\xa0thing that is restraining even stronger -- an even stronger performance by our economy is the fact that these other economies around the world are showing some weakness right now; that what we\xe2\x80\x99re encountering right now primarily are headwinds from overseas.\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest challenge to our economy right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is, there are several things that we can do about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first is, we can take care of more of our business here at home.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can make deeper investments in infrastructure that we know create jobs in the short term\xc2\xa0but actually lay a long-term foundation for economic strength.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can do more to look out for the hardest-working Americans by raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we can also do more to strengthen our relationships with those economies that are the most dynamic.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has advocated the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a trade\xc2\xa0agreement that, if we can get it done this year, would have a positive impact on economic growth, would have a positive economic impact on job creation, and would position the United States even better to weather some of the international headwinds that we\xe2\x80\x99re\xc2\xa0experiencing right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Okay, last one.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the strategy as it relates to ISIS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We talked earlier -- or you did -- about Secretary Carter\xe2\x80\x99s interview on NPR, where he suggested that all the proposals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve given the President\xc2\xa0he has readily accepted.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And yet, the New York Times in its reporting said that the President resented efforts to pressure him to have more troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is that true?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Or did they get that wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I have learned long ago that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand up here and critique others\xe2\x80\x99 reporting.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I will note that my eyebrow is raised in the same way that yours apparently did when you read that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you is the President is quite pleased with the kind of advice that he gets from his national security team.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He relies heavily on the expertise of our men and women in uniform at the Department of Defense for suggestions\xc2\xa0and recommendations about the best way to intensify those elements of our counter-ISIL strategy that are showing some progress.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I assure you that, if anything, it is the leaders at the Department of Defense who are feeling pressure from the Commander-in-Chief\xc2\xa0to find new ideas and new ways to further intensify those elements of our strategy that are working.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I wanted to get your take on the Iowa caucus coming up tonight.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last opportunity to ask you about this before I head out to the Hawkeye state.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dress warm.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I will indeed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Snowstorm on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You have some experience here helping the President, then Senator Obama, win the Iowa caucus back in 2008.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I wanted to get your sense about how important it is for Democrats to win Iowa.\xc2\xa0Does it give you that momentum?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the President, then Senator Obama, had not won Iowa, would it have, in your opinion, hurt him in the process to winning the Democratic nomination?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Give me your take as someone who\xe2\x80\x99s experienced this before.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, look, each race is different, and the dynamics of the race and the calendar are different every year.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think in some ways that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the primary process and even the Iowa caucus process so interesting.</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s true, in 2008, if Barack Obama had not won the Iowa caucuses, that he probably would not have won the nomination and therefore would not have become President.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time, in 2008, there was a lot of skepticism\xc2\xa0about a couple of different things.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst is, then-Senator Obama demonstrated an ability to draw large crowds in ways that Democratic candidates had traditionally not been able to draw.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And he even had been able to inspire a lot of young people, a lot of people who\xc2\xa0had not previously been engaged in the political process, to be interested in his campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so there\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamental question about whether or not he was going to be able to take that interest and that passion at a rally and turn it into a high-functioning political organization that\xe2\x80\x99s required to turn out and win a caucus\xc2\xa0campaign.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the skepticism about his ability to do that I think was entirely understandable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was a credible thing and a proposition that could only be tested on caucus night.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it clearly passed the test with flying colors.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was also some skepticism about whether or not an African American senator who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much experience in Washington, D.C. -- he looked pretty young; certainly a lot younger than he looks now -- about whether or not he would\xc2\xa0be able to sort of pass the Commander-in-Chief test.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there were a lot of people that said, well, you know, Democratic activists and people who follow the political process will be interested in hearing him speak, but it will be a different thing when\xc2\xa0they actually have to consider whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll support him to be Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third question was, frankly, about race.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Iowa, it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret, even in the Democratic caucus process, is overwhelmingly white.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there were questions about whether or not an African American candidate could earn so much support\xc2\xa0from white voters.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And again, he passed that test with flying colors.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Iowa caucus in 2008 was so significant to the prospects for then-Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dynamics of this face are obviously a whole lot different, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to you guys to analyze\xc2\xa0sort of the stakes in this contest for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders and Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they all have their own take on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s notable is it\xe2\x80\x99s the first contest of the presidential cycle.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the other reason that it\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that all of our own personal assumptions and hypotheses about\xc2\xa0the candidates and their strategy can be put to the test.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what will make Monday night a pretty interesting night of television.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you think that -- I realize -- I agree with you, dynamics are always different in each election cycle.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you think Iowa will give momentum to whoever wins on Monday?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Momentum to either Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, as important as Iowa was in 2008 for then-Senator Obama, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t give us very much momentum in New Hampshire, as many of us rather vividly recall.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously, then-former Senator Clinton did quite well in the\xc2\xa0New Hampshire primary against Senator Obama.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think the dynamics of each of these contests are a little different, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to assess whether or not the candidate that wins this time will get the same kind of -- or will get a boost, unlike President Obama did in\xc2\xa02008.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Syrian opposition High Negotiations Committee is boycotting the peace talks starting today in Syria, so there\xe2\x80\x99s really nobody to negotiate with.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So haven\xe2\x80\x99t the talks sort of failed before they\xe2\x80\x99ve even started?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, Victoria, this has been a long-running process, and there have been a number of diplomatic engagements that have brought us to this point.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the U.N. right now is engaging with representatives\xc2\xa0of the Syrian government as a part of this ongoing process.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor updates about the participation of the high negotiating council, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re sort of tracking this most closely.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, obviously, the resolution of the political situation in Syria is critical to our efforts to address the chaos in that country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the political failures inside of Syria have led to terrible consequences both in terms of the\xc2\xa0humanitarian toll that this situation has taken, but also on the broader instability not just in the Middle East but around the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot riding on this diplomatic process, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States is so invested in it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that\xe2\x80\x99s also why I\xe2\x80\x99d caution against sort of a snap judgment about success or failure.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s only over the long term where we will be able to determine if these talks will eventually prove to be fruitful.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is the United States willing to do to try to get them to the table at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear interest that the opposition groups have in trying to negotiate the long-overdue political transition inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They feel that the U.S. is putting undue pressure on them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, I think the international community is putting a lot of pressure on them to be constructive and to constructively engage in a process that will bring about the kind of political transition that is badly needed inside\xc2\xa0of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tConnie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thank you.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A follow-up on the Middle East.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s Holocaust speech was very, very powerful.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Have you had much reaction from the Arab governments about the speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific reaction that we\xe2\x80\x99ve received from them, but we can check on that and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything notable to share with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that the President did feel strongly about having the opportunity to deliver those remarks both to demonstrate -- well, I think primarily to sort of demonstrate how the actions that were taken by those brave Americans\xc2\xa0to save Jews who were fleeing the Holocaust represents the best of America.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It represents American values saving innocent lives.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that is worthy of celebrating all these many years later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And on the MOU, do you know if American aid levels to Israel and to Egypt will remain at the present level?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s very high.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this point, right now, what is being discussed is the kind of security and military assistance that the United States provides to Israel.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point about what those levels will be, because\xc2\xa0that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But once we have an agreement, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more detail to share about the kind of assistance the United States is providing our close ally in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tSusan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Back to the Syria question.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can you unequivocally say that John Kerry did not threaten the Syrian opposition leaders with defunding or failing to back their efforts anymore if they did not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to the State Department about the conversations that they\xe2\x80\x99re having with the agency.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re in the best position to try to describe that situation to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Surely, though, the EU would have checked in with the State Department by now, and the White House would have --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re in touch with them all the time about a range of issues, as Byron well knows.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize the kinds of conversations they\xe2\x80\x99re having.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, I think what I did acknowledge to Victoria\xc2\xa0is I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised if there are some representatives of the opposition who are saying they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling pressure from the international community to engage in diplomatic talks to try to resolve the political situation inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If they are, that\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0good, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe want to bring both sides together through this U.N.-led process and try to resolve the political situation inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen overnight.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen in the context of one set of talks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But\xc2\xa0we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to continue making progress in this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Secretary Kerry deserves a lot of credit for being so tireless and dogged in his attempt.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are lives that are on the line here, hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives that have been terribly affected by the chaos\xc2\xa0inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And look, it only continues to get worse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the opposition leaders have put a lot on the line, obviously, for that -- I mean, their own lives, the lives of their families.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously they have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about -- when you say the word \xe2\x80\x9cpressure,\xe2\x80\x9d are you talking about defunding the opposition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of the conversations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe strongly that both sides need to play a constructive role in these conversations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the United States who feel strongly about this,\xc2\xa0it is the broader international community who was quite focused on trying to resolve the political situation inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor all of our military might and all of our military effort, the situation inside of Syria will only be resolved when the political failures in that country have been resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can you address the Syrian opposition leaders\xe2\x80\x99 concern about your closeness, and Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s closeness specifically, with his Iranian counterpart and also his Russian counterpart?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They have said to me and others that they are very\xc2\xa0-- that they\xe2\x80\x99re worried that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be cut in a bad deal, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to accept Bashar Assad\xe2\x80\x99s reelection and not going to get any humanitarian protections out of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Look, I think there is a lot of evidence that would ease whatever concerns may have been expressed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through a few of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor years, and repeatedly, we have made clear that Bashar al-Assad must go, that he\xe2\x80\x99s lost the legitimacy to lead that country, again, not just because of the great moral offense that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to his willingness to slaughter innocent\xc2\xa0civilians, but also because, as a practical matter, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to inspire the confidence of the Syrian people if he continues to attack them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that Bashar al-Assad needs to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States I think has demonstrated quite a clear commitment to trying to meet the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people who are fleeing violence.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian\xc2\xa0assistance to Syrians who are fleeing violence, both within Syria but also in the broader region.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think you also heard -- Margaret and I had a conversation yesterday about the Russian role in all of this.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think I was pretty blunt in saying that\xc2\xa0the Russian military support for the Assad regime was having a negative impact on our ability to try to reach a political resolution to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any reluctance on the part of me, frankly, or anybody else publicly, to express our significant concerns about the way that Russia is handling their business when it comes to this situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Their\xc2\xa0military strategy directly contradicts their stated political strategy, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve held that up and made that clear, and told them in no uncertain terms that their military strategy needs to change.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My question was Bashar Assad\xe2\x80\x99s reelection -- are you saying right now that the deal would not include any provision for him to be reelected?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to draw any sort of -- look, the political situation inside of Syria has to be negotiated between the government and the opposition.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the U.N. negotiator in place that\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to facilitate\xc2\xa0those discussions, because what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about right now are just proximity negotiations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not even talking about sitting across the table from one another -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the U.N. doing some shuttle diplomacy here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear\xc2\xa0about what our position is, and the details are going to have to be worked out by the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not dictating outcomes here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need the Syrian people to engage in this.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me do the week ahead, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys get started on your weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, as I mentioned, the President will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss a range of legislative priorities for the upcoming year.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the President is certainly\xc2\xa0hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to build on the momentum of the bipartisan\xc2\xa0budget agreement that was reached at the end of last year and discuss areas of cooperation for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will be here at the White House hosting meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will deliver remarks at the national prayer breakfast.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is something that the President has done each year that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office, so I know he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to this year\xe2\x80\x99s event.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the afternoon, the President will welcome the 2015 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors to the White House.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be honoring the team for winning the NBA Finals last year.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This visit will continue\xc2\xa0the tradition begun by President Obama of honoring sports teams for their efforts to give back to their communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater that afternoon, still on Thursday, the President will welcome President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia to the White House for an official working visit.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The leaders will hold a bilateral meeting and mark\xc2\xa015 years of bipartisan cooperation through Plan Colombia, the joint effort to create a safer, more prosperous future for the people of Colombia.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on Friday, the President will be here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have one additional bonus announcement.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not this coming Monday, but the Monday after, February 8th, President Obama will host President Sergio Mattarella of Italy at the White House.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0President Mattarella will visit the United States\xc2\xa0from February 16th -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, from February 6th through the 13th.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Italy is a valued NATO ally and a close partner on a broad range of global challenges.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During their meeting, the two Presidents will discuss our shared efforts to counter ISIL and the global\xc2\xa0refugee crisis.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They will also exchange views on economic developments on Europe, the importance of concluding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and a variety of other areas of mutual interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo lots to look forward to in the next couple weeks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But until then, have a great weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02:04 P.M.
