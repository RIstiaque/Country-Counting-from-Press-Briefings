Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:32 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see that some of you made it back from Germany already.\xc2\xa0 Hope the rest of you missed us -- I\'m sure you did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any announcements at the top, Josh, so I\'ll let you get us started with questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President attracted a little bit of attention during his press conference yesterday for saying that he did not yet have a complete strategy.\xc2\xa0 And I know he was referring very specifically to a strategy for training Iraqi forces, not the broader fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But, nonetheless, Republicans have been piling on.\xc2\xa0 So I wanted to give you an opportunity to do a little bit of clean-up, if you would like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, I think the President was very direct about something that we have actually talked about in here for several weeks now, which is the President has been very clear with his team that we need to be carefully examining the strategy and refining and optimizing it where we can capitalize on lessons learned, apply some best practices, and make sure that we\'re doing everything we can to make progress against ISIL and make progress in the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy them.</p>\n<p>That is the ultimate goal.\xc2\xa0 The training, equipping, and offering some advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces is merely one element of that strategy.\xc2\xa0 But this is one area where we can talk with some specificity about how Iraqi security forces that have benefitted from the support of our coalition military partners have performed well on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And what we know is in at least one recent area where we experienced a setback, in Ramadi, those were forces that had not benefitted from being trained by the U.S.-led coalition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so, again, this is an example of the President saying, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that we\'re taking the lessons learned.\xc2\xa0 We know that troops in the Iraqi security forces that have the support of the coalition perform well on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s try to ramp up the numbers and capacity of those individuals in Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly the strategy that we\'re pursuing.</p>\n<p>Now, how exactly to implement that is something that we\'re still working through.\xc2\xa0 And what we also know that we need for us to maximize that opportunity is for the Iraqi government to do a better job of sending recruits to that program.\xc2\xa0 And that includes both Iraqi security force units -- essentially units of the Iraqi military -- to get enhanced training from our coalition trainers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It also means the Iraqi central government doing a better job of recruiting more Sunni tribal fighters, because ultimately we do know that the only sustainable solution are local security forces in Anbar Province that are willing to take on ISIL, that they can do so knowing that they have the full support of our military coalition, can be backed by military airstrikes, but also know that after they have succeeded in driving ISIL out of Anbar Province that they can then, working with the Iraqi central government, actually govern that region of the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Kirby over at the State Department this morning said that saving Iraq could be a proposition that takes three to five years.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- that obviously would put us well into the next White House.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put a number on it.\xc2\xa0 But the President has indicated exactly what Mr. Kirby indicated, which is that this is something that is going to require a significant and long-term commitment from the international community.\xc2\xa0 This is not a short-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 And we are in a phase now where we are very focused on degrading ISIL and their capacity to operate inside of Iraq, but that over the long term we\'re going to need to build up the capacity of the local governments and of the local security forces, and to enhance their capabilities when it comes to working with the central government and, frankly, build up their confidence in the central government -- not just to both function effectively, but also to look out for their interests.</p>\n<p>We have been blunt about our assessment that one of the things that created the kind of weakness that ISIL capitalized on last year was the failure of the Maliki-led central government in Baghdad to demonstrate to the diverse population of Iraq that he had their best interests at heart.\xc2\xa0 And that did cause that country to fracture, particular along sectarian lines, and did create an opening that ISIL has capitalized on.</p>\n<p>So what we want to do is we want to make sure that we can address this immediate threat from ISIL, allow Iraqi security forces and Iraqi fighters to take the fight on the ground to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But once they\xe2\x80\x99re driven out, we want to make sure that there is a local governing capacity there and that there is confidence in the Iraqi central government to lead that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that three-to-five-year timetable that the State Department put out, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that you are disputing, is it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that this is going to be -- this is not going to be a short-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent with Mr. Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s assessment as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was an interesting moment yesterday in Germany where Prime Minister Abadi appeared to sidle up to the President for an interaction, and some interpreted it as some type of a snub, or perhaps the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that the Prime Minister was there, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up speaking at that time.\xc2\xa0 Can you clear up for us what was going on at that interaction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think those who concluded that it was a snub were probably telegraphing some insecurities that date back to junior high.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the President just completed a long working lunch that included Prime Minister Abadi, and the President was engaged in conversations with the IMF Director and others.</p>\n<p>After that photograph, the President did have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Abadi in a bilateral, private meeting, and it actually represented the second time in two months that the two leaders had met.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the President has all the communication he needs with Prime Minister Abadi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to ask you about these protests that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Texas after a white police officer pulled a gun on a group of black teenagers who were at a party and tackled one girl to the ground.\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the video of that incident, and does he feel that race may have been a motivating factor in that incident?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has seen the video.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the news coverage of that particular incident.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear is that early indications are that local authorities have taken what appear to be appropriate steps.\xc2\xa0 They have placed that officer on leave.\xc2\xa0 And again, without knowing any of the details here, but that seems like a prudent thing for them to do.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, what steps they need to take and what the investigation yields about what exactly happened there is still something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a few more days at least to determine.</p>\n<p>But, again, I think this goes back to something that the President has been talking about quite a bit over the last several months, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong benefit to police forces working effectively to build the trust and confidence of the communities that they\xe2\x80\x99re sworn to serve and protect.\xc2\xa0 And I think understandably, graphic incidents like the one that we saw depicted on that video do have a detrimental impact on the relationship between local law enforcement and the local community.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s evident from some of the news coverage and public statements of people who live in that community.</p>\n<p>But, again, based on very early evidence here, it appears that local authorities understand the need to protect that trust and are trying to take steps consistent with that priority.\xc2\xa0 I will say that this is a topic that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Task Force on 21st Century Policing looked at carefully.\xc2\xa0 And they put forward a long list of public recommendations of best practices that local law enforcement agencies can implement to enhance the trust with local communities.\xc2\xa0 And so that obviously is something that we believe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just enhance the safety and security of the American public and of communities across the country, it actually makes it safer for members of local law enforcement to do their very important work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on that please, Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come right back to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about encryption.\xc2\xa0 And I know you talked about this a little bit last week, but since then, yesterday, two major industry groups -- technology industry groups sent a letter to the White House saying they oppose policy actions that would undermine encryption, and specifically said they oppose building in work-arounds for government law enforcement to get in through encrypted systems.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any reaction to what they said, and if you can explain sort of the process, where things are at in the White House consideration of this issue.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I have not seen the letter, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that was something that they sent today.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s still in the mail.\xc2\xa0 The thing that I -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a new position, frankly, to share with you at this point.\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain where things are at in the President\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of encryption and allowing law enforcement to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of that policy process.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken about this publicly on a couple of different occasions, both in the news conference that he convened with Prime Minister Cameron earlier this year as well as at the cybersecurity summit that the President convened out at Stanford University back in February. So his position on this is clear.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of that policy process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no recommendations before him that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at or considering?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a public update for you on the process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, on Turkey.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering whether the White House has any reaction to the election there, and any concerns about what it might mean for stability in the country or the fight against Islamic State, or if there are any implications for U.S. initiatives that are happening on the borders there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected parliament and with the future government, and to continuing our close political economic and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, Turkey is a NATO ally of the United States, and we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to continuing our close political, economic and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 One area where the United States is coordinating closely with Turkey in our efforts to try to shut down the flow of foreign fighters that benefits ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This is really important.\xc2\xa0 This is a difficult task.\xc2\xa0 Turkey has a long border with Syria and we know that that is a commonly used route for individuals who are looking to travel to Syria to enter the country and to take up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we know that Turkey has taken important steps to try to shut down the flow of those individuals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there is more that we would like them to do.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President was pretty direct in his conversations -- or in his comments at the news conference yesterday about what more we would like to see Turkey do to shut down the flow of foreign fighters in a way that would benefit the security of not just countries throughout the region but also benefit the security of the people of Turkey.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the outcome of the election have any bearing on that -- on what the United States hopes to see Turkey do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States -- again, they\xe2\x80\x99re a NATO Ally.\xc2\xa0 We have a strong relationship with them, particularly when it comes to matters related to national security.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we are pleased with the work that Turkey has done so far to address this issue.\xc2\xa0 But we also believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s more important work that they should be doing.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated those views directly to them in private and I think the President was pretty blunt in talking about it publicly as well.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s words yesterday on what was working and not working in the fight against ISIS, I think what really stands out is this lack of recruits in certain areas where the capacity to train is there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, at this point, Iraq is trying to defend its own country.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are people of Iraq whose cities are being overrun.\xc2\xa0 The fact that those recruits aren\xe2\x80\x99t there now, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that bode poorly for the future of this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in so many ways, the U.S. is picking up every slack.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I think you are making an observation that we have discussed for some time about politics being critically important to the longer-term success of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that is to say the Iraqi central government needs to inspire the confidence of the people of Iraq; that they need to build political support for their ongoing efforts to lead that country and to unify that country to face down the ISIL threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is, as I mentioned in response to one of Josh\xe2\x80\x99s questions, this is what we had diagnosed as the principal weakness of the previous prime minister -- that Prime Minister Malaki had governed that country in a way that did not demonstrate a commitment to inclusiveness and, frankly, made that country vulnerable to the kind of offensive operations from ISIL that we saw last summer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we are pleased that Prime Minister Abadi has followed through on his early political commitments to try to govern that country in a multi-sectarian fashion, and to demonstrate clearly to every citizen of Iraq that he has their best interest at heart and that the country\xe2\x80\x99s resources will be used to benefit every citizen in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult challenge.\xc2\xa0 You can understand the skepticism among some members of the Shia population who, for a long time, did not feel that the Iraqi central government had their best interests at heart.\xc2\xa0 And you can imagine that they\xe2\x80\x99re carefully evaluating the policy decisions that are being made by the new Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 And I think their hesitation is understandable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s also clear, though, is that the failure of the Iraqi people to unite behind this goal of facing down the ISIL threat put at risk the very existence of their country.\xc2\xa0 And so the stakes here are high.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, again, our approach to this challenge has always been to insist that Prime Minister Abadi follow through on his commitments to build a multi-sectarian security force to govern the country in an inclusive way.\xc2\xa0 And so far he\xe2\x80\x99s done that, to his credit, but it will take some time for him to build and strengthen the trust of the population -- the population that\xe2\x80\x99s not Shia, like he is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like now is the time to defend their own country from falling apart completely.\xc2\xa0 Building this inclusive government network is going to take a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 This seems to be pointing directly to a lack of a will to fight overall.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was going to say, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an overly broad generalization.\xc2\xa0 That there have been areas --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Areas, yeah.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, there have been areas where we have seen the Iraqi security forces, when backed with the support of our military coalition, not just demonstrate a will to fight but actually demonstrate some effectiveness when fighting.\xc2\xa0 And that has succeeded in driving ISIL out of areas like Tikrit and Haditha, even some areas in Anbar like Baghdadi.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication that there is a strategy -- there is a template for success here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we want to make sure that we essentially work closely with the Iraqi central government to build on that opportunity, and that means a variety of things.\xc2\xa0 It means putting more Iraqi security forces through our training programs, but it also means recruiting more Sunni local tribal fighters who will benefit from the advice and assistance in training of coalition forces.\xc2\xa0 And that last element is particularly important because, as you point out, these local Sunni tribal fighters will take the fight to ISIL not just within their own country but in their own neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 And it means that these Sunni tribal fighters will be fighting for their communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that they carry out those efforts under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 And again, it reflects Prime Minister Abadi\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to governing the country in a multi-sectarian way, and protecting the country in a multi-sectarian way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, what do you think about this bipartisan AUMF that\xe2\x80\x99s being introduced in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Michelle, several months ago the administration put forward language urging Congress to pass an ISIL-specific authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 We put forward that language at the specific request of Congress so that they could follow through on something the President challenged them to do, which is to pass a specific authorization to use military force that applied in this case.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the administration send up the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to go and urge -- to testify before congressional committees and urge Congress to take action. And in the last several months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen very little congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some pretty sharp criticism from me because of their failure to act on this.</p>\n<p>But I do think that the language that was put forward by Senator Kaine and Senator Flake is an indication that at least some members of Congress are willing to step up and fulfill their constitutional responsibility to be heard on this matter.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Senator Kaine and Senator Flake deserve credit for that.\xc2\xa0 The language that they put forward does include some tweaks to the language that we had originally submitted.\xc2\xa0 But we are also candid about the fact from day one that our legislative language was intended to be a starting point for negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it appears that Senator Kaine and Senator Flake have acted consistent with the spirit of that legislative proposal.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that other members of Congress will follow through in a similar way.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the OPM hack.\xc2\xa0 We learned that up to 4 million current and former government employees had -- their personal information was vulnerable to these hackers.\xc2\xa0 Does that universe of people include Cabinet Secretaries?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, there is an ongoing investigation to this specific matter and that investigation includes the scope of this particular intrusion.\xc2\xa0 So if there\xe2\x80\x99s more information that we have to share about who precisely was affected, that\xe2\x80\x99s information that would come from the FBI who is leading this investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were the vulnerable personnel files -- did they include the Secret Service, FBI?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, part of this investigation is to determine the precise scope of the intrusion and to get a better sense of exactly what information was put at risk and what information was potentially exfiltrated.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s work that is ongoing right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we were told this was a universe of up to 4 million, so you must have known what the universe is.\xc2\xa0 Does that universe of possible vulnerabilities include Cabinet Secretaries, people employed by the Secret Service, FBI and the like?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, the scope of this particular intrusion is something that continues to be investigated by the FBI.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what did you mean when we were told it was 4 million -- up to 4 million?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that was a number that was based on our assessment at that time of precisely the number of records that were affected by this particular intrusion.\xc2\xa0 But this is an ongoing investigation and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You must information as to -- I mean, that number didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of the blue.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was 4 million who, 4 million what?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve described them as either former or current federal employees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any suggestion that this information that was taken, or feared to have been taken, could be used to either blackmail individuals or to steal the identity of individuals that have sensitive security positions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, again, the investigation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just include the scope of this particular intrusion, but it also includes an effort to try to determine the motive of the individuals who may have been acting in this case.\xc2\xa0 As a precautionary measure, those individuals that are determined to be at risk here will be offered by the Office of Personnel Management some identity theft protection and other advice about steps they can take --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So then you\xe2\x80\x99re offering that to somebody.\xc2\xa0 So is that being offered to Cabinet Secretaries, members of the Secret Service or FBI?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s being offered to individuals who may have potentially been affected in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so does those individuals include --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to talk about the individuals who may have been affected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out that the group of people that I just mentioned were included in this group?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You should check with the FBI, and if they have more information to share with you they\xe2\x80\x99ll share it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you about this?\xc2\xa0 And what is the nature of the concern?\xc2\xa0 Is the concern that people might be ripped off because their identities might be stolen?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a greater concern -- security concern?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the concern that the President has is that this highlights the clear vulnerabilities that exist in many elements of the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s computer architecture.\xc2\xa0 And this administration, for years now, has been working diligently to try to upgrade our defenses and to put in place measures that would mitigate against those intrusions and respond to them when necessary.\xc2\xa0 This is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the President upset of the gross failure here?\xc2\xa0 I mean, supposedly, these people had access to personnel records for months without even being detected.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 the President is concerned about the vulnerabilities that were highlighted here.\xc2\xa0 But the other thing the President indicated, in talking about this yesterday, is that the reason that this intrusion was detected is that OPM was actually in the process of implementing better defenses of their computer network when this particular intrusion was detected.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly more important work that needs to be done not just at OPM, but at other government agencies.</p>\n<p>But, again, this is not different than the kind of threat that we see in the private sector as well.\xc2\xa0 And all of you represent news organizations, many of which have been subjected to intrusions like this, and your security professionals are doing the same thing that our security professionals are doing, which is making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re rapidly adapting to the innovative and persistent adversary that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was China behind this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The specific individuals or entities who carried out this particular intrusion is something that\xe2\x80\x99s still being investigated by the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have reason to believe it was a foreign government or somebody working on behalf of a foreign government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the FBI is doing is trying to determine who those individuals are and if they were acting on behalf of a criminal enterprise or a nation state.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to do their best to work to determine that.</p>\n<p>As is consistent with the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve used in investigating previous cyber intrusions, I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise you that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position at any point in the future to make a grand pronouncement about who may have been responsible for this particular intrusion, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we are working hard to try to determine.\xc2\xa0 And if a response is necessary, then the President, because of steps that he announced a couple of months ago, has more tools at his disposal to respond to this particular incident -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to the executive order the President signed that authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to impose financial sanctions against those who are deemed to be responsible or benefit from a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, with the al-Abadi meeting yesterday, which leader suggested -- who suggested to who that the United States should speed up or whatever, do more training of Iraqi forces?\xc2\xa0 Because the President, in the news conference, made a relatively strong statement saying that when Iraqi forces have been trained that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done much better at retrieving land of their country.\xc2\xa0 Who came up with the idea of speeding this process up, or however you want to put it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is a conclusion that the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team has reached based on their assessment of conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you have U.S. military personnel that are operating in joint operation centers in Iraq where they\xe2\x80\x99re essentially embedded with Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 You have some U.S. military personnel and coalition military personnel that are on the ground at -- stationed at bases in Iraq where they\xe2\x80\x99re working directly with Iraqi security forces to train them.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position, based on our knowledge of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground, to evaluate the effectiveness of Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 And what is becoming clear is that the kind of training that these Iraqi security forces are getting from the United States and our coalition partners is having a positive impact in their performance on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.</p>\n<p>And again, this is the President wanting to apply this lesson throughout the country, and to encourage the Iraqi central government to ramp up their recruitment both of other military personnel that are already enlisted in the Iraqi security forces, but also to include Sunni tribal fighters and others that will ensure that we have a multi-sectarian security force under the command and control of the Iraqi central government that\xe2\x80\x99s taking the fight to ISIL on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it a request from al-Abadi, or was it a suggestion by the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President and his national security team reached the conclusion that this was an effective strategy that the President wanted his team to ramp up.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to that question about Texas.\xc2\xa0 First of all, how did the President find out?\xc2\xa0 Was he watching the news, or was he informed by the Justice Department as to what was going on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any formal notification that the President has gotten from the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously something that was covered extensively in the news while we were in Germany.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he find out in Germany, or did he find out when he came back here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President was aware of this yesterday, soon after it was reported publicly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in Germany, or on the plane coming back?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In Germany.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So also -- well, now since, yet again, another videotape has surfaced showing at the very least the fact that there could be excessive force, is there an expectation at this White House that the Justice Department will go into this and look at what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would obviously be a decision that would be made by officials at the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 That would not be a presidential directive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand that, but is there an expectation, particularly when, again, this White House is now known for this effort into supporting law enforcement as well as rooting out the bad policing, is this something that there\xe2\x80\x99s an expectation possibly around this White House that this could indeed be something that the Justice Department could be reviewing to see what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of an investigation, that would be a decision that would be made by Department of Justice prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 And so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything that might leave somebody with the appearance that we\xe2\x80\x99re interfering in those kinds of decisions.\xc2\xa0 But there are also other officials at the Department of Justice that are responsible for administering federal resources that can be used to assist local law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 And some of those individuals have spent time in places like Ferguson, in Baltimore, and other places, other communities that have experiences this kind of public attention as a result of the conduct of some members of their local police force.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice for any decisions they may have about contacting the local law enforcement in that community in Texas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the waning months, year or so that you have in office, the President has in office, the President started out his presidency stepping into a situation with racial profiling and then at the end of the first term had Trayvon, and then it kept going second term with issues of policing.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration embrace the fact that because of how this President has handled the issue of policing, bad policing as well as supporting good policing, that this could be a legacy piece for him -- dealing with the accountability component of video cameras, also rooting out bad policing, pattern and practice reports, and changes in police departments?\xc2\xa0 Is this President looking at this as a legacy piece?\xc2\xa0 Are you embracing this as a potential legacy piece for this administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I guess what I would say is that this is an issue that the President has been involved in throughout his career in public service, going all the way back to his service in the Illinois State Senate; that some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s most important legislative achievements in that office were his efforts to broker agreement on racial profiling legislation in the state of Illinois.\xc2\xa0 And he did that by working closely with civil rights leaders, as well as law enforcement officials in that state.</p>\n<p>So this is an issue that the President has been working on for a long time and he spoke in pretty personal terms about why he believes these efforts are so important.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- I do think he expects that over the course of the next 18 months, that he will spend more time talking about this issue and continuing to make it a priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you do embrace it as a legacy piece?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\'s too early to say sort of what historians will evaluate.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons for that is that so much of what we have seen are -- that have raised concerns have raised questions about the leadership and staff of local law enforcement organizations, and the President has been pretty clear that as the head of the federal government he has limited influence over those particular organizations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the influence and authority that he has is influence and authority that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to use to do several things.\xc2\xa0 One is to help communities deal with these particular challenging situations, particularly in a way that supports, as you pointed out, the vast majority of men and women in law enforcement who work really hard and do a really good job of protecting communities all across the country, and doing it in a fair way.\xc2\xa0 These are professionals who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect.\xc2\xa0 And these are individuals who are worthy of our praise and our recognition.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that we can make those individuals more effective if we can bolster confidence that the community has in the broader law enforcement organization.</p>\n<p>And, again, I do think this is something the President will spend a decent amount of time talking about over the next year and a half.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just getting back to the breach of federal employee data.\xc2\xa0 I know you said, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve said at OPM that the reason they discovered it was because they were installing additional safeguards.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering whether the President thinks that there was a management failure here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is, after all, an agency that handles sensitive personal information for the vast majority of federal government employees.\xc2\xa0 They had been told by their IG that they had vulnerabilities.\xc2\xa0 Even though they were addressing those, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happening in a quick enough way, obviously, to stop this from happening.\xc2\xa0 So does he have confidence in the director over there and senior leadership that they have their hands around this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has confidence that every single member of his staff understands that cybersecurity needs to be a priority.\xc2\xa0 And, again, in talking about this yesterday, the President was pretty direct about the fact that we\'ve got our work cut out for us when it comes to taking what, in some cases, are pretty old computer systems and making sure that they have modern, adaptable security measures in place to protect against cyber intrusions.</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s also clear is that our adversaries -- whether we\'re talking about criminal enterprises or federal governments, or entities acting on behalf of foreign governments -- that these adversaries are persistent and well-resourced, and we need to make sure on our side that we\'re vigilant and well-resourced to meet this threat.\xc2\xa0 And it requires an approach that understands that this is a very adaptive environment, that particularly when we\'re talking about modern technology, we\'re talking about very complex mechanisms and the need to make sure that our defenses adapt as rapidly as our adversaries do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does he feel that the OPM Director is up to that challenge?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly believes that the Director of the OPM is aware that this is a priority.\xc2\xa0 And this is a message that\'s been delivered to -- the President convened this Cabinet meeting a couple of weeks ago -- two or three weeks ago, I guess it was now -- where this was an item on the agenda, the need to make sure that, institutionally, agencies across the administration understand that these kinds of threats are real and require the attention of the senior-level officials at each of these agencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>(Interruption of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Secret Service agents announce that they need to evacuate the Briefing Room.)</p>\n<p>(Pause at 2:08 P.M. EDT)</p>\n<p><br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 * * * *\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>(Briefing resumes at 2:46 P.M. EDT)</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll try this again.\xc2\xa0 Just to give you an update on what has transpired, as many of you may have heard from the Secret Service, shortly before 2:00 p.m. today, a telephonic bomb threat concerning the room that we are now all in was called into the Metropolitan Police Department.\xc2\xa0 The local police department contacted Secret Service officials, who determined that for the safety of all of us, they needed to evacuate the room and to sweep it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Fortunately, here at the White House, the Secret Service maintains the resources that are necessary to quickly make the room safe and make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe for all of us.\xc2\xa0 And they did that quickly, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to restart.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Before I get to your questions, I used our brief respite to gather some more information, Roberta, in terms of answering your previous question about encryption, and I can tell you that officials at the White House have received the letter.\xc2\xa0 We are aware of it, and we appreciate the input and perspective of these organizations.\xc2\xa0 The administration firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption.\xc2\xa0 The President himself has acknowledged that it can be a strong tool to secure commerce and trade, safeguard private information, and promote free expression and association.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re also, understandably, concerned about the use of encryption by terrorists and other criminals to conceal and enable crimes and other malicious activity.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that even though some people misuse this encryption technology.\xc2\xa0 We believe here in the administration that responsibly deployed encryption helps secure private communications in commerce, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s worth supporting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, before the alarm, who covered up the cameras in this room?\xc2\xa0 Because the cameras were covered up or pointed down. I mean, these are cameras that are owned by news organizations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering -- we were all escorted out, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody with our news organizations, but somebody cut off our ability to see what was going on in this room by turning the cameras down.\xc2\xa0 Who did that and why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was also evacuated alongside you, Jon, so I was not in the room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you find out?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because these cameras, again, are owned by the news organizations --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and somebody has gone to every single one of them, even the ones outside were tampered with so that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to see what was going on in here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was President Obama or his family in any way impacted or evacuated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They were not.\xc2\xa0 This was the only room in the White House complex that was evacuated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you were evacuated as well, though, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exclusively this room.\xc2\xa0 Who beyond this room or how far outside of this room did the evacuation go into effect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Peter, when I said that I was evacuated, I left the room at the same time that all of you did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you stayed in the White House complex, though?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was safe to be in the room adjacent to here, but specifically not in here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the room adjacent to here, Peter.\xc2\xa0 I went back into my office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do this one at a time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, so this room was evacuated.\xc2\xa0 Was the lower press room adjacent to us evacuated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, yes.\xc2\xa0 It is considered part of the press area that the White House press operates, so the staff that works there came into my office while the room was swept.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was any staff outside of this room or the adjacent room evacuated?\xc2\xa0 Was any senior staff or any other staff within the White House evacuated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it is my understanding that no one else was affected by this particular incident.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Concerning the evacuation --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do this one at a time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The call came in at 1:53 p.m., Josh, according to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 The evacuation took place, as you witnessed with us, at 2:14 p.m., so more than 20 minutes passed in that time.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason for any concern in that delay before the evacuation took place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 This is a decision that was made by Secret Service based on information that they had received.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long it took for that information to be transferred -- transmitted to the Secret Service and for the decision to be made to evacuate the room, but, again, the evacuation was conducted to protect the safety of all of us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what was the President doing at the time?\xc2\xa0 Even if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impacted, what was he physically doing while we were evacuating?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what he was doing.\xc2\xa0 He was here at the White House, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where he was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he was at the Oval Office at the time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where he was.\xc2\xa0 He was here on the White House grounds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this was a serious enough threat -- it was a bomb threat, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s serious enough to move us all the way over to the Executive Office Building, why would the President not be moved out of the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Chip, I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- these are obviously decisions that are made by the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 They did that in the interest of keeping us safe.\xc2\xa0 But I suspect that part of the reason for moving you to the South Court Auditorium was because that was a place where you could be inside and be in the air-conditioning.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do, is make sure that they could quickly clear the room, which they did, and allow us to all come back here and go about our business.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was never in any danger as far as we know?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Certainly not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do we know if there\xe2\x80\x99s any indication that this incident was connected to the security incident that we saw on Capitol Hill today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 You should check with the Secret Service about that.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, you said you were evacuated, but you mean you just went to your office?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 I was evacuated from this room, like all of you were.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you remind us how close your office is?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s right down the hallway.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not far away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just hard to imagine why a bomb threat that would necessitate evacuating this entire room wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the rest of this West Wing complex.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a very large complex.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a very large complex, but, Jon, I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for that.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly, can you tell us how it is that the rest of the West Wing could have stayed in their offices while we had to leave?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if it had been a bomb, is there some sort of fireproofing, bombproofing that exists between here and there that would allow them to stay while we had to leave?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all of the security measures that are in place to protect the White House.\xc2\xa0 Even if I did, I\'m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d be in a position to talk about them from here.\xc2\xa0 But for a question like that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what they did in here before they gave us the all-clear and let us come back?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that they swept the room, which, typically, involves the inspection of the room by some experts.\xc2\xa0 And I know that they had K9 units in here as well.\xc2\xa0 But for all of the activities that were required to clear the room, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Swept it very closely.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do this one at a time.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the question I was asking before we were evacuated.\xc2\xa0 If anyone else --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could we just say -- could you find out where the President was and where he was moved?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that he was not moved.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get some additional information about where he happened to be at that time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow on the line of questioning about the proximity.\xc2\xa0 So you were told to shelter in place, correct -- in your office?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, April, I was asked to leave the room in the same way that you did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying, in your office, were you told to shelter in place?\xc2\xa0 Because you said --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I was not told to shelter in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so we\xe2\x80\x99re just feet from your office and feet from the Oval Office, and also feet from the Residence.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a close proximity.\xc2\xa0 Was anyone else told in the Residence maybe to move, or over here, to shelter in place while this was going on? Because it seems like it was a very serious scenario that they had gone in offices, gone under desks, had dogs walking through, and that no one was told to move or shelter in place except for lower press.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I\'m sharing with you all the information that I have right now, which is that, based on a threat that the Secret Service received from another law enforcement organization about the press area at the White House, the press area at the White House was evacuated for the safety of all of us.\xc2\xa0 And the Secret Service, using resources that they keep here on the complex, was able to quickly search this location and conclude that it was safe.\xc2\xa0 As soon as they did we were able to all come back in the room and pick up where we left off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they moved us.\xc2\xa0 We went outside.\xc2\xa0 You say it was to keep us cool, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was.\xc2\xa0 We were out there -- you were in your office.\xc2\xa0 We went to Pebble Beach first, and then they moved us further down into the next building on the campus and moved us even further back.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for coolness.\xc2\xa0 It was because of a fear.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, with a proximity to everyone and everything here, the seat of power just feet away, and they were not moved, but we had to be pushed all the way back.\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying -- there\xe2\x80\x99s something not jogging and not mixing.\xc2\xa0 It just seems odd.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, for the questions that you have about decisions that were made by the Secret Service, then I would encourage you to contact the Secret Service and they can maybe get you a more specific answer to your question than I\'m able to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Secret Service to break into a briefing, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t -- they had to think about it coming in -- because I watched them.\xc2\xa0 They had to think about stopping the briefing because of the severity, and no one was -- it\'s just, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you talk to the President since the evacuation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I did not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just clarify?\xc2\xa0 Was he in the West Wing, do you know?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you precise information.\xc2\xa0 He was here at the White House, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what room he was in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are we ready to go back to our regularly scheduled programming?</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Viquiera.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say any more about the nature of the threat as it relates to law enforcement that would necessitate a limited evacuation here at the White House -- potency, or power, or wherever it may have been?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what information was transmitted in the specific bomb threat other than the briefing room was identified as the location of this purported bomb.\xc2\xa0 But I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was a bomb, though?\xc2\xa0 Not any sort of agent or --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, the Secret Service said it was a threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it concern you that if the bomb was in the building, that you were so close to it, potentially?\xc2\xa0 And does it concern you that if the bomb was called in as a threat that somebody in the press corps might have had on their person that the entire press corps was then kept together in a small area well away from the White House?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do either of these scenarios raise questions in your mind?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I have complete confidence in the professionalism of the men and women in the Secret Service to make judgments about what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to keep all of us safe, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they did this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 But for questions about why those decisions were made and how they were made, you can direct them to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Are we ready to move on to other topics?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said the President was not moved today.\xc2\xa0 Have there been occasions in the past during his presidency when he\xe2\x80\x99s been moved into the EEOB?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service for answering questions --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yourself, though?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Off the top of my head, no.\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Secret Service to confirm.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there was no bomb, right?\xc2\xa0 Just a threat.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t discover something and deactivate it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there was nothing --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, were any other members of the Obama family at the White House at the time that this all took place?\xc2\xa0 The girls, or his -- Michelle, First Lady Michelle Obama --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer to that, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that for you, too.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Okay, Julie, back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on what you were saying when we were all evacuated.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about a Cabinet meeting where the President raised this several weeks ago -- or a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to clarify, was that before or after he had been made aware, and you at the White House became aware of this breach of 4 million people\xe2\x80\x99s identifying information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of the precise sequence of those events.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you that it is not unusual for the President to spend time at a Cabinet meeting talking to the leaders of his government about the importance of cybersecurity. But I do know that as recently as the most recent Cabinet meeting which occurred two or three weeks ago, that this was an agenda item and the President made clear to members of his Cabinet how seriously he takes cybersecurity and how important it is for the leaders of those organizations to prioritize the effort to upgrade our cyber defenses, put in place software that can mitigate the threat from cyber intrusions, and also make sure that we have the tools that are necessary to adapt to the ever-evolving threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has he talked with the OPM Director since this breach was revealed, as he became aware of it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Juliette.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few major decisions or events coming up between the health care ruling that\'s expected to come out of the Supreme Court, the upcoming trade vote, and then obviously the deadline for the Iran talks.\xc2\xa0 When the President and his top aides look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the next few weeks, how do they view these key issues as influencing his ultimate record while here in office?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a busy summer.\xc2\xa0 It is an indication of just how dominate the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities have become in the political discussion in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that you have a President here who is doing everything that he can to drive his agenda.\xc2\xa0 And at least one or two of the topics that you cited are pretty good examples where members of Congress, failing to thwart the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda through the legislative process, have turned their attention to the courts.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication, again, of how much progress the President has made to advance his agenda, to advance his priorities.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to continue to implement them.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to -- the President spoke at length about the upcoming -- or the recent arguments before the Supreme Court related to the Affordable Care Act, and the President expressed some confidence that the administration would be able to continue to move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in a way that maximizes benefits for millions of Americans, not just the 16 million Americans who got health care coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, but because of the many other millions of Americans that benefit from the other consumer protections that are written into the law.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the ongoing Iran negotiations, the President does believe that negotiations with Iran are the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen a pretty concerted effort by some in Congress to try to undermine those negotiations, but the President remains as determined as ever to try to see that diplomatic effort through because he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of the United States; he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel; but also because it is clearly the best way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>And then the third one you mentioned was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Supreme Court ruling on health care.\xc2\xa0 So, right, I mean -- and trade, in terms of the trade --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, and then trade, yes.\xc2\xa0 And the President I think expressed some confidence that we would succeed in building a bipartisan majority in the House for trade promotion authority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should those events not transpire the way you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out, but, in fact, for example, the trade bill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass, the Supreme Court rules against you, or Iran falls through, how much do you think that affects the ultimate impact the President will have while in office?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way that we think about it is that these are priorities that the President has identified.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve already expended significant political capital on each of those things to try to move them forward, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made really important progress in each of those areas.\xc2\xa0 And the President is determined to see them through because they are consistent with the kinds of values and priorities that he promised the American people that he would seek to advance as President and this is him making good on that promise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on Iraq.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Number one, when the President says that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough recruits for training, what is he referring to -- number one, that overall, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough recruits that the Iraqi security forces are getting, or are not enough recruits being made available for training?\xc2\xa0 In other words, they\xe2\x80\x99re just not presenting enough of them for training?\xc2\xa0 Or is he simply saying there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough Sunni recruits and sort of non-Shia majority of recruits?\xc2\xa0 What is he exactly referring to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I think great minds think alike, because I asked our national security staff this exact question today.\xc2\xa0 So let me convey to you what I understand to be the case.\xc2\xa0 And in some ways, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to actually leave the most important thing for last, so stick with me here through the beginning.</p>\n<p>The first is we have seen that already-organized units of the Iraqi security forces are able to go through training -- so these are individuals who are already in the military, are already part of a unit, but when this unit has the benefit of coalition training, we see that they perform more effectively on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so one of the things that we would like to see the Iraqi government do is to speed the movement of Iraqi security force units into and through the coalition training process.\xc2\xa0 Now, what that means is it means when you are taking security forces from one area of the country and putting them into training, you need to make sure that you have enough recruits to replace them in what they\xe2\x80\x99re currently doing.\xc2\xa0 So there is a need for the Iraqi central government to continue to recruit Iraqis into the Iraqi security forces for that reason, to essentially replenish those security forces that are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re falling short of that?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would like to see them do more of that.\xc2\xa0 And our sense is, is that that would actually allow us to speed the process through which Iraqi units that are already organized be transferred into the training process.</p>\n<p>Now, separate from that, you asked what is a very good question about the effort to train local Sunni fighters.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s why that is really important -- and this goes back to a question that I was answering earlier.\xc2\xa0 The only enduring solution that we will have to this, what appears to be chaos in many areas in the Middle East, is for local structures to be in place where you have local governments and local security forces that are vested in the protection of their communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what is evident is that U.S. military personnel, even when fully committed to offensive large-scale ground operations, can be successful in stabilizing a security situation -- even over a large swath of desert in Iraq that essentially the United States military can effectively put a lid on outbreaks of violence.\xc2\xa0 But what we saw happen is, without a governing structure that has the credibility of the local population to follow on to those U.S. forces, we see that the fabric of those communities starts to break down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President has said as it relates to this specific strategy -- and this is true of our broader strategy against ISIL -- is we need to build up the capacity of local forces to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a phrase you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me use many times.\xc2\xa0 I would adapt it here to Anbar, which is, we need local forces on the ground who can take the fight to ISIL in their own communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so the idea is to essentially recruit local Sunni tribal righters, train them, equip them, have them work very closely with Iraqi security forces, have them all operate under the command and control of the Iraqi central government, and essentially have a multi-sectarian force fighting ISIL on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 What this means is it means you will have local citizens fighting ISIL to protect their own community, or in some cases, to take back their own communities.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that with the strong support of the Iraqi central government.</p>\n<p>So what this would do is it would inspire the confidence of local citizens in the support that they receive from the Iraqi central government, while at the same time, have individuals who have literally taken up arms to defend their own communities.</p>\n<p>And what I have just described is a scenario that we believe could ultimately be successful in trying to bring greater stability to these communities that have experienced so much chaos in recent years.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true, from what I just described -- it took me a long time to describe it; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take even much longer to successfully implement it and to allow that strategy to take root.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s no time like the present to try to advance that kind of strategy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in over the last several months.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that there is more that we can do to recruit and train local Sunni tribal fighters.\xc2\xa0 And that will be a part of this ongoing effort as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday when you said there\xe2\x80\x99s not a complete strategy yet on this training mission, does he have a timeline for when he will have the complete strategy on the training mission?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has asked his team, as he frequently does, to be in a constant state of refining and optimizing the strategy that we have in place.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that one element that is in need of refining is this effort to train, equip, and offer advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 And so this will be an ongoing process, but this is something that the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 At the risk of sounding like a blowhard, when I was in Iraq 10 years ago, Bush administration, they were going to train everyone with American trainers.\xc2\xa0 Spent a lot of time at combat outposts -- great trainers, but it was very clear to anyone who spent a day there or two days there that the problems were not problems that could be cured by trainers.\xc2\xa0 They were things like a culture of cowardly leadership at the company battalion level, completely unprofessional NCO corps; that it\xe2\x80\x99s more cronies than professionals; corrupt logistics, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t supplying things correctly; ghost soldiers.\xc2\xa0 And when you read the descriptions of the collapse of the Iraqi military in places like Mosul, you could see the same sort of elements there that weren\xe2\x80\x99t just political problems, but they were endemic, operational problems in the Iraqi army that can\xe2\x80\x99t be cured just by having trainers train people.</p>\n<p>Do you have a sense now whether those fatal operational problems in the Iraqi army have been cured?\xc2\xa0 Or that this training will actually do more than help a little bit so that it takes a few seconds longer for them to collapse?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I think what I would say is -- I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking is a perfectly legitimate question, and many of the problems that you have identified based on your own experience covering this conflict years ago I do think, in the mind of the President, can be traced back to inherent political problems; that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a central government that\xe2\x80\x99s committed to pursuing an inclusive brand of leadership that includes a multi-sectarian security force, that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the kinds of problems that you have just talked about.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to see corruption.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to see fighters who aren\xe2\x80\x99t committed to the safety and security of the entire country, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to erode morale.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President prioritized from the very beginning the establishment of a central government in Iraq that was ready to not just make promises, but actually live up to the pursuit of a multi-sectarian inclusive governing agenda.\xc2\xa0 And so far, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Prime Minister Abadi.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s because of Prime Minister Abadi\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to that inclusive governing style, that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a corresponding investment from the United States and the broader international community.</p>\n<p>Because the President\xe2\x80\x99s view wa, all of our investments in training a equipping would not have the desired effect if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a corresponding commitment from the central government to address the political problems that had plagued the Maliki administration.\xc2\xa0 But because of the commitment from Prime Minister Abadi, we are optimistic that the kind of investment that the United States and our coalition partners are making in Iraq now are more likely to take root and be successful.</p>\n<p>Shannon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s comments on King v. Burwell yesterday, as we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for a decision, he said he was optimistic that the court would \xe2\x80\x9cplay it straight\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to the decision on the subsidies.\xc2\xa0 So what is the implication there if you all don\xe2\x80\x99t win that case?\xc2\xa0 That the justices are playing politics with the issue, or that they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do their jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that this is a straightforward case.\xc2\xa0 And in the mind of the President, as he mentioned yesterday, this is probably a case that the Supreme Court shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even taken up.\xc2\xa0 But as long as they have, the President believes that the reading of the law is quite clear -- and this is a case that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me make many times.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, this is also a case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Republican staffers on Capitol Hill who have also validated that those who wrote this legislation intended for every single American, regardless of which state they live in, who is eligible to collect tax credits, to do so to make their health insurance more affordable.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty straightforward reading of the law in the mind of the President and in the mind of many -- the vast majority of legal scholars who have taken a look at this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President indicated that he was optimistic about the outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are we to do with Jonathan Gruber\xe2\x80\x99s comments then, who has taken credit for participating in helping to draft the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act, saying that essentially the idea was that states that didn\xe2\x80\x99t set up exchanges would not get these subsidies and credits?\xc2\xa0 Their residence would pay out, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the benefit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for his comments. All I can do is I can account for the comments of many Republican staffers on Capitol Hill, who said that the law was intended to ensure that every citizen, regardless of which state they lived in, could collect tax credits to make their health insurance more affordable if, in fact, their income level was at the appropriate level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you lose, what\xe2\x80\x99s the implication about the Court and its reasoning in coming to that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position where we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to lose.\xc2\xa0 Because of the power -- because of the strength of our arguments and because what we believe is the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to -- as the President mentioned -- playing it straight, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident about the outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question.\xc2\xa0 The administration\xe2\x80\x99s filing June 2nd with the FISA Court regarding renewing collection -- bulk collection of data to reverse the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Clapper case, the only federal appellate decision that\xe2\x80\x99s found that the program is being used improperly -- essentially, in this filing, telling the FISA Court to disregard that ruling.\xc2\xa0 So you think the Second Circuit got it wrong?\xc2\xa0 Do you intend to appeal it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the thing that we have said -- and this is what we said shortly after the Second Circuit issued their ruling and while the Congress was debating the USA FREEDOM Act -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the administration, speaking generally, that the reforms that are included in the USA FREEDOM Act would address the concerns that were raised by the Second Circuit.\xc2\xa0 There may be an opportunity for the Second Circuit to eventually reach that conclusion on their own, but because of the kinds of reforms that the President encouraged Congress to pass in the context of this bill, we believe that it does strike an appropriate balance between the need to keep the country safe with the need to protect our civil liberties.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a time frame for anticipating whether or not you will appeal either to -- hearing of the Second Circuit or the Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timing for that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice on that.</p>\n<p>Andrew.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was some reports that Lisa Monaco and Ash Carter are working on a new plan to close the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Is that the case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Drew, it has long been a priority of the President -- frankly, since his first day in office -- to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is -- well, there are many reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President believes that continuing to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay serves primarily as a recruiting tool for terrorists and extremists around the globe.\xc2\xa0 The cost of operating that prison is prohibitively expensive and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve the best interest of the American people.</p>\n<p>The fact is, this administration has demonstrated time and time again that we can bring those individuals to justice, many of them through criminal courts here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 There are any number of extremists and terrorists that have been convicted of very serious crimes and put away and brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 But there are also other proceedings through military commissions and others that can dispense with these cases.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes -- and has believed for a long time -- that the interest of the United States would be best served by closing the prison.\xc2\xa0 And this is an effort that we have doggedly pursued, even in the face of strident opposition from members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing new to announce?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to share with you at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on a completely different subject, has anybody told the First Lady about Robert Gibbs going to McDonalds?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if she has received the news.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously I had an opportunity to work closely with Robert both on the campaign and here at the White House -- and the folks at McDonalds have just hired themselves one of the most effective and articulate communications professionals in the country.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So, Josh, why did the President give a speech on health care today?\xc2\xa0 Is he still concerned about public opinion, or did he have a different audience in mind?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the first, Cheryl, is he received an invitation from the Catholic Health Association to speak to their group.\xc2\xa0 He was pleased to accept and he did believe that it was an appropriate venue to talk about the enormous benefits of the Affordable Care Act that has made life better for millions of Americans -- and not just the 16 million Americans who have gotten health care since the Affordable Care Act took effect, but also the millions of other Americans who have enjoyed the benefits of the slowest growth in health care costs in history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are individuals who -- again, millions of Americans who no longer have to worry about being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 This is the millions of women all across the country that don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be worried about being charged more for their health insurance just because they\xe2\x80\x99re women.</p>\n<p>So this gave the President an opportunity to make a case that probably was familiar to all of you but one that he obviously enjoys making.</p>\n<p>Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On health care, one quick one to start with.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention, speaking to this Catholic group, anything about the HHS mandate, which has obviously been a point of controversy with Catholics.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Fred, I can talk to you about lots of things that were included in the speech.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to account for the things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And as far as King v. Burwell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how this could cause utter chaos.\xc2\xa0 The President talked yesterday in Germany about the consequences if the Court rules against the administration.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get your thoughts.\xc2\xa0 Should the Court in your opinion consider the social consequences of its ruling, or should they purely stick strictly to the legal argument?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I am confident that the nine justices of the Supreme Court know much more about what it is they should do than I do.\xc2\xa0 So I would be among the last people to tell them exactly what decision they should make or how they should make it.\xc2\xa0 They have an independent responsibility to evaluate the arguments and reach a conclusion.\xc2\xa0 And each of them is eminently qualified to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll express the same confidence that the President did yesterday about their ability to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last one on this.\xc2\xa0 The President said today that none of the predictions have come true about this, but yet there have been reports about people who have been shifted to new insurance policies through their work, that people have been put in new networks so they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to see new doctors in some cases. That was something that came up -- if you like your doctor, you can keep it, if you like your health plan, you can keep it.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that was -- was that one of those dire predictions that did come true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Fred, that was the circumstance in the health care market before the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that there are a lot of people who had to change their health care plan because they got sick and because their health care plan tried to drop them.\xc2\xa0 No longer can health care plans do that because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the power of this law and the impact that it\xe2\x80\x99s had -- the positive impact that it\xe2\x80\x99s had on people all across the country.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh -- (inaudible) the deputy head of China central military commission, is coming to visit the White House this Friday.\xc2\xa0 Would you please disclose some agenda and details -- will he meet with President Obama?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that particular visit, but let me have one of my colleagues in the National Security Council get back with you and we can give you a better sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s planned for the visit.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:20 P.M.
