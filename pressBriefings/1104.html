EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for coming to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have with me here today two people who can tell you about the tangible, even historic, benefits of compromise. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron Bloom is the Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy.\xc2\xa0 Heather Zichal is the Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy Policy.\xc2\xa0 Together they worked closely with teams from the Department of Transportation and the EPA to reach, as I said, an historic agreement on fuel economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will turn it over to them.\xc2\xa0 If you have questions for them about their issues, obviously ask them.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get those done at the top, and then I will return to the podium to take your questions on other matters.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 As Jay said, President Obama today announced an historic agreement with 13 major auto manufacturers representing over 90 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States today.\xc2\xa0 This agreement forges historic -- was an historic agreement that nearly doubled fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Achieving the goals of this historic program will rely on innovative technologies and manufacturing that will spur economic growth and create high-quality domestic jobs in cutting-edge industries across the country.\xc2\xa0 Today\'s announcement builds on President Obama\'s agreement for model year 2012 to 2016 auto standards which will raise fuel efficiency to 35.5 miles per gallon, and begin saving families money at the pump this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Together, these agreements will save American families $1.7 trillion in fuel costs, and by 2025, result in an average fuel savings of over $8,000 per vehicle.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, these programs will dramatically cut the oil we consume, saving a total of 12 billion barrels of oil, and by 2025, reduce oil consumption by 2.2 million barrels a day -- as much as half of the oil we import from OPEC every day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were a lot of people that helped forge this historic agreement today -- from the UAW to the state of California, environmental NGOs, members of Congress, and others.\xc2\xa0 But it was the leadership from Ford, GM and Chrysler, as well as 10 other companies that joined the President today that truly deserve the bulk of the credit for their leadership and commitment to a plan that will reduce our dependence on oil, grow the economy, and leave for future generations a more secure and prosperous America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, we\'ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anybody have questions?\xc2\xa0 Jake?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One complaint I\'ve heard about improved fuel efficiency standards is that it means vehicles are not necessarily as safe as bigger, clunkier, but ultimately perhaps safer vehicles.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could address that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 Certainly.\xc2\xa0 I think with any rule, whether it was the model year 2012 or 2016 standard, or what we\'re looking to do in the future, we will be relying on additional technologies that help us achieve those fuel savings.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not going to come at the expense of American safety.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking a lot about different combustion engine technologies, different off-cycle credits, a host of different technologies that will help us achieve those standards and protect consumer choice at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 And I would add the DOT, which was a critical part of this dialogue, when they look at these questions and put out the technical assessment, which they did in conjunction with EPA, the issue of safety is always paramount to the obligations of DOT.\xc2\xa0 So we are very confident that there will be no compromise in safety, and that has been kind of baked into all the analysis that we did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the economic impact?\xc2\xa0 Because at the beginning some of the automakers were not that excited to get on -- they eventually came on.\xc2\xa0 But to double the fuel efficiency in about a decade is going to mean pressure to their bottom line at a time when the economy is still struggling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the automakers were challenged by these standards, and we don\'t apologize for challenging them.\xc2\xa0 Saving the American consumers $1.7 trillion is a worthwhile endeavor.\xc2\xa0 We are confident that the automobile manufacturers will be able to absorb the additional costs and still sell cars for a profit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, they reached, and we think that\'s a good thing because we think the American people are saying -- and if you watch how car manufacturers advertise their cars, the American people are saying they care about fuel economy.\xc2\xa0 And so if they want to sell cars to Americans, they\'re going to need to improve fuel economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is an example of industry deciding to lead the parade -- seeing the trends, seeing what consumers want and deciding to get out in front of it.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is exactly the kind of smart regulation that we need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much will these standards raise the average price of a car?\xc2\xa0 Is that anything you all have done, I guess, the math or the statistics of?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as I said, the standards overall we expect will save consumers $8,000 in fuel costs.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, as we were having discussions with the auto companies, as well as the DOT and EPA, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing analysis about where is the right place to land this policy.\xc2\xa0 That factor was obviously on the table for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as the -- I think the technical analysis that you will see as this rule comes to proposal, obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.\xc2\xa0 But at the end of the day, these costs end up saving -- these initial investments end up saving consumers over the life of the program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that $8,000 include the potential extra cost of hybrid technology or whatever it might be?\xc2\xa0 Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 They do not.\xc2\xa0 But we are very confident that the savings are a multiple of any additional cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does anybody else have questions on this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Crystal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 As automakers begin to implement these new standards, will it create jobs as well?\xc2\xa0 Will they need to bring more people on board to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think any time there\xe2\x80\x99s innovation, you see good economic activity and you see jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the President in his speech this morning cited two small examples.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a huge amount of innovation going on in the automobile industry today.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, when you put a tough standard out there, I think there will be new kinds of activities, because whether it\xe2\x80\x99s batteries or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s other technologies, that\xe2\x80\x99s, in fact, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on right now.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the companies themselves or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s entrepreneurs who are in their basements right now imagining how they can be suppliers to the D3, we do believe this will cause a lot of economic activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on the question of the economic impact, is there a concern that these standards could drive up the price of vehicles beyond the reach of any consumers and hit demand?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked very closely at that.\xc2\xa0 Our judgment is that the savings that consumers will receive will be a significant multiple of any increase in price, so that from the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s perspective they will be way ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you look at how people are acting in the marketplace, people are taking account of the fuel economy of a car when they buy one.\xc2\xa0 Two, three years ago, trucks were much larger a percentage of total vehicle sales than they are today.\xc2\xa0 And the reason people have moved to cars is because they are conscious of fuel economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that consumers will see that, and when the companies are advertising and they look at how the companies are advertising -- when they are advertising high-mileage cars, consumers are taking that into account.\xc2\xa0 So obviously to implement some of these technologies will have some additional cost, but the net benefit to consumers will be enormous.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like a leverage or a multiplier effect.\xc2\xa0 What about the price point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think when people buy a car, part of what they take into account when they buy it is how many times they have to go buy gasoline.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said this morning, if I have to fill up every week, I have a different view than if I fill up every two weeks.\xc2\xa0 And so we believe -- and I think this is what consumer behavior is showing -- that people are taking that into account in terms of their buying habits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate that any of these companies in making these changes will need future incentives, specifically funding from the government, a year, five years down the road?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the conversation we had with the companies specifically focused on what was technologically available and achievable while preserving consumer choice and ensuring that we were building the cars and trucks of the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you guys very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, ladies and gentlemen, with that, we can go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 And I want to just -- before I start, I know that I have been spending a great deal of time in the front row in particular, but the front two rows, so I really want to try to move to give other people a chance to get their questions in today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask one. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it seems like you\'ve laid out very well what has to happen to get through the matters on the Hill before you can come to a compromise.\xc2\xa0 I know the House isn\xe2\x80\x99t done yet.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a key issue is this matter of a trigger -- how do you make sure that Congress actually takes up deficit reduction without that enforcement mechanism being the debt limit, as Republicans insist it must.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House involved in any way in negotiating that issue right now in these waning hours?\xc2\xa0 Or do you legitimately have to wait until all the voting is done before you tackle this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the broad answer to your question is, yes, in both parts, which is we are involved in conversations about what an end product could look like, a compromise that allows us to do what we absolutely must do, as the President said this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that your analysis of a major issue that needs to be resolved is accurate.\xc2\xa0 It is also true that the leaders of the House on the Republican side have been very focused for days now, and in some ways if you consider the measure they took up and passed last week, for more than a week now, a week and a half, with drafting, redrafting legislation that, as it moves along, only becomes less and less bipartisan, more and more partisan, more narrowly crafted to appeal to only a sub-section of even the House of Representatives, and therefore not moving in the direction where everyone needs to arrive, which is towards compromise.\xc2\xa0 And that has been their preoccupation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So because Congress has to take action to resolve the issue of the need to raise the debt ceiling so the United States can pay its bills, we do have to wait for that process to play out before we can get focused on legitimately solving this problem.\xc2\xa0 So we are continuing to have conversations as we wait for the House to finish this business of theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Alister.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned the United States has already suffered lasting damage to its reputation with international investors?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that we are concerned because there is certainly evidence that the economy has suffered because of the uncertainty created around this debate and the circus atmosphere of our politics around what should be a serious matter, treated seriously, because we are talking about the full faith and credit of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the thing that matters most to Americans, which is the health of our economy and the capacity of our economy to grow and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So some damage has been done.\xc2\xa0 Now, we are a powerful country with a powerful economy, and we are the United States of America, and the American people are very resilient.\xc2\xa0 We need to resolve this, and we can get on with the task of making sure we are doing everything we can to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that further damage isn\xe2\x80\x99t done, which is precisely why any measure that suggests we should be having this debate again at the end of the year is just a wildly bad idea.\xc2\xa0 And any measure that suggests we should be having this debate in a way that will require the kind of votes that we\xe2\x80\x99re now talking about -- when you see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the House and the efforts to get a bare majority to pass a highly partisan measure -- does anyone really think that we can -- that it is plausible to hold the American economy hostage to a two-thirds vote in the House and the Senate? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a dangerous game, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not what the American people want their elected representatives to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And my second question is scheduling.\xc2\xa0 Will the President invite the congressional leaders back to the White House this weekend as he did last Saturday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alister, anything is certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 And again, we are monitoring the situation in the Congress and we will see what conversations and meetings might take place in the future.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any to announce now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President on Monday called on the American people to put pressure on their representatives in Washington -- he did so again today -- by reaching out by phone or email.\xc2\xa0 Is the President himself reaching out by phone to members of Congress to put pressure on them, in addition to what he did today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said several times from here, and others have, that the administration, the White House, at a variety of levels, including the highest levels, have been engaged in conversations and discussions with leaders of the House and the Senate and other members.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to read out specific phone calls or meetings, but those conversations are taking place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in answer -- really in answer to your earlier question, those conversations are taking place, but we are also having to\xc2\xa0 -- because this is a congressional action that needs to take place, there\'s a lot of energy being expended on what is essentially an exercise to pass the measure before the House now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a readout necessarily, just wondering if the President is picking the phone up and making some calls.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you can be sure that folks here at all levels are having conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You sort of touched on this yesterday, but in terms of the President using up so much oxygen focused on this one issue, does he ever have any concerns that he\'s not able to give the kind of focus that he needs to give to some of these other issues -- foreign policy issues -- that cross his desk?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 The President has a full schedule that includes a lot of other issues besides this one, including, very importantly, national security matters. He meets, as he did this morning, with his national security team, gets updated on what\'s happening around the world.\xc2\xa0 And he is able to do that, of course, as he focuses on this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But make no mistake.\xc2\xa0 The American economy, the health of the economy, the fate of the economy when what is at stake is a question about whether or not we will be creditworthy is a top, top priority.\xc2\xa0 It is his focus right now because it absolutely should be his focus. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The former director of national intelligence, retired Admiral Dennis Blair, said, I believe yesterday, that drone attacks -- unilateral drone attacks in Pakistan actually did more harm to U.S. national security interests than good, and he called for I believe a stronger partnership with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have an opinion about these remarks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without addressing specific methods, I would say simply that we believe our relationship with Pakistan is essential to fighting terrorism and terrorists, fighting al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we work hard on that relationship even though it is complicated and difficult at times. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also make no apologies for the need to go after terrorists, members of al Qaeda, wherever they are.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly true about the mission to eliminate Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- I understand that that creates tension.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- we engage with the Pakistanis to discuss these issues all the time.\xc2\xa0 But the relationship is important and, obviously, fighting terrorism is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an idea of what you think a compromise bill looks like, whether -- the general parameters --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said today, there are so many -- there are many roads out of this mess, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not that complicated when you look at what is contained within -- what was contained within the original measure put forward by the Speaker of the House and the measure that the Senate Majority Leader is putting forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity here to achieve significant deficit reduction; create a joint committee in Congress that will take up the tough issues of entitlement reform and tax reform that this President believes needs to be addressed; to have an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the Congress acts on these proposals put forward by that committee; and that lifts the cloud hanging over our economy, this issue of the debt ceiling, through 2012. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How far are you willing to go?\xc2\xa0 How far is the President willing to go when it comes to triggers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the specifics of a compromise from here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating with anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what our -- our lines are pretty clear here.\xc2\xa0 As anyone who is witnessing this debate this week, this process, can attest, this is not something we should repeat any time in the near future, because it is harmful to the economy; the uncertainty it creates will only add further harm to the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that is a position the President holds very strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also is committed to reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he supports Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, which significantly reduces the deficit, up front, with cuts -- cuts that overlap in large measure with some of the cuts put forward by the Speaker in his original measure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is room for compromise here if there is will.\xc2\xa0 It is not that difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give an idea -- the triggers is really what it\xe2\x80\x99s about right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there are a variety of mechanisms -- when you talk about enforcement mechanisms, sometimes called triggers, there are a variety of ways to compel Congress to act because you create something that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced that makes it onerous for both Republicans and Democrats not to act.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\xe2\x80\x99s enforced spending cuts or enforced revenue raisers, there\xe2\x80\x99s some history here of how that works.\xc2\xa0 And, again, if there is a will to examine that process, a will to recognize that we need to compromise and get out of this situation so that no further harm is done to the American economy, this can be done relatively quickly.\xc2\xa0 There is ample time to achieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said it\xe2\x80\x99s not that complicated, there\xe2\x80\x99s an easy compromise here.\xc2\xa0 And yet -- and the President is backing Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s plan in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And yet his plan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are not onboard on that.\xc2\xa0 And so they say that when they hear from the White House \xe2\x80\x9ccompromise,\xe2\x80\x9d that it\xe2\x80\x99s only directed at the Republicans, that the Democrats aren\xe2\x80\x99t being asked to compromise either.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve watched this closely enough to understand how untrue that is, because look at Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s measure.\xc2\xa0 First of all, it achieves the arbitrary goal -- utterly arbitrary goal -- of doing dollar-for-dollar in deficit reduction -- or spending cuts, rather -- and lifting of the debt ceiling -- a dangerously arbitrary goal, okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- some Republicans call phony.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s phony about it?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s their goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The defense -- Iraq and Afghanistan funding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about overseas contingency funds, basically funding of our wars, that was accounted for in the Ryan budget -- the much-celebrated Ryan budget in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 It was accounted for in every bipartisan proposal that was seriously addressed in Washington these last several months, including between the Speaker of the House and the President of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- and, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll address that.\xc2\xa0 You get savings from policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 If you decide, as Chairman Ryan put forward, that you need to end Medicare as we know it and reform it to extract significant savings from it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to beat a dead horse --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- you can count those savings.\xc2\xa0 If you want to make policy decisions that wind down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, you can count those savings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in any case, even the first $1.2 or 3 trillion of savings that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about overlap.\xc2\xa0 This is a lot of money here.\xc2\xa0 This is a lot of savings.\xc2\xa0 A lot of deep and substantial cuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no upfront revenue in Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.\xc2\xa0 It is just simply preposterous to suggest that it is not -- does not represent an effort to come halfway towards the Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House involved in lobbying Senator McConnell to get onboard Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s plan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go back to my -- to the answer that I gave to Dan, that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in a lot of conversations. Obviously Congress is focused on the legislation it\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with now.\xc2\xa0 We are having conversations on the topic of what happens once people finally acknowledge that the activity that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the House now is moot and irrelevant because it\xe2\x80\x99s the measure that will, if it passes, that passes out of the House, will be dead on arrival, and we need to get to the endgame here of finding a compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times at the highest levels, there are phone calls happening from here.\xc2\xa0 And yet Joe Manchin, who is one of the conservative Democratic senators who would be a swing vote here was on MSNBC this morning and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the President more engaged to talk to us, call some of us, get in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s face.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 If you have a conservative Democrat --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen those.\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen those comments.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can assure you that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But assuming he\'s telling the truth --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Ed, honestly --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you presume that, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve all been here for the past several weeks. The idea that the President is not engaged is simply preposterous.\xc2\xa0 So I say again --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which a Democratic senator said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, and again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of Senator Manchin\xe2\x80\x99s comment, but I think overall the President has amply demonstrated his level of engagement --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he\xe2\x80\x99s not talking to a Democratic senator who is about one of five or six conservatives --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I said I didn\'t see --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- who would be persuadable --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is, if the President is not talking to one of five or six conservative Democrats who are persuadable here, how are these phone calls moving towards an endgame?\xc2\xa0 Who is he talking to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Persuadable?\xc2\xa0 Fifty-three --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- one of these folks who is in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I will say upfront that I am not aware of that comment.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- persuadable in what direction?\xc2\xa0 Fifty-three United States senators of the Democratic Party signed a letter saying they will not support the Boehner measure, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid is now saying he\xe2\x80\x99s going to amend his version, and no one knows how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be amended. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And we are having these conversations, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they will include Senator Manchin as well as many others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try to get at this McConnell question one other way, because I think if you will agree with the premise that the key here seems to be Senate Republicans at this point.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any indication that Mitch McConnell is going to do anything other than stand foursquare behind Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s bill when, and if, it gets to the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mike, all I will say is that I understand that Republicans would like -- if they controlled all levers of the government, would like some measures to become law.\xc2\xa0 I understand that Democrats, if they controlled the House, the Senate and the White House, would like some measures to become law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 A compromise is the only option.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s -- you can support and say that I stand strongly behind what has been produced here, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s clear. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have reason to believe that McConnell --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have reason to believe, as the President said at the end of his remarks today, that there will be an assessment that we have to do something and the only thing that gets us there is something that\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 That is just the case.\xc2\xa0 The Democrats control the Senate; Republicans control the House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, you mentioned the word \xe2\x80\x9cbipartisan.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How does it promote an atmosphere of bipartisanship for the President to encourage citizens to call for recalcitrant lawmakers and, to use his campaign apparatus, to tweet out the Twitter handles of Republicans to encourage them -- to encourage people to sort of jump all over folks to get them to vote?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does that foster a sense of cooperation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President has called for is for those Americans who believe that we need compromise in Washington, to communicate that to their members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 That can be Democrats or Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That is hardly a partisan message.\xc2\xa0 It is explicitly a bipartisan message.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re only tweeting Republicans, not Democrats.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the problem we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing here is a lack of willingness to compromise by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But the message here is -- and the message of the negotiations the President had with the Speaker, the message that we have had throughout is that we are willing to compromise; we are willing to meet you halfway and beyond in order to resolve these issues. We are willing to deal with the arbitrary association of raising the debt ceiling with spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re willing to discuss tough issues like entitlement reform, getting savings out of those programs, and make tough decisions and bring along Democrats to take that vote if we have a partner in compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it is simply a call on Americans of all political persuasion to ask their members, their elected representatives, if they support compromise, to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why use the campaign account to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everybody has got a stake here, Mike.\xc2\xa0 This is not a political game.\xc2\xa0 The American economy hangs in the balance, okay?\xc2\xa0 We need to take action so that the United States of America does not default for the first time in its history.\xc2\xa0 This is deadly serious and we need everyone to recognize that the only way to do this is through compromise.\xc2\xa0 It is not for one part of one house of Congress to dictate to all of Washington what it, in an ideal world, would like to see happen, because that\xe2\x80\x99s stalemate and we need to break the stalemate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what the President means by a \xe2\x80\x9csmart and balanced trigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And is the White House staff or the President offering specific options to members of Congress --\xc2\xa0 leaders as they negotiate this?\xc2\xa0 Or is he just giving those broad outlines of what he would like to see?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are already in conversations with lawmakers about what a compromise would look like.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s bill is an excellent vehicle for that.\xc2\xa0 But there are -- and Senator McConnell, as the President mentioned, put forward a measure that can be helpful in that.\xc2\xa0 There are ways to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, as I talked about before, this issue of an enforcement mechanism is an important one.\xc2\xa0 And I know that people are getting specific about different ideas.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specific ideas from here.\xc2\xa0 A lot of them are pretty well known for the folks who study budgets and enforcement mechanisms.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is not okay is to do this whole debate again by holding another extension of the debt ceiling hostage to the agenda of one faction of one house of Congress that does not have majority support and certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- beyond that, there are so many options.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does he mean by \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Balanced, I think, would be one way to look at this, as I think I addressed earlier, is that if you have a mechanism that requires action by the Congress, and if not, then there\xe2\x80\x99s a trigger that has spending cuts and revenue increases that would be balanced.\xc2\xa0 So it has to be -- by balanced, it simply means -- and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to involve spending cuts and revenue increases, but it has to put pressure on both sides, equal pressure on both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just quickly, given that we\xe2\x80\x99re coming down to the wire and the Senate could still be voting on Tuesday, is the President -- does he think that he should do the few days extension so that votes aren\xe2\x80\x99t coming within hours of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we still believe that we can get this done in time to meet the deadline of August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that if we are in a situation where we need a couple of days to finish an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in train, we would certainly consider that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think we\xe2\x80\x99re at that point yet or we\xe2\x80\x99re not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still at the point where we believe if the action is taken, that there is time to take it and finish this by Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have an answer for Senator Orrin Hatch, who railed on the Senate floor yesterday about the administration not taking the American people into his confidence and letting them know in advance what programs will be funded and what won\xe2\x80\x99t be funded come August 2nd?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we believe that Senator Hatch and others will in the end do the responsible thing, which is ensure that that never comes to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would point out that Senator Hatch is one of a number of Republican senators who in 2003, May of 2003 -- Senators Alexander, Chambliss, Collins, Cornyn, Crapo, Enzi, Graham, Grassley, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kyl, Lugar, McCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Roberts, Shelby, Snowe, Hatch, and Sessions -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was doing the Senate clerk imitation -- sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 They all voted yes on a measure to increase the debt ceiling for 18 months, beyond the reelection campaign of the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 They thought it was the right thing to do for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important thing to remember, which is that this is not about politics, this is about the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to focus on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wants to focus on letting the American people know are they going to get Social Security checks, disability checks --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I understand and I refer you to Treasury. They will -- it will not be today, but they will as we get closer --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you may be surprised to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I know, and what I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99re telling you, is that as we get closer to that date, they will provide more information about how they would manage that truly difficult situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s the Friday before Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Can you say when?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to Treasury.\xc2\xa0 Mark, thanks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we see the contingency plans being laid out this weekend in Treasury?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will simply say that as we get closer to that date.\xc2\xa0 So there is four days before that date, so it could be this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a date, because I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to Treasury. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, would the President like to see more from the business community right now in terms of pressuring lawmakers to try and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been heartened to see how much support for the idea of compromise there is.\xc2\xa0 He is -- we are certainly aware of the concern in the business community that this has created, the dampening effect that the uncertainty has caused to the economy.\xc2\xa0 And he is encouraged by those who have spoken out about the need to resolve this issue and ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have this kind of uncertainty hanging over us as we go forward; and try to do the things we need to do to build the economy, to ensure that it grows more strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- all these outside advisory groups and some of the biggest names in the world and CEOs from big business, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they out more in front pressuring lawmakers?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they\'re private individuals, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell them what they are seeing with their own eyes, which is the negative impact of this uncertainty, far more negative than any other alleged uncertainty created by other actions that might have been taken by this administration.\xc2\xa0 This is a real problem potentially for the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to take action to resolve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and other business groups endorsing the Boehner plan. What does that say about the effort of the White House over the last six months to win over business interests?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that everyone wants this to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 What I do believe is that as more and more folks have focused this week on the kind of process we\xe2\x80\x99re going through just to resolve this one time, the prospect of doing it again in just a few months -- which essentially means that we\xe2\x80\x99d be living with this uncertainty, steadily, from now until the next time -- the prospect of trying to do this, as suggested by some stories I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about how they\xe2\x80\x99re fixing the measure or changing the measure, moving it -- making it more partisan -- that it would make it even more difficult and more impossible to essentially hold the American economy hostage to a two-thirds vote to amend the Constitution -- amend the Constitution or default is a highly dangerous game to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my answer to the question is we believe that as each day goes by and people see how unhealthy -- to cite, to quote Senator Corker -- how unhealthy this is for our economy, more and more people will see the need to do this for an extended period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re describing why the White House opposes the Boehner plan, but my question is why has the White House been unable to persuade business groups that it\xe2\x80\x99s made such an outreach to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have more of an answer.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing a lot of voices who agree that we need to extend it further.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jack Lew was spotted I think outside the Capitol today. Could you describe a little bit about what he and Tim Geithner and some of the other folks are doing, specifically today, yesterday, what kind of groups they\xe2\x80\x99re talking to, what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does Dan know that he was spotted outside the Capitol?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We are having conversations, in some cases face to face, with lawmakers about how we can move this process forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that -- I have to ask again -- we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer, and now Steny Hoyer has endorsed a 14th Amendment option, can you say that the White House has ruled out a 14th Amendment option?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the President the power to ignore the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Congress has the authorities necessary to ensure that we meet our obligations -- obligations that Congress created.\xc2\xa0 Important point.\xc2\xa0 This is not about giving anyone a blank check to spend.\xc2\xa0 It is about paying bills that have already been rung up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Defaulting on our debt is not an option.\xc2\xa0 There are no arguments that can avoid the basic truth that if we fail to act, it will have devastating consequences for our jobs and our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me just repeat:\xc2\xa0 This administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the President the power to ignore the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on one quick thing.\xc2\xa0 Given that the GDP numbers came out today confirming that it slowed the first half of the country -- first half of the year -- even more than expected, will the President -- would he like to see, in whatever compromises emerge -- compromise -- an extension of the payroll tax relief and the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, Jackie.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made very -- the President has made very clear that we support an extension of the payroll tax cut, a tax cut for every working American that has helped put money in their pocket, that has put money in their pocket, to deal with spikes in gasoline prices, for example, this year, and that he believes we ought to extend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether that\xe2\x80\x99s part of a compromise now or something we do later in the year so that we can extend it for next year is certainly something we support because it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to help continue -- to keep the economy growing and growing faster -- you noted the GDP numbers -- and creating jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In those GDP numbers, does the President see the effect of the uncertainty --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the GDP numbers -- revision of the first quarter and new second quarter -- I think what I understand, and I will not go far on this because I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I have not gotten my Ph.D. yet, but we do see a lot of impact from the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, a lot of negative consequences of high energy prices and things like that in those numbers. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the important thing is we need to continue to take the measures necessary to keep our economy to grow.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely do not need to do things -- we must not, should not do things that cause uncertainty, that hurt our economy, reduce growth and reduce job creation.\xc2\xa0 And monkeying around with the full faith and credit of the United States is exactly that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see a double-dip recession coming?\xc2\xa0 The Federal Reserve says in about half the cases when the GDP goes down below 2 percent for two quarters, in half those cases, the country is in recession within a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the economy will continue to grow and that we will continue to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously -- we have to focus on this and keep working.\xc2\xa0 We think there were some specific things that were responsible for those numbers not being as high as we\xe2\x80\x99d obviously like to see them.\xc2\xa0 But let me go back to the point here:\xc2\xa0 What we can do to ensure that that does not happen is take appropriate action in the next four or five days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also note just in these GDP numbers, this was a far look back that included a reevaluation of fourth quarter 2008, which is now calculated to have seen a contraction in the economy of almost 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 These are historic levels.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a recession the depths of which we still are only now understanding, and also revision -- revised numbers for the first quarter of 2009, when the President took office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The calamity that befell this country in 2008 and early 2009 had a profound impact, and we were very close, potentially, if necessary measures weren\xe2\x80\x99t taken, to having visited upon us a second Great Depression.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has explained why he does not support a balanced budget amendment.\xc2\xa0 But if language were in the House and Senate versions passing -- approving a balanced budget amendment, passing it on to the states, is that something the President would veto?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of -- so many ifs in there, and it will stop after --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, because it\xe2\x80\x99s now in the House language.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed that a few times even though I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked about it.\xc2\xa0 The idea that when you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to get votes to pass a measure that we have to take action on, and instead of making it more bipartisan -- because bipartisan is the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to create a law here and get something through the Senate -- making it more partisan, and if, as you describe, attaching to it a requirement for a vote on a balanced budget amendment, I mean, this is not serious.\xc2\xa0 This is dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we do not need to amend the -- you cannot have a scenario here where you tell -- you say, we have to amend the Constitution or default on America\xe2\x80\x99s obligations.\xc2\xa0 This is not what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 They want a compromise that can get the support of Republicans and Democrats, and that this President can sign.\xc2\xa0 And that compromise is not that hard to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, now that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to recalibrate a compromise in the last couple of days leading up to the deadline, could you tell us who the President is talking to, getting advice --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked so many times --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- who we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to read out conversations, okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Beyond Hill lawmakers, beyond people here at the White House and beyond Warren Buffett, is the President reaching out to people like small business leaders?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to anyone?\xc2\xa0 Has he picked up the phone and called people like that?\xc2\xa0 Has he called average Americans just to talk?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I just -- I don\'t have anything to give you in terms of the President private schedule, conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s having.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he obviously talks to a lot of people, but I don\'t have any specifics for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then, I mean, we just heard him just now at the event talking about -- he\xe2\x80\x99s playing poker now, talking to them.\xc2\xa0 I mean, who is he talking to about this?\xc2\xa0 Average Americans, business leaders, people who would be impacted?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get specific about phone calls or conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s having.\xc2\xa0 But he does, as you know, receive letters that he reads every night from Americans across the country that are carefully selected to give him a sense of what people are experiencing and feeling out there.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about that and how important that is to him, and that continues to be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is going to sound exactly like what Dan and April are asking, but I promise it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Mr. Daley -- yesterday afternoon, Mr. Daley on CNN --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on his conversations.\xc2\xa0 Sorry. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, all the way -- yes, sir. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, is paying interest owed to the debt-holder the top priority to the government no matter the U.S. can raise the debt ceiling?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the Treasury Department for that, and I think they will tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about how they would manage this impossible situation if it were to come to pass.\xc2\xa0 We obviously hope and believe it will not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other question is, the President is going to meet four African Presidents this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Why now and what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this goes to another -- relates to another question that was asked about whether or not the President is able to focus on other matters.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, he is able to, and he must because he\xe2\x80\x99s the President and he has significant responsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, the President will meet with the President of Benin, the President of Guinea, President of Niger, and the President of Cote D\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire.\xc2\xa0 The meeting provides an opportunity to underscore the administration\xe2\x80\x99s support for emerging democracies to highlight our partnerships with these countries and to discuss the building of strong democratic institutions, economic development and a range of regional issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that help? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 What is the highest level of contact that you can confirm between anyone in the administration and anyone in foreign governments who hold U.S. debt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has conversations with foreign leaders with some regularity, but I have no conversations of that nature to confirm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the President, anyone else in the administration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have any conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when we read out conversations, we let you know.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any to do now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We heard from Valerie Jarrett yesterday the President is getting virtually no sleep.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us personally how he\xe2\x80\x99s handled the past --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, this is a focus and a priority of his, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of great concern.\xc2\xa0 I think that he -- I spent time with him this morning.\xc2\xa0 I spent a lot of time with him yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He seems very well rested and very focused and energetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the level of concern with monkeying around, the circus, words like \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous\xe2\x80\x9d and now adding balanced budget amendment, maybe getting some kind of deal just under the wire, that the credit agencies may go ahead and downgrade the U.S. anyway, which is one of the concerns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this, and I think that we need to focus on the things we can control.\xc2\xa0 What we can control, what Congress can control is the necessity to take a vote to extend the debt ceiling to ensure that we can pay our bills, pay the bills that have been rung up already in the past, ensure that the United States does not default on its obligations for the first time in its history, and ensure that, as part of this, at the very minimum, we can embed into the law significant spending cuts that will also be positive for the economy and will send a positive signal to investors that we\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to get our fiscal house in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t be everything that we had hoped for.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President is very committed to the biggest deal possible, very committed to a grand bargain, if you will, along the lines of $3 to $4 trillion over 10 years, that would be balanced, that would really solve this problem for an extended period of time and put us on the right path.\xc2\xa0 And he will remain committed to addressing that -- the bigger issues, regardless of the compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s reached in these next several days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we think that if we take the right actions in these next few days and then continue to focus on the need to grapple with entitlement reform and tax reform, and show that we are addressing those issues with real seriousness, that that will send the message that we want to send around the world about Washington getting its act together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot is required to do that.\xc2\xa0 But the first thing that is required is a willingness to accept that no one in this process will get 100 percent of what he wants; that we cannot keep revisiting legislation that everyone knows has no chances of getting out of Congress and getting to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk because it does not enjoy the support of both houses of Congress and members of both parties.\xc2\xa0 We need to find a compromise.\xc2\xa0 And if that will exists, finding it will be quite easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
