EST</p>\n<p>PRESS CORPS:\xc2\xa0 Yay!</p>\n<p>PRESS CORPS:\xc2\xa0 Ohhhh!</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Let me get a few pictures over here.\xc2\xa0 What was that groan for?\xc2\xa0 Come on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Show us again, come one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t go yet, I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a couple of non-serious announcements in my --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What position did Gibbs play, anyway?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is -- I am, first of all, as you can tell, not in my normal attire -- though it does signify Friday here at the White House, casual Friday as we newly instituted.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I am making good on my aspect of my wager with Dimitri, my Canadian counterpart, who is somewhere several hundred miles north laughing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you itching yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not.\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little warm.\xc2\xa0 The number 39 is for Ryan Miller, who of course was the United States goalie and the tournament MVP.\xc2\xa0 I have one official government announcement:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve instructed the embassy, our embassy and our ambassador to make arrangements to deliver one case of Molson Canadian and one case of Yuengling lager from Pottsville, Pennsylvania, America\xe2\x80\x99s oldest brewery, to the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s office today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Dimitri will take most of that home and consume it.</p>\n<p>Let me do the week ahead and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back into more semi-serious attire for the rest of your hockey questions.</p>\n<p>PRESS CORPS:\xc2\xa0 No!</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifteen minutes!</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Fifteen minutes -- I thought we were doing this on the metric scale.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s 30 minutes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifteen Canadian.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Exactly, right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the exchange rate?</p>\n<p>The President has no scheduled public events this weekend.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, as you know, the President will travel to Strongsville, Ohio, where he will deliver remarks on health insurance reform.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday the President will attend meetings here at the White House.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday the President will meet with the Taoiseach of Ireland, Brian Cowen, at the White House.\xc2\xa0 In the evening the President and First Lady will host the Taoiseach and Mrs. Cowen at the annual St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day reception held in the East Room, and the event will be pooled press.</p>\n<p>On Thursday and Friday the President will be here in Washington, D.C. and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to talk, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, about the trip here in a few moments.\xc2\xa0 Let me get a little bit semi-organized.</p>\n<p>I will say -- no offense to my Canadian friends here -- but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done this fully without -- (applause) -- also -- let me put my specs back on -- of course this just has 10 for 2010 on it.\xc2\xa0 Nick and U.S.A. Hockey -- the happy providers of this jersey -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a little smaller in size, which I think Nick did on purpose so that at the conclusion of this I would give the jersey to him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What else are you taking off?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s Rahm, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky you didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a bet about wrestling.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more fashion spin, please.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You like the USA, 2010 USA.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should take any questions wearing this, but -- you know what, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a couple.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Now that the trip has been delayed, how is the President going to use those extra two days?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Phil, the President has met with and talked with, as you know, many members of Congress over the past several days.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that he will talk with the leaders and members of Congress in -- talking to them about the benefits of passing health care reform.\xc2\xa0 So I anticipate that that kind of -- that kind of thing will happen.</p>\n<p>This came about as a result of a conversation that the President had with Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Reid, who --all three agreed that it would be helpful to have a few extra days here, talking to members.\xc2\xa0 But they also agreed that this was an extremely important trip for the United States of America for the President to go to Indonesia and to Australia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Congress is going to be around for a week after the President leaves.\xc2\xa0 So is the 20th now the new 18th?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of deadlines.\xc2\xa0 Is now the 20th now the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m simply going to say the President, as we announced today, will leave for the trip at 10:00 a.m. on the 21st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is okay with Congress continuing discussions of health care, even while he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling, or does he want this all wrapped up with a bow by the 20th?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 I think the President wants, members of Congress want a vote as soon as possible that will lead to improved health care for millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President expect to leave having the House pass --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I will leave deadlines up to the Speaker.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President fails -- if Congress fails to get this across the finish line or very close to it before next Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled -- rescheduled departure date for Asia, is there a chance that this trip could be delayed again or even canceled altogether?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In speaking with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, all three agreed this was an important trip for the President to make.</p>\n<p>The Asia-Pacific region of the world is tremendously important to the United States for a number of reasons.\xc2\xa0 We will -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to visit, obviously, Indonesia, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Muslim population, an emerging democracy.\xc2\xa0 The President will follow up on his speech from Cairo in a speech in Indonesia -- a key partner, obviously in our counterterrorism efforts -- before traveling to Australia, obviously a very important trading partner and an important ally in our efforts in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>I will say that if you -- as the President said in Tokyo, that for years the United States has been absent from the Asia-Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 We are -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t lead in this region of the world without strong bilateral relationships with Indonesia and Australia.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re key in our ability to keep our country safe.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re key in our ability to grow our economy through increased exports.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re key to tackling big challenges.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia is the fourth-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99ll be incredibly important to international agreements on climate change.</p>\n<p>So the President believed it was important to give the issue of health care and the effort to get votes on health care a few more days, but also believes, as do those leaders in Congress, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep this trip on our schedule with two important partners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other issue.\xc2\xa0 The President looks to be homing in on his Fed nominees.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that Janet Yellen is the leading candidate for nominee as vice chairman, and that Sarah Raskin and Peter Diamond are under consideration for other vacancies?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any kind of sense of the timing, whether he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make an announcement before the trip, after the trip?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we -- she is obviously somebody who -- a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; somebody with great expertise in macroeconomic issues; the current president of the Fed in San Francisco.\xc2\xa0 And she is a leading contender for the vice chair nomination.</p>\n<p>As you know, we are hoping to fill the vacancy of the vice chair in time for the end of the current term, which is June.\xc2\xa0 And I would say Sarah Raskin and Peter Diamond are also under strong consideration for additional vacancies.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timing announcement, though, on any of those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we speaking a matter of weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on when the timing would be, except obviously for Janet Yellen, who\xe2\x80\x99s under strong consideration, I would say anybody that is appointed to the vice chair would need to be done -- our hope obviously, as I said, is to get it done before the current term expires.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And she is the leading candidate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say she is a leading contender, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A leading contender?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has it been 15 minutes yet?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to put your jacket on?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you feel uncomfortable, Jake?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I feel like if I show this to the viewers of ABC News, World News --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then we have to explain the whole thing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a little confused why on a story about health care you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing a hockey jersey.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t be any stranger than some of the other stuff I see on the news, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what -- somebody give Jake the Canadian one and we\xe2\x80\x99ll just do a quick two-shot and we\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Faceoff. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Would you feel more comfortable if I switched?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad it was a hockey, not a wrestling, bet.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or sumo wrestling.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say something, but I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Say happy birthday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 True.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other than talking to members of Congress, what is so important that the President needs to be here for those extra two days?\xc2\xa0 I understand that the members of Congress were asking President Obama to do this, that you\xe2\x80\x99re not imposing his presence, but what can he -- what difference will it make?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Jake, I think the President will use the time, as I said earlier, to speak either individually with or in small groups with members that may be at this point undecided on how they\xe2\x80\x99ll vote.\xc2\xa0 The President I think will take the opportunity to once again reiterate his case for why this reform is so important, why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to do this now, why it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to stop or to start over, why we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with dramatic spikes in health insurance right now, and why we have to deal with this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think so many members -- I mean, 216 members of the House who voted for it in November, voted for the House bill, are still there -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s a majority.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think so many of them are having second thoughts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I think some of them are likely waiting for finished CBO scoring.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a natural thing to wait for and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to evaluate that scoring and to evaluate the legislation in full.</p>\n<p>But, again, I think the President believes that he can make a very strong case for why this is important to do right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, lastly, as you know, a lot of House Democrats are distrustful of the Senate -- of Senate Democrats, and they\xe2\x80\x99re worried that with the way the parliamentarian has ruled they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be tricked somehow into passing the Senate bill and then the fixes to the Senate bill, and the Senate won\xe2\x80\x99t pass the fixes and they will have been tricked into passing the Senate bill that a lot of them don\xe2\x80\x99t like without those fixes.</p>\n<p>Is President Obama reassuring them, telling these House Democrats that if the reconciliation, if the fix doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass the Senate bill in itself, he won\xe2\x80\x99t sign that bill?\xc2\xa0 Or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again -- and I mentioned some of this yesterday -- I think some of this -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wade into the parliamentary politics on Capitol Hill, except to say this, the President is talking with -- not just with members of the House on the vote that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make, but also with members of the Senate to ensure that the corrections that the President sees as so important -- not just the House, but the President sees as so important -- are also acted on.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a dual track.\xc2\xa0 It works together, but the President is working on both of those issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think -- will -- is it possible, in any way you look at it, that one would happen -- that the Senate bill would pass but the fixes would not, and the Senate bill would become law?\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what House members are worried about.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is spending time also dealing with senators to ensure that they are supportive of those legislative fixes on their side of it, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Representative Dreier, in referring to the President\xe2\x80\x99s delay, said today, \xe2\x80\x9cWe know that they are doing everything within their power to try and twist arms and encourage people to vote for something that is extraordinarily unpopular and I believe would be devastating for our nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What do you say to Americans who are still having a difficult time buying the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Like Mr. Dreier?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Dreier and others.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would probably tell Mr. Dreier the same thing Mr. Dreier from California.\xc2\xa0 People in his state are getting the letters that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here for the past several weeks; the letters that say, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99ve paid your premiums, I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten sick, but you\xe2\x80\x99re in the individual health insurance market, and your health insurance rates are going up 39 percent next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to take on.</p>\n<p>We have to provide the ability for a small business in the state of California and throughout this country, or in Mr. Dreier\xe2\x80\x99s district, or a family that\xe2\x80\x99s struggling with the high cost of health care, to get them some help.</p>\n<p>The President is doing this because he believes that this is the right thing to do for our country -- to have a health care and health insurance network that works not just for health insurance companies but works for average, everyday working Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he continues to pursue this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99ll see it to passage soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it frustrate the President at all that he\xe2\x80\x99s been making this big push, pointing out what the insurance industry has been doing with the premium hikes -- does it frustrate him that the message still isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting through to some?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the message -- I think the President is -- I think the President feels some momentum on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that while many thought this issue was going to go away or was dead a few weeks ago has gotten new life, I think largely because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen insurers send out the letters that I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the AfPak meeting, can you tell us more about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me give you a quick readout, and then we can go through a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 The President met with his national security team as part of the regular updates that he receives on Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 This was part of the monthly video teleconferencing.\xc2\xa0 The next one I believe is scheduled for April 16th.\xc2\xa0 The meeting began with a briefing from General McChrystal, who noted a continued progress in the Marja offensive and the strengthening partnership with Afghan national security forces.</p>\n<p>The President and his team discussed a range of issues related to security and governance.\xc2\xa0 The President also received a briefing from Ambassador Patterson, our ambassador in Islamabad, on our security cooperation with Pakistan and support for the Pakistani people.</p>\n<p>Of note that General McChrystal told the group, including obviously the President, that we were on schedule on our force flow in getting additional forces approved by the President into Afghanistan by the end of the summer.\xc2\xa0 They discussed in surrounding Marja that we were largely through the clearing phase and more rapidly moving to a phase of hold, which puts a premium obviously on good governance.\xc2\xa0 And we spent quite a bit of time discussing the Afghan national security forces, the army and the police forces, the training and some adjustments that the President and the team have been working on around recruitment and retention of police and army forces dating back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s original meetings in the Situation Room prior to his decision in December.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick thing.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration pleased with the Pakistani government in the effort fighting terrorism, or does Pakistan need to do more?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have had -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed I think a almost unprecedented level of cooperation with them, dating back probably almost a year now, to extremist movements that threatened the Pakistanis and I think in many ways alerted them to many of the concerns that we had long had.\xc2\xa0 We feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress each and every day, and I think in the update that he got from Ambassador Patterson that was conveyed.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President is aware that it\xe2\x80\x99s against international law to annex occupied land.\xc2\xa0 Why do we keep giving, as Vice President Biden did, iron-clad commitments to Israel when it violates international law?\xc2\xa0 And the President says that our relationship is unshakeable.\xc2\xa0 How can that be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we enjoy a strong and important relationship with the country and the people of Israel.\xc2\xa0 And we are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even when it violates the law?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you go into this whole thing -- why should they be -- get this reprieve?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we enjoy a strong relationship with the country and the people.\xc2\xa0 We are committed to their security in a very important and dangerous --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the Palestinian security?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me finish my answer, Helen -- in a very important region of the world.\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President, though, could not have been clearer on, as I said and as the Vice President said, on both the timing and the substance of the announcement that was made during his trip, that we have asked each side to refrain from the type of announcements that would shake the trust needed to sit down together and make some decisions on moving forward on a peace process.</p>\n<p>So I think the Vice President was extremely clear on his trip there.\xc2\xa0 I know the President looks forward to speaking with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll get back very, very early tomorrow morning, and I anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll either -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll likely talk either later in the weekend or first thing on Monday about what the Vice President saw, not just in Israel but in the region, as we try to move things forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the violation on the part of one party.\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. going to do about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that the Vice President was extremely strong in condemning what the Israeli government announced during his trip.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the President is feeling some momentum on health care.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Weiner, who has long been urging the President to be more involved, said that as a result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s recent increased involvement, there is now a tidal change in the last 72 hours up there.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that the change has been that great in degree?\xc2\xa0 And if so, was it because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s uptick in involvement?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he do it sooner?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I probably said this a thousand times, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll add another one to it.\xc2\xa0 I doubt the President -- I doubt we\xe2\x80\x99d be where we are on health care, after this long, if the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t personally invested in, from the very beginning, on getting this done.</p>\n<p>I think, Chip, as the President said at the State of the Union, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear, by some of the polling numbers, we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing this out of -- for sheer political benefit.\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to -- you can swing a cat in this town and hit somebody that believes that the President should just give this up for political considerations.</p>\n<p>The President, I think, has been pretty clear about why he\xe2\x80\x99s made decisions during his time as President -- not because they\xe2\x80\x99re easy, not because they\xe2\x80\x99re in the next day\xe2\x80\x99s political interests, but because they\xe2\x80\x99re the right thing for the country.</p>\n<p>So I think what has provided health care with the most momentum, quite honestly, in the past several weeks, are the insurance company rate increases.\xc2\xa0 I think they have crystallized for many across the country what happens.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen report after report from Wall Street about what happens if reform fails.\xc2\xa0 They all agree that insurance companies, like the ones that raise rates, are likely to be the big winners out of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in delaying the trip, to what degree was that because of pressure from Democrats in Congress?\xc2\xa0 And did he -- did Nancy Pelosi specifically ask him to do this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President talked to the Speaker and the Majority Leader.\xc2\xa0 They discussed what would be most beneficial for this process, and agreed together to move the trip back a few days.\xc2\xa0 But the President and, as I said earlier, the Majority Leader and the Speaker believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the President go on this trip.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a very important region of the world.\xc2\xa0 If we don\xe2\x80\x99t help lead in this region of the world, other people will.\xc2\xa0 It is in our national interest to have strong bilateral relationships with emerging democracies like Indonesia and important partners like Australia.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some people say, you know, well, why does the President have to do this, because there\xe2\x80\x99s not some big multilateral conference that he\xe2\x80\x99s attending, or this -- as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re at -- we have long -- long ago have been -- for quite some time we\xe2\x80\x99ve been absent from, again, this important region of the world.\xc2\xa0 We have important partnerships that lead to increasing our security, increasing our economic growth, and increasing the likelihood that we deal with important problems in having strong bilateral relationships with places like Indonesia and Australia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the central reason that the three of them decided that delaying the trip was the thing to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To give a little bit more time to get health care done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 You had said earlier in the week that the President was not calling individual members yet but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He had not at that point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, he has now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has -- I mean, obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to -- he\xe2\x80\x99s had meetings with.\xc2\xa0 There have been other events that individuals have been here for.\xc2\xa0 I know obviously on Monday he had talked to members who had visited for, like, a PAYGO reception or things like that.\xc2\xa0 He has made individual calls now and I anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he spending most of his day or a good portion of his day doing that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spending part of his day.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, he spent -- the Afghanistan meeting, Afghanistan/Pakistan update was scheduled for 60 minutes and the meeting went 90 today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance we could get a call list of who he\xe2\x80\x99s called?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not likely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the President is leaving at 10:00 a.m. Sunday --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s 10:00 a.m., yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the 21st, regardless of whether the House has voted or not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is going on a trip on the 21st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regardless of whether the House has voted or not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is going on the 21st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You announced on Twitter this morning that -- this development and that the First Family would not be joining him.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you shed any light on why that particular decision was made?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Scheduling-wise, the way now the trip sits in the week is not as good for two young girls who have to go back to school at the conclusion of that trip.\xc2\xa0 I will say this:\xc2\xa0 This was -- and I should have said this yesterday, Chip, to your question -- even under the old itinerary, the President was not scheduled to stop at the house that he spent time in when he lived in Indonesia, nor was he scheduled to go to the school that he attended.\xc2\xa0 So I should have said that yesterday in answer to your question.\xc2\xa0 But the way now the trip sits in the week, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as conducive for them to go.\xc2\xa0 And I will say when you get your renewed itinerary, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it\xe2\x80\x99s a brisk trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Members of the House who met with the President last week said that he told them that success on other high-priority pieces of legislation is predicated on success on health care -- energy, immigration.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that he will have a diminished chance of passing other items this year if health care is not passed in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken directly with the President about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard members say.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- leaving aside what it does for any other issue, as I said earlier I think the President believes strongly in the desire to see progress on an issue that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about for decades, to do something positive on behalf of those that are struggling with high costs, and dealing with insurance companies on preexisting conditions, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get something done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, the immigration groups, the leaders that were out in the driveway yesterday, said that they pressed the President for a bill in the Senate by the end of April.\xc2\xa0 Does the President want a bill in the Senate by the end of April?\xc2\xa0 Does he buy into that deadline?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say that in addition to meeting with activists, in addition to meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as you know, the President met yesterday with Senators Schumer and Graham, pleased to get an update on their progress in forging a proposal to fix our immigration system.</p>\n<p>The President -- they asked the President and he agreed to review their framework, and we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of doing that now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on Mike?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it more important for the girls to go to this trip and miss a few days of school, despite how brisk the trip is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision I would leave to the parents, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- having a six-year-old, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that they also spend some time -- Lord knows we\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough snow days -- they spend some time in school.</p>\n<p>But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s way above -- that is above my pay grade by many, many rungs on the ladder.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by the way, that phrase \xe2\x80\x9cswing a cat,\xe2\x80\x9d if you swing most cats, you get scratched, you know.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I may do that right up here with the front row.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a little warm so I may change here in a second.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking ahead to this Ohio stuff on Monday, is there going to be a retooled message?\xc2\xa0 Will there be a -- like, more of a sense of urgency in the closing days?\xc2\xa0 What can we look for there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President -- I think the President will spend time hitting a lot of the themes that he hit on Wednesday and on last Monday:\xc2\xa0 going through why reform is important; going through what it will do the minute he signs the legislation on behalf of millions of Americans; discussing what happens, again, if we decide now is not the time.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate again what I said earlier, in the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this not because it\xe2\x80\x99s easy; we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this not because the President is concerned about or looking to the next election, but looking to the next generation.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate that it\xe2\x80\x99s the important thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One housekeeping question.\xc2\xa0 As Mike mentioned, you made this trip announcement on Twitter this morning.\xc2\xa0 It still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown up on any of our usual vehicles through your office officially.\xc2\xa0 Is Twitter now going to become your vehicle of choice to tell us major things --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Part of the reason -- part of the reason I did that, I bet some of you got emails that I sent you several hours after I actually sent them to you because there were some email issues here at the White House and we felt like it was important to get a confirmation of that out.</p>\n<p>I would say Twitter is a quick medium to get information out, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably use it more often.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know, there are about 20 or 25 other Robert Gibbses on Twitter -- (laughter) -- some of them who deign to use your picture -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why -- (laughter) -- or the presidential seal or the podium.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that one of these guys is going to hijack your message and, you know, maybe burn you at some point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, I mean, again, I think if you go to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many Robert Gibbs there are, but if you go to @presssec, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that there is a verification for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is, indeed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So obviously --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several of them use that -- use a formulation with \xe2\x80\x9cpresssec\xe2\x80\x9d in it, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re very funny.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think some of them are quite humorous.\xc2\xa0 I would, again, look for the verification, and of course we only make big announcements in hockey jerseys.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d say look for that.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Fed announcements, you mentioned there are three that are leading contenders.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean there are lagging contenders?\xc2\xa0 How big is the pool?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into characterizing.\xc2\xa0 I would just -- I put a few monikers on those names to describe where they are in the process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are other names in the process?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are other names, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what does it mean to be a leading indicator?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean they --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A leading contender.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A leading contender.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It means you\xe2\x80\x99ve done well in your weight class, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done -- no.\xc2\xa0 I would say -- I would put those at the top of the President\xe2\x80\x99s list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they spoken to the President?\xc2\xa0 Has the President offered them the job?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When we have official announcements, we\xe2\x80\x99ll put them on Twitter.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joking.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joking.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joking.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joking.\xc2\xa0 Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing a hockey jersey, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it makes it funnier, I guess.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say, Robert, that next Thursday and Friday the President will devote almost all of his attention to dealing with health care -- the votes and the pending conversations he may be needing to have with House Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll dedicate a good -- a portion of his day -- look, understanding that the -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a shortage of things that we could spend time with the President on that are very pressing.\xc2\xa0 The President starts -- generally starts each day with a daily intelligence briefing; almost always has an economic daily briefing; a series of meetings with senior advisors.</p>\n<p>Again, I assume he\xe2\x80\x99ll spend certainly a portion of his day dealing with the issues of health care, but I have no doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll put on additional meetings on other topics that are of importance, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re the economy or whether they\xe2\x80\x99re national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the meeting yesterday, Senator Graham represented afterwards that he told the President face to face that if reconciliation is used for health care in the Senate, that will kill any hope of putting immigration on the agenda as a doable item for the remainder of this legislative session.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him directly about that statement.\xc2\xa0 I doubt the President would have agreed with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in this instance and about this issue before, reconciliation is something that has -- is a legislative tool that\xe2\x80\x99s been used on many, many occasions, particularly as it relates to things like health care.\xc2\xa0 And we talked about the fact that the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program was done through reconciliation; the COBRA program was done through reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Senator Graham believed that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would it be the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective that that would be an alarmist --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, hold on, let me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that --\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Senator Graham thought that it would do damage to the legislative priorities of a President when in 2001 and in 2003 tax cuts went through reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it except to say I doubt the President agrees with it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One issue that\xe2\x80\x99s come up for Luis Gutierrez, who I believe attended the meeting with the President yesterday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of the -- we had a list of -- I think we put out a list of invitees.\xc2\xa0 I do not know who was there.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check and see if Representative Gutierrez was there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One issue he raised today -- he still remains concerned, and he was when he voted for the House bill, about restrictions in the Senate bill, which of course is the underlying legislation, and there are no known fixes being proposed on immigration that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of -- please tell me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong -- that the Senate language is simply too restrictive and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow undocumented workers, even with their own money, to purchase in the health exchange system, and would keep them -- prevent them from doing that for five years.\xc2\xa0 He now says publicly he will vote no.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern to the White House?\xc2\xa0 Is there something that the White House is open to in dealing with that issue in fixing the legislation?\xc2\xa0 Or is that something that needs to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with Legislative Affairs.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which -- I was not in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting so I can certainly try to check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, yesterday you said some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s big priorities after health care are financial regulatory reform and the Citizens United case.\xc2\xa0 What did you mean by that?\xc2\xa0 In other words, what can you do specifically about that ruling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the legislation right now with Senator Schumer and Congressman Van Hollen that would address some of the things that were opened up as a result of that Supreme Court ruling.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly looked at that legislation, and I think counsel and others are evaluating that and other vehicles in order to address -- to address what the Supreme Court opened up in their ruling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question while you have the USA sweater on there.\xc2\xa0 I draw your attention to a Web site that\xe2\x80\x99s posted a letter to \xe2\x80\x9cBarack the Red\xe2\x80\x9d -- not what you think it means.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do I need to get my Canadian jersey back?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 They write, \xe2\x80\x9cThese are trying times.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment is in double digits \xe2\x80\xa6 Audacity?\xc2\xa0 Check out number eight, Alexander Ovechkin.\xc2\xa0 Hope?\xc2\xa0 This season has found the Capitals with better postseason prospects than any other year.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They plaintively write at the end here, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Capitals bandwagon is filling up quickly, but we need a leader.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Will the President commit to going to a Washington Capitals game this season?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be his first hockey game ever, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say -- no, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll check and see if he\xe2\x80\x99s been to a game in Chicago or not -- less so in Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 I will check on whether he\xe2\x80\x99s been to a game before.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that before March 18th, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got a couple extra days now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Come on, guys.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Friday, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Look, I think he would very much enjoy going.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the last time he ventured out to a sporting event, Georgetown looked like they did yesterday, not like they did in the previous several weeks.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I know he enjoys going out there.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten invitations from the owner to go.\xc2\xa0 And I know he\xe2\x80\x99d be -- he can borrow my jersey.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wanted to ask you about the Afghanistan meeting today.\xc2\xa0 Did the issue of reconciliation -- not health care -- (laughter) -- but the reconciliation with the Taliban come up?\xc2\xa0 Officials have said in the past that they think that the U.S. should only do that from a position of strength.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, Helene, I left with about two or three minutes to go in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 They were just getting to -- or I should I say I left when I thought two or three minutes were left in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I will find out if there were additional conversations.\xc2\xa0 This was something the President was bringing up as I left the meeting after about an hour and a half.\xc2\xa0 So let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any additional information on that.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 First, last week both major parties chose candidates for the western Pennsylvania seat of the late John Murtha.\xc2\xa0 The President campaigned for Bill Owens in New York last year and for Ms. Coakley in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to campaign for Mr. Critz?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling information on that, and I can certainly check with Political Affairs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing:\xc2\xa0 Do you have an answer yet on Mr. Sestak\xe2\x80\x99s charge?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on that.</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert -- thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 When all is said and done, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it really more for image that the President -- are you going to take off your --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting a little warm in here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looks pretty good.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\xc2\xa0 I can do two things at once, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 When all is said and done, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it really a good argument that the President is going to go to -- going to postpone his trip really for image and not really for substance?\xc2\xa0 You said before that he does have a telephone -- a cell phone on the plane; he\xe2\x80\x99s in touch with everybody; he could do it here.\xc2\xa0 But, frankly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of heat I think being generated that he\xe2\x80\x99s away from maybe some people think he should be here.\xc2\xa0 So how do you respond to those kinds of concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go at all?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, not that -- yes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made the point it\xe2\x80\x99s a good trip.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s an important trip; right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An important trip.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m failing to understand -- give me the first part of your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is now not going -- now postponing his trip.\xc2\xa0 Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the argument be made that it\xe2\x80\x99s more for image, that he really can do everything, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, on the trip that he can do here, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s reversing course?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- look, I -- as I said, certainly the plane comes, in many ways regrettably, with all that equipment that would allow him to be in touch.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody believed that him being here was more important.</p>\n<p>The trip -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t postpone the trip for any image sake.\xc2\xa0 I think the -- in the discussion that the President had with the Speaker and the Majority Leader in the Senate, it was agreed upon that, quite frankly, we could do -- we could give a few extra days here to what they needed as well as keep -- and I will say our scheduling guys have done a heroic job of keeping the trip intact in an important region of the world.</p>\n<p>So this is not done for anything other than a few extra days to work on getting health care reform through the process, as well as keeping that important trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he got a few people that he\xe2\x80\x99s specifically earmarking to talk to that he thinks might be able to change their minds, those who voted for and now might vote against, or people he thinks he might be able to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, without getting into a lot of names, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen folks that have said they want to take a look at what the new legislation is.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think people are rightly waiting for an evaluation from CBO as a way of answering some of the questions that they have.\xc2\xa0 I think the President certainly will talk to people about, again, why he thinks the bill is important and why he thinks it does so many good things on cost and things like that.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On immigration reform, will the President work to round up more Republican co-sponsors for the bill that Schumer and Graham are working on?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me not get ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation process of the framework that they walked him through some yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, do you expect that the President may give a public statement or a speech of any kind on immigration, maybe before the rally in Washington on the 21st?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with scheduling.\xc2\xa0 I know the -- look, I will say this, I know the President committed to Senators Schumer and Graham, to the Hispanic Caucus, and to activists, as I think you read in his statement yesterday, the importance of and his strong belief in getting comprehensive reform done.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a supporter of that, and obviously it is our strong hope that we can make progress on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s talk on the Hill about putting the President\xe2\x80\x99s student loan proposal into the health care bill.\xc2\xa0 What does that have to do with health care, and why would that go in there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any final decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0 Obviously one way of getting important reforms through the legislative process would be in this vehicle.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- these are reforms that are good for students; they\xe2\x80\x99re really good for taxpayers; they\xe2\x80\x99re bad for special interests.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any final decisions have been made on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I would point you up there.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is a strong believer in a reform system that would cut out the middleman on borrowing money for millions of kids to go to college.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it because -- I mean, but it also would save money.\xc2\xa0 Is it because it would bring down the overall cost of the package, including the health care part?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I know this is an important reform for the President.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan and the meeting this morning, as General McChrystal -- is he satisfied with the NATO involvement in the Marja offensive -- the British and the Canadians were involved.\xc2\xa0 And knowing that NATO hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able yet to reach the goal of several thousand NATO soldiers on the ground, has the President or does the President intend to reach to NATO leaders, and the Canadian Prime Minister in particular, on this topic?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 NATO came up in the sense of discussing their contributions and in walking through the commitment that we need, quite honestly, from all of our partners, particularly in the realm of training.\xc2\xa0 We did not discuss in the meeting any additional steps that the President might take.</p>\n<p>Again, the President and many on the team understand the importance of what we have to do in -- not just in force contributions.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, General McChrystal believed that the pace of force flow from what the President had asked for was on schedule.\xc2\xa0 But we have critical improvements that have to be made as it relates to an Afghan national army and critical improvements that have to be made in an Afghan national police and the importance of getting additional trainers from NATO countries to Afghanistan as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>We are -- in these meetings, the President has gone through and looked at monthly recruitment and retention goals because at some point we\xe2\x80\x99re going -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be there forever.\xc2\xa0 And the Afghan national army -- and in many districts not only are we going to need improved governance but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a police force that can keep the peace.</p>\n<p>So that came up, but there were no -- there was no discussion of additional calls by the President.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Oh, Stephen, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I thought you had some.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, just on that subject, will the President perhaps make a new request to Australia during his trip for more help in Afghanistan for perhaps trainers rather than combat troops?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 That was not discussed.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the issue of the public option, now that it\xe2\x80\x99s off of life support and it\xe2\x80\x99s now one of the casualties of the fight for health care reform, is the President looking at passage and then possibly going back after the passage to tweak it?\xc2\xa0 And the reason why I ask that -- some members of the Congressional Black Caucus who were for the public option and now are saying, okay, there have problems before when we passed something and we\xe2\x80\x99ve come back to tweak it, like on Medicare, Social Security.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s mindset as well, and did he talk to them about that?\xc2\xa0 Did they have that kind of discussion yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with folks that -- I was not in that meeting because that was taking place during my briefing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that was something that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 I know that the -- again, the President is focused on the legislation that we have at hand and in trying to get that through and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking down at the road at re-tweaks.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s just looking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t re-tweak anything that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get passed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what our focus is at the moment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, as you know, you had a little bit of a hiccup there at the end with the confirmation of Ben Bernanke at the Fed.\xc2\xa0 Neither one of these three potential appointees seem to have a lot of small business experience; they\xe2\x80\x99re fairly mainstream folks from the financial world.\xc2\xa0 Five senators have just put out a letter to the President requesting that these three appointees have real-world experience, experience with the middle class and small business owners.\xc2\xa0 Do these three folks have that kind of experience, and how do you respond to those concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at the letter.\xc2\xa0 I think that these are strong contenders.\xc2\xa0 They have strong credentials.\xc2\xa0 They have good experience.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at the letter and maybe have a better comment on it then.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boehner and McConnell have put out their names for the deficit commission.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to those names?\xc2\xa0 And when do you hope that commission gets up and working?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a positive development for the commission that while there was some concern about whether Republicans would put forward names they now have, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important and a positive development, we think and hope that the rest of those names will be coming forward soon.</p>\n<p>Look, I think the President believes that this is an important -- an important commission to look at all of the aspects of what this government spends money on and to evaluate its sustainability in the future.</p>\n<p>Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ve got many -- many of those choices have put forward, in the case of Congressman Ryan or in others, their own plans in the past, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will -- that will govern many of the recommendations and advice that some of those members have.\xc2\xa0 Again, our strong hope is that in the next few weeks, not only will the commission be filled out but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have staff in place and that the commission can meet soon in order to generate recommendations, hopefully that Congress can act on quickly.</p>\n<p>Ken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, my understanding is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to start marking up the reconciliation bill at the same time that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be dealing with trying to get the Senate bill passed.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House role in that?\xc2\xa0 And also, won\xe2\x80\x99t that be a little bit confusing to be working on sort of two tracks of health care at once?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, look, I think the -- obviously the House will take up the measure.\xc2\xa0 The Budget Committee has to take up in the House reconciliation, begin that process.\xc2\xa0 I think the Speaker has said that that will be posted on the Internet for some period of time.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be confusing because I do think that, at this point, people understand that this is a -- this is a two-step process that has to get done before we can wrap health care up altogether.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:03 P.M.
