EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One en route back to Washington, back from Miami where the President had a really worthwhile day touring the National Hurricane Center, discussing climate change, and then as you saw, spending a few minutes online, on Twitter, taking questions.\xc2\xa0 The President very much enjoyed that activity this afternoon, and then stopping by the shrine on the way to the airport.\xc2\xa0 But with that, I will take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Cuba -- tomorrow is the day that Cuba is supposed to be released from the state sponsors of terrorism list.\xc2\xa0 How close are the U.S. and Cuba to announcing that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be opening -- or reopening embassies in each other\xe2\x80\x99s countries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, our two governments continue to discuss the reestablishment of diplomatic relations and opening embassies in Havana, including different matters that relate to how our embassies will operate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, there was a round of talks last week at the State Department, led by Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Roberta Jacobson.\xc2\xa0 The State Department released that those talks were productive.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any definitive announcements for you at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that one of the sticking points has been the issue of how freely U.S. diplomats can roam around Cuba and who they can talk to.\xc2\xa0 Will the U.S. accept anything less than 100 percent for them to be able to go wherever they want and talk to whoever they want to?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, I\'m not immersed in the details of those discussions, so I\'m not going to be in a position to negotiate with you.\xc2\xa0 Right now I will say that we feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress in the last five months, and we\xe2\x80\x99re much closer to reestablishing relations and reopening embassies.\xc2\xa0 These are the first steps in the long process of normalizing the relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s going to allow us to represent better U.S. interests and increased engagement with the Cuban people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, the President feels strongly that after 55 years of a policy that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working, reestablishing normal relations is not only in the interest of the American people, but also the Cuban people as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, I want to follow up on the FIFA decision from yesterday; there\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit of time.\xc2\xa0 Since that came out, does the President now have a reaction to it?\xc2\xa0 And maybe more specifically, does he have -- or the White House have any feeling on whether or not the head of the organization should step down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more of a presidential reaction to readout to you, and the reason for that is pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing case, an ongoing investigation at Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So we take great pains to not only make sure that we do not interfere with an ongoing investigation, or that our comments aren\xe2\x80\x99t misinterpreted as appearing to interfere.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have much for you from the White House on this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the President of Russia sort of suggesting that this prosecution of FIFA is somehow an attempt to take the World Cup away from Russia in 2018?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House want to respond to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I did see some press reports on that, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 All I would say is that we have total and complete confidence in the prosecutors at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, this was a complicated case that took quite a while to prepare, and so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave it to them to prosecute it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the immigration decision, it looks like timing wise it\'s going to be the summer of next year before this situation is resolved.\xc2\xa0 Does the President regret waiting so long to actually put in place the executive actions?\xc2\xa0 You know he delayed the decision until after the elections, and now it looks like the situation is not going to be resolved until he\xe2\x80\x99s almost out of office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take a few steps back on that.\xc2\xa0 First, a lot of what the President has done on this front is already being implemented.\xc2\xa0 So if you look at what the court ruled in that Fifth Circuit, we understand that the deferred action guidelines announced last November have been put on hold.\xc2\xa0 But everyone should be aware that the existing 2012 policy that provides deferred action to certain DREAMers is still in place.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement priorities, including our focus on deporting felons and not families, and many other executive actions on immigration continue to move forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe do want the courts to move expeditiously through this.\xc2\xa0 We feel strongly that we are on solid legal ground.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve explained that a multitude of times.\xc2\xa0 And what guides our legal strategy is that -- unfortunately, the litigation has created a great deal of uncertainty for people who would have been able to seek relief under these new deferred action policies.\xc2\xa0 And so with that in mind, we\xe2\x80\x99re proceeding in a way that provides clarity for them, gives us the best chance of success, and puts on a sustainable path to implementing the President\xe2\x80\x99s common-sense policies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to people who would normally be applying for this program, but now they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from Republican candidates that as soon as they get into office they\xe2\x80\x99re going to restrict this executive action, and right now it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the courts until we\xe2\x80\x99re really close to the next election?\xc2\xa0 What do you say to people who are afraid of putting their names out there and potentially becoming targets for deportation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 First, it would be a shame if an issue so critical like this became mired in a political dispute.\xc2\xa0 But to your point, that is the reason why we want the courts to move expeditiously through this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s an important hearing on July *10th 6th, where the government will make the case on the underlying merits.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On FIFA, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try again.\xc2\xa0 Did the President follow up the investigation with the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch?\xc2\xa0 Did he speak to her about it?\xc2\xa0 Even if you cannot comment on the ongoing investigation, was he aware of what was going on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Laura, I don\xe2\x80\x99t unfortunately have any conversations to read out to you between the President and the Attorney General on this.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say he is aware of what was announced a few days ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he concerned about the allegations regarding Qatar?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have not spoken with him about the details of the allegations contained in the suit that was brought.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any updates on the Patriot Act and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Congress?\xc2\xa0 Any phone calls the President has been making while he\xe2\x80\x99s been in Miami the last two days?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kimberly, as you know, this has been on the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind not just in the past few days or weeks, or even months, but dating back to last January, where he made clear that he wanted to take into account the concerns of a lot of civil libertarians and privacy concerns, and make sure that our intelligence community had the tools they needed to investigate and prosecute terrorists, but while still protecting those concerns.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why his national security team worked closely on legislation called the USA Freedom Act, which passed the House of Representatives by 338 votes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s 338 Democrats and Republicans coming together to pass a significant and complicated piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the piece of legislation he feels should pass the Senate without delay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Eric, without commenting on the investigation -- back to FIFA -- but does the President believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for fresh faces at FIFA, or at least that the elections should be postponed for now given all the investigation going on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken with him about the leadership at FIFA.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On NSA, just to go back, you said the President is engaged and is watching what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, but what actually is he doing in terms of trying to get this passed before the deadline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Toluse, one of the things he did was deploy our national security team to work with House and Senate Republican and Democratic leadership, and specifically the committee chairs tasked with this, to make sure they understood how valuable this program was to our intelligence community, and also how we could make changes and reforms to it to take into account the concerns raised by civil libertarians.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s number one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber two, I think everybody on the Hill is crystal clear on, A, how important this is to the intelligence community, and, B, what the deadline was.\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a deadline that should have snuck up on anyone.\xc2\xa0 This is a deadline that\xe2\x80\x99s been known for a very long time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning, the President went to see the family of a journalist who was killed by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 How was this meeting and how did it happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Laura, thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 This was a private session at the hotel this morning before the President left for the National Hurricane Center.\xc2\xa0 We put out a very brief readout, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to add.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update on the actual review of the hostage policy?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been almost a year since that review was put underway, and there are still questions about what the U.S. government should be doing with hostages and their families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 You are right that that review continues in earnest.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been consulting with a number of folks, both sort of experts and scholars, national security experts and, yes, the families of previously held hostages.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that review.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s principally focused on our communications with the families and how we can better streamline that process.\xc2\xa0 I know that one of the ideas that\xe2\x80\x99s been floated is what some are calling a fusion cell, to make sure that communications with the family is streamlined and they\xe2\x80\x99re not getting any mixed messages from different entities within the federal government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since there were actually arguments in court today over the House lawsuit on the health care law, did you have anything to add on that?\xc2\xa0 When we asked about it yesterday, there had been no arguments yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, yes, thank you for asking.\xc2\xa0 Because this is the kind of litigation from House Republicans that does nothing to solve any of the problems facing the American people.\xc2\xa0 I believe the last thing the American people want is to relive the political disputes over the Affordable Care Act that weren\xe2\x80\x99t just from months -- weeks or months ago, but from literally years ago.\xc2\xa0 And we are much more focused on actually implementing the law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve now made sure that over 16 million Americans are benefitting from the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 We know that House Republicans have been engaged in a systematic repeal effort, voting to repeal the bill over 50 times, and, failing to do so, now resorting to the courts.\xc2\xa0 We find that unfortunate and a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that Sunnis fleeing from Ramadi have been turned back or blocked as they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone into Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any concerns about that?\xc2\xa0 You all have talked about the government of Iraq governing in a multi-sectarian way, but it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s some questions about that as Sunnis are being turned away as they head towards predominantly Shia Baghdad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Toluse, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for any take on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on on the ground in Baghdad.<br/>\n\tAs you point out, generally speaking, we are encouraged by the Iraqi military forces mobilizing at the order of the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 This is, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve said, an effort to push back to retake Ramadi and other parts of Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re doing this in close coordination with the Popular Mobilization Forces and local the Sunni fighters.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe it is critical that all of Iraqi security forces do so under the command and control of the Iraqi government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 On a completely different topic -- Nebraska.\xc2\xa0 The legislature there voted to end the death penalty, overriding the governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto.\xc2\xa0 Do you, does the President have a comment or reaction on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Toluse, I saw those developments over the past few days.\xc2\xa0 I know that it was unclear whether the Nebraska legislature had the votes to override the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto; clearly, they did.\xc2\xa0 I believe --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, they did.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction from the White House for you.\xc2\xa0 I know that in the past the President has expressed concern about the disparate application of the death penalty, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new position to read out on that right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton was in Florida also today.\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if the President was aware they were going to both be there around the same time.\xc2\xa0 And have the two had any interactions lately?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any new meetings they\xe2\x80\x99ve had, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President was aware of her visits today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGreat.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:16 P.M.
