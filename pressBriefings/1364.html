JANE LUBCHENCO</p>\n<p>12:07 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 This is not my attempt to put more people on stage than are in the audience, but we might well succeed by the time this is over.</p>\n<p>I am going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few remarks on what the President has been working on on the BP oil spill, but I wanted to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got several people here at the briefing to give you an update on where we are.</p>\n<p>Our Homeland Security Secretary will give us an update on the overall situation.\xc2\xa0 Rear Admiral Sally Brice-O\xe2\x80\x99Hara will give us some details on the response on the ground and the water to the spill.\xc2\xa0 Deputy Secretary of the Interior David Hayes will give us an update on the joint investigation and on the pressure on industry to clean up the spill.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar is at the BP command center currently in Houston.</p>\n<p>EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson will give us an update on air monitoring and preparations for the spill reaching the shore.\xc2\xa0 We also have Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Carol Browner here also to answer some questions if need be.</p>\n<p>So let me start with a few words of the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement.\xc2\xa0 The President has been actively following the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, receiving multiple updates, and consulting on the response since the incident occurred.\xc2\xa0 The President started his daily intelligence briefing in the Oval Office this morning with an update, and last night on board Air Force One, on the way back to Washington, the President was briefed on the new information regarding the additional breach.</p>\n<p>The President urged, out of an abundance of caution and mindful of the new information, that we must position resources to continue to aggressively confront this incident.\xc2\xa0 Following that, Rear Admiral Landry announced that while BP is ultimately responsible, the administration will continue to be aggressive in our response, and we will use all available resources, possibly including those at the Department of Defense, to see if there are technologies that might be used that surpass the capabilities of the commercial and private sector.</p>\n<p>Again, in accordance with the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, passed after the Exxon Valdez, BP, as the responsible party, is required to fund the cost of the response and cleanup operations, and they are doing so.</p>\n<p>The President has also asked that Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano, Interior Secretary Salazar, and EPA Administrator Jackson go to the Gulf Coast to ensure that BP and the entire government is doing everything possible to respond to this incident.</p>\n<p>In addition, the President has directed responding agencies to devote every resource to not only respond to this incident but to determine its cause.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, Secretary Napolitano and Secretary Salazar laid out the next steps for that investigation.</p>\n<p>We have a lot of folks up here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of slides that we will put up.\xc2\xa0 This is the satellite picture as of 6:00 a.m. this morning.\xc2\xa0 You see where the BP Deepwater Horizon was and the area that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring.</p>\n<p>So, with that, let me turn this over to Secretary Napolitano.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like today to update you with the latest information about the BP oil spill, the steps BP is taking to minimize the environmental and other risks of this incident.</p>\n<p>Last night BP alerted us to additional oil leaking from their deep underwater well.\xc2\xa0 They are working, with our support, to estimate the size of this breach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As has just been mentioned, the President has urged, out of an abundance of caution and mindful of new and evolving information, that we must position resources to continue to confront this spill.</p>\n<p>That being said, we have been anticipating and planning, and today I will be designating that this is a spill of national significance.\xc2\xa0 What that means is that we can now draw down assets from across the country, other coastal areas, by way of example; that we will have a centralized communications because the spill is now crossing different regions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the command center that we have operational in Robert, Louisiana, we are opening a second command center in Mobile, Alabama, for the BP spill.</p>\n<p>As was mentioned, as well as part of our oversight of the response, I will be going to the Gulf Coast tomorrow along with Secretary Salazar and EPA Administrator Jackson to inspect ongoing operations.\xc2\xa0 We remain focused on continued oversight.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking a very close look at efforts underway, particularly to minimize the environmental risks in the area affected by the leaking oil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with other federal, state and local officials deployed to the area and helping in the response effort, and we will be meeting again with BP officials to discuss cleanup planning and operations.</p>\n<p>As the President and the law have made clear, BP is the responsible party and is required to fund the costs of the response and cleanup operations.\xc2\xa0 But our visit to Louisiana and the affected areas tomorrow will also help inform our investigation into the causes of this explosion which left 11 workers missing, three critically injured in addition to the ongoing oil spill.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a coordinated group of federal partners, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Interior and the EPA, continues to work and oversee BP\xe2\x80\x99s deployment of a combination of tactics above water, below water, dozens of miles offshore, as well as closer to coastal areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, yesterday BP began a controlled burn designed to remove large quantities of oil from the open water in an effort to protect shoreline and marine and other wildlife.\xc2\xa0 The trapped oil was consumed in about 28 minutes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>BP continues to use chemical dispersants, which, along with natural dispersions of oil, will address a large portion of the slick.\xc2\xa0 Nearly 100,000 gallons of dispersant have been used today.</p>\n<p>Among other response activities are on-water skimming, subsurface wellhead operations, continued efforts to see if they can get that shut-off valve to close, and significant booming efforts underway to protect vital shoreline.</p>\n<p>Right now at least 174,000 feet of boom have been deployed, and other boom will be deployed at six staging areas.\xc2\xa0 And they are ready to be deployed right now.</p>\n<p>In addition, approximately 1,100 total personnel are currently working the spill.\xc2\xa0 And 685,000 gallons of oily water have been collected so far, using nearly 50 vessels and multiple aircraft who are engaged in the response.</p>\n<p>We will continue to push BP to engage in the strongest response possible.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to oversee their efforts, to add to those efforts where we deem necessary, and to ensure, again, that under the law, that the taxpayers of the United States ultimately are reimbursed for those efforts.</p>\n<p>But that is not the key focus, I must say, right now.\xc2\xa0 Our key focus is making sure that people know what is going on, they understand what relief efforts are underway, what the extent of the response is, what we know, what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about this incident, and how we intend to move forward.</p>\n<p>And with that, let me introduce Rear Admiral O\xe2\x80\x99Hara.</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I was asked to give you an update on the activities today, but I think the Secretary has covered that very well.\xc2\xa0 Let me help put into perspective some of the interactions that occur.</p>\n<p>The Coast Guard is the federal on-scene coordinator.\xc2\xa0 So we have the leadership role for spills that occur in the coastal zone for this spill, in particular.\xc2\xa0 We have been very aggressive and proactive in our response, but we have not been alone.\xc2\xa0 We work with federal partners -- there are 16 federal agencies who form the National Response Team.\xc2\xa0 We also work very closely with state and local authorities and with nongovernmental organizations -- as we move forward with the response, there are roles that volunteers can take and the NGOs are critical in helping us properly channel that drive and energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And finally, the responsible party, British Petroleum.\xc2\xa0 BP has taken a number of steps, as has been mentioned -- the controlled burns, the skimming, the booming, the activities to try and secure at the sub-floor surface -- we are working very closely with them, but as responsible parties, the role of the Coast Guard and the unified command partners to ensure that they move forward with activities that are safe, that are appropriate, and that will do the job to secure and remove this oil.</p>\n<p>Our focus in particular today is looking very carefully at the preventive booming that\xe2\x80\x99s occurring, using the best science that\xe2\x80\x99s available to us; working in conjunction with NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s scientific support experts, as well as EPA, to ensure that the responsible party is taking advantage of all the pre-planning that has been done to protect fragile areas -- because at this point the trajectory has the spill, the leading edge of the oil, reaching landfall in the Mississippi Delta region sometime later tomorrow.</p>\n<p>We are working very carefully at sea as well so that we continue the skimming operations.\xc2\xa0 The controlled burn yesterday was very successful.\xc2\xa0 The sea and wind conditions today do not allow us to continue to have a controlled burn today.\xc2\xa0 As soon as there is an appropriate window we will continue the controlled burn activity because it was very effective yesterday.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a break and answer questions when time.</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I am David Hayes, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here today for Secretary Ken Salazar, who is in Houston at the BP command center, reviewing the operations, asking the tough questions.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s getting an update on the company\xe2\x80\x99s progress in closing the leaks from their well and to ensure that they clean up the spill as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>As has been mentioned, BP, as the responsible party, is still at work dealing with this issue.\xc2\xa0 And in particular, they\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to activate the blowout preventer stack to shut the well.\xc2\xa0 They have yet to be successful.</p>\n<p>We are moving with them on relief efforts.\xc2\xa0 We have approved the drilling of a second -- of a relief well that could begin drilling within a matter of days, and we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing application for a second relief well, should that be needed.\xc2\xa0 As the President has directed, we are using every resource available to work on this response effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re also taking immediate steps to get to the bottom of how this happened, to ensure that industry is following safety and drilling regulations that are in place.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, of course, the joint investigation was announced by Secretary Napolitano and Secretary Salazar.\xc2\xa0 That is underway.\xc2\xa0 That joint investigation will have every tool it needs, including subpoena power, to get to the bottom of what went wrong.</p>\n<p>Also, Secretary Salazar has ordered immediate inspections of all of our deep -- all of the deepwater drilling rigs and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Our inspectors will verify that companies are following the law and all regulations as they conduct their operations.\xc2\xa0 That inspection operation is underway as we speak.</p>\n<p>Finally, Secretary Salazar is convening a meeting of industry leaders and experts later today to talk about additional immediate steps to be taken to reduce the potential for a catastrophic blowout like the one that occurred on the Deepwater Horizon.\xc2\xa0 We also want to ensure that they are providing every resource and every idea available to help.</p>\n<p>Obviously, although this type of incident is rare, it\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily serious, and we expect industry to be fully complying with the law and to be taking aggressive measures to ensure that this type of incident does not happen again.</p>\n<p>I believe that -- Administrator Jackson.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR JACKSON:\xc2\xa0 Hi, good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m Lisa Jackson, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\xc2\xa0 Over the past days, EPA has mobilized to respond to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with DHS, with the Coast Guard, and, of course, with the White House to monitor the situation and address environmental impacts.</p>\n<p>First, EPA is providing full support to the United States Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 As you heard the Rear Admiral explain, the Coast Guard is in the lead, and EPA on the National Response Team provides support.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve moved our initial resources to the command center in Louisiana, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be moving additional resources there today and tomorrow, as well as to Alabama and Mississippi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have stood up an air-monitoring program.\xc2\xa0 That program has begun already.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be getting information on the results of the first samples out and on our Web site.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to beef up that program as we\xe2\x80\x99ve now learned that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with additional breaches, which probably means additional controlled burns in the future.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>EPA has air-monitoring aircraft that are -- one, that is gathering information on the impact of the controlled burn on air quality, both in the area of the burn, and, of course, further away.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re collecting air data from fixed and portable air-monitoring stations in the area.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll analyze that data and, as I said, make it public in the coming days, certainly as soon as possible, along with the air-monitoring plan, which is in draft and which will be revised as we go along, and as the situation changes.</p>\n<p>Third, as has been discussed already, we expect the oil to hit the shoreline in the near term.\xc2\xa0 In that event, the Coast Guard will remain in the lead.\xc2\xa0 The Coast Guard is the lead on that water and in the coastal zone.\xc2\xa0 As that happens, though, we expect EPA\xe2\x80\x99s role will expand.\xc2\xa0 EPA is generally the lead for land-based cleanups.\xc2\xa0 So we are preparing for that scenario by increasing our support to the Coast Guard and our other federal -- and very importantly our state partners -- in ramping up the monitoring of air quality.\xc2\xa0 Surface water impacts will be next, and that will include sampling the water.</p>\n<p>Finally, as the oil does hit the shoreline, EPA will provide support to assess the impacts on the coastal shoreline and play a key role in implementing the cleanup.\xc2\xa0 As a daughter of the Gulf Coast, I know that it is our job to ensure people that we will be eyes and ears working with the states who have valuable and vital resources to monitor air, water and land quality.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, let me just one quick thing, just announcement, the regular onsite media briefing that has happened each afternoon in the Gulf will take place as scheduled in addition to this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, could someone explain under what circumstances DOD will come in?\xc2\xa0 Does BP have to request that for some reason?\xc2\xa0 And then when or if DOD does become involved, what exactly can they provide in terms of equipment or technology that BP and the Coast Guard cannot do?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a BP request.\xc2\xa0 What we have done is reached out to the Department of Defense to see in light of, you know the depth of the water, the complexity of the spill and like whether they have any either expertise or actual assets in addition to all the other things that are being employed that would be useable either, A, to plug the leak, stop the leak, speed up the repair of the leak, or assist in making sure that a minimal amount of water -- or oil, excuse me, reaches the shoreline.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s being done at the operational level today working with the Coast Guard, the Department of the Interior, the EPA, NOAA, and the other federal agencies that have been involved since the day of this spill.\xc2\xa0 And if and when they have something to add, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly make that known.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether -- at this point whether they do have assets that would be useful --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Not right now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was something the President authorized looking into last night during the briefing.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the frame of reference most people have on this is the Exxon -- on oil spills is the Exxon Valdez; that was 11 million gallons.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an estimate that this could be well over 4 million gallons, under a worst-case scenario.\xc2\xa0 Could this turn into a catastrophe approaching that level?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think by designating it a spill of national significance, we are already illustrating that this is one that every available asset will be useable should it be necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the difference with the Valdez -- the Valdez was a knowable quantity of oil because it was a ship.\xc2\xa0 This is leakage from a well.\xc2\xa0 Now, over the course of time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the amount of oil that has come out.\xc2\xa0 NOAA has been able to revise estimates based on the length of time of the incident.\xc2\xa0 Those estimates will become better and better over time.\xc2\xa0 But we are deploying as if this would be a major incident.</p>\n<p>Would I use that kind of language?\xc2\xa0 Would I throw out those kind of numbers?\xc2\xa0 I think that itself would be premature.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some local officials are already complaining.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been nine days and they\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated with the pace of the federal response.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to them?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, BP is the responding party.\xc2\xa0 We are overseeing them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with all of the state and local partners.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the key thing is that there has been the inability of BP to -- through whatever methodologies they\xe2\x80\x99re using to get this shut.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t just lay this on BP.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the federal government certainly has a response to respond to a catastrophe like this --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 We understand that, but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s understand, Chip, I think one of the things the Secretary is talking about, as per your example earlier on the Exxon Valdez, in 1990 the law was passed that didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow an oil company to do what had been done and hand the bill to you and me.\xc2\xa0 It was -- it\xe2\x80\x99s now the responsibility of the oil company, in this case BP, British Petroleum.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Understanding that -- let\xe2\x80\x99s understand over the course of the past many days the situation has changed several times.\xc2\xa0 The well was initially recapped.\xc2\xa0 Then it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t capped.\xc2\xa0 We found, as of yesterday, additional breaches.\xc2\xa0 Our response has been commensurate with that each time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the federal response be to respond to the possible worst-case scenario right from the start?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Let the Admiral talk to this.</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 I would assure you that we are being very aggressive and we are prepared for the worst case.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have mobilized in the numbers that we have, and worked out a plan that is as large and as broad-sweeping as the one that\xe2\x80\x99s in place, looking at the four states with likely impacts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have a very important distinction to make between this case and Exxon Valdez.\xc2\xa0 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which was precipitated by the tragedy in Alaska, has put forward a response plan with levels of certification and qualification for those who respond to oil spills.\xc2\xa0 And we have professionals who are on call.\xc2\xa0 The companies that deal in cargoes that would be pollutants have to have plans in place.\xc2\xa0 They have to have commitments with recovery operators.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what has happened.\xc2\xa0 We have those professionals that are at the scene, hired through the plan that BP was required to maintain.</p>\n<p>They are at much higher levels of preparedness.\xc2\xa0 We have great advances in technologies.\xc2\xa0 The controlled burn, for instance, came much earlier in this bill than it was ever enabled in the Exxon Valdez case, and so we are putting tools to target much earlier and have assurance that this is not an Exxon Valdez type of case.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, what do the people who live in the affected region -- especially the Louisiana Delta, which is about to hit the coast in the next day -- what do they need to know?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 First of all, that the parish presidents and others have been working with us and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with them very closely.\xc2\xa0 We understand the concern -- the concern about fisheries area, the concern about other commercial activities that happen near sensitive environmental areas are involved.\xc2\xa0 They need to know that there has already been a significant amount of booming to protect those areas from oil sheen that may not have evaporated or been skimmed.\xc2\xa0 They need to know those efforts will be ongoing and continuing.</p>\n<p>They also need to know that we will be open and transparent with them.\xc2\xa0 They need to know that there is already a BP system set up for them to file claims for their own individual damages.\xc2\xa0 We will oversee that as well.\xc2\xa0 And they need to know that we will be staying on top of this as long as this incident is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, if I could just do a quick follow-up, and that is, apparently BP was estimating spillage was 1,000 barrels a day, and you guys think it\xe2\x80\x99s five times that.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think BP was so off in their estimate?</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn to my partner from NOAA and let her -- Dr. Lubchenco -- speak to some of the science.\xc2\xa0 But I would tell you that we are at very deep depths; it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to assess accurately given where this is located.\xc2\xa0 There are signs -- we can see the fluid that\xe2\x80\x99s emanating from the places in the riser pipe that have been perforated.\xc2\xa0 We know what that is in terms of temperature and what the volume may be that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an estimate, a best estimate, that was worked in consultation with British Petroleum, but also with the scientific support coordinator.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But then, as we move through time and we see the product on the surface, there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information that can be determined from the appearance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it to you to pick up there, Dr. Lubchenco.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Lubchenco -- Jane Lubchenco -- Administrator of NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What the Admiral says is absolutely correct.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult under these circumstances to have any precise estimate.\xc2\xa0 There is no one magic number.\xc2\xa0 The initial calculations, there was agreement among BP and NOAA scientists that the likely, approximate rate of flow was around 1,000 barrels a day.\xc2\xa0 It quickly became obvious, however, that there was more oil accumulating at the surface than would be possible at that flow rate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have since redone those calculations, taking into account aerial observations, using satellite and aircraft -- so how much total area at the surface is being covered; what is the type of oil; what is the distribution of it -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover 100 percent of the surface, it\xe2\x80\x99s often in cornrows and streams -- so what is the percent area coverage.\xc2\xa0 And then you subtract from that the burning that has been done with the platform and the oil on the surface with the controlled burn, for example -- the application of dispersants, skimming operations and in situ.\xc2\xa0 And you can come up with a number that is then averaged over the total number of days.\xc2\xa0 And so the revised upward estimate of 5,000 barrels per day that was announced last night is a reflection of those calculations.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s quite likely we will continue to pay close attention to what is on the surface and to do these numbers, and there may be estimates -- revised estimates down the road.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- simply observing where the oil is coming out is insufficient to really calculate any flow rate with any degree of accuracy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was mentioned that a relief well permit was granted that could happen within the next coming days, but a company representative himself said it could take up to 90 days for that relief well to be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how long the original was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to be effective.\xc2\xa0 So how long are we talking about before this can get under control?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are several potential ways to get this under control.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the relief valve is the final and most assured final step -- that would be to essentially drill down the 19,000 feet to where the formation is and to block off the well that is now open.\xc2\xa0 So that -- this particular well took 90 days to drill -- the one that is -- that the accident occurred on.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re just estimating that it could take up to another 90 days to put the relief well in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the BP on two other major approaches.\xc2\xa0 One is to deal with this blowout preventer stack and to take -- to use every capability to try to get it -- the rams to close.\xc2\xa0 That work continues.\xc2\xa0 The other thing -- the other approach that\xe2\x80\x99s being used is a cofferdam is being constructed that would be lowered down to just above the leak.\xc2\xa0 It would essentially collect the oil and then pump it up to the top so that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it dispersed and a much more efficient collection system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the best-case scenario is how long until this -- you get this oil under control?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Well, best-case scenario is that the blowout preventer efforts -- interventions which are still underway -- work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And worst-case scenario is we could see 5,000 barrels a day for the next 90 days?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 It could be 90 days before the relief valve is put in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you tell us what impact this incident is having on the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of offshore oil drilling, the proposal he put out some weeks ago to expand some offshore oil drilling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get Carol and David, who both have --</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 I think our focus, frankly, is on this particular matter -- that we are dead set at looking at what happened here, and dealing with it, and trying to learn the lessons of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it for Carol.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The announcement that was made of Secretary Salazar about a new five-year drilling plan is the beginning of a process, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really important for everyone to understand -- and we said it at the time and we want to say it again here today -- that there will be ample opportunity for public input, there will be ample opportunity for congressional and governor input.\xc2\xa0 That is the beginning of a process, not the end of a process.</p>\n<p>Obviously, what\xe2\x80\x99s occurring now will also be taken into consideration as the administration looks to how to advance that plan and what makes sense and what might need to be adjusted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might it be expected to have an adverse impact on expanding offshore oil drilling?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, as David said right now, we need to stay focused on the incident.\xc2\xa0 We need to learn from the incident.\xc2\xa0 We need to take that information.\xc2\xa0 And as the process for the five-year OCS plan -- public hearings, et cetera -- unfolds, that all needs to be folded in.</p>\n<p>That plan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t automatically open up an area to drilling.\xc2\xa0 It starts a process, and an area may or may not become open to drilling.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that last point -- and I would just emphasize that -- emphasize Carol\xe2\x80\x99s last point, but also say that the President renewed his concern about the incident this morning, in ensuring that -- how that impacts any future decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made, again, based on a plan that designates the possible areas to be opened.</p>\n<p>Suzanne.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, if I could just follow up, does it give anyone pause, in light of what has happened here, about the wisdom or the efficacy of opening up offshore drilling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Suzanne, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand we are -- the area that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at broadly right there is where we get about a third of our domestic oil right now.\xc2\xa0 So there are hundreds of oil and gas wells in this area.\xc2\xa0 I would -- again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand both what David and Carol said about the President designated -- and you heard the President say it that day.\xc2\xa0 We have looked at -- based on the fact that the ban on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf had expired, we looked at additional areas that could be open possibly to further drilling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as Carol said, that starts a process.\xc2\xa0 That is not a -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was not the end, rather the beginning of a longer process that will eventually evaluate from the Department of the Interior, the Minerals Management Service, the efficacy of each of those -- each petition to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is still confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to expand offshore drilling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what caused what\xe2\x80\x99s happening today.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that short of knowing -- today we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what caused this.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re saying that David and Ken and others came to the President and said, here\xe2\x80\x99s what caused it, would that -- could that possibly change his viewpoint?\xc2\xa0 Well, of course.\xc2\xa0 I think our focus right now is, one, the area, the spill, and two, also to ultimately determine the cause of it and see the impact that that ultimately may or may not have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much time do the people of Louisiana have before this oil hits the shore?\xc2\xa0 Is this imminent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Rear Admiral Brice-O\xe2\x80\x99Hara said that we think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that -- later tomorrow afternoon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of how much damage, what kind of impact that could have?\xc2\xa0 And can you also -- somebody talk about the impact on the wildlife?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, hitting shore presumes no dispersant, no skimming, no burning, and no boom.\xc2\xa0 But the booming is going on, in particular in places where according to the trajectories we think it would head for land first.\xc2\xa0 And that is this outer area right here in Louisiana -- it\xe2\x80\x99s deployed right up there.\xc2\xa0 So you can see that\xe2\x80\x99s where the boom has been deployed.</p>\n<p>Admiral.</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just add that there is a -- what\xe2\x80\x99s called an area contingency plan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what all of the involved stakeholders have pre-planned.\xc2\xa0 We know where the sensitive areas are -- nesting areas, fishing areas.\xc2\xa0 All of the habitat is well understood.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of a plan as to how you then would lay out the boom to protect threatened areas from the product that\xe2\x80\x99s coming in.\xc2\xa0 There is imprecision of just what the winds and the sea state will do with this slick as it moves closer to land.\xc2\xa0 But our best estimate is tomorrow, late tomorrow early into Saturday.\xc2\xa0 There is a little bit of a piece that seems to be floating somewhat separate from that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re watching that carefully.\xc2\xa0 But the boom will be there ready to respond.</p>\n<p>And then it\xe2\x80\x99s a layered approach.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the only thing.\xc2\xa0 Behind booms you have absorbent pads.\xc2\xa0 You have cleanup that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a cleanup team hired by the responsible party; the polluter is paying.\xc2\xa0 But the Coast Guard, the federal government family, will be there in our roles to oversee that response and make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe, that it\xe2\x80\x99s efficient and effective in the right places that have already been delineated with the longstanding plan for the region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s been the impact to wildlife so far?\xc2\xa0 Do we know?</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 We have no indication -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Dr. Lubchenco to speak to that as well -- we have no indication that there has been any recovered wildlife.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes you might see seabirds.\xc2\xa0 None of that has appeared yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there will be?</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xc2\xa0 It depends upon how the oil travels, how effective the booming is.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared.\xc2\xa0 We are assuming worst case, so we will be prepared for that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s also understand, this is -- as was said, this is also dependent upon weather conditions.\xc2\xa0 So understanding that, I also want to let you all know that while we have been in here, the President has reached out and talked with Governors Jindal, Crist, Perry, and Riley -- Riley and Barbour -- the five Gulf State governors.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more detailed readout on that a little bit later.</p>\n<p>Jeff, did you have something?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Robert.\xc2\xa0 As the administration looks at the causes of this, would you support having a pause in new deepwater oil drilling, so that oil companies can prove they have the technology and the ability to control and prevent these types of spills?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 David, do you want to -- David and Carol.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Everything is on the table.\xc2\xa0 We are looking at -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why collecting the best minds this afternoon to look and see what the issue was.\xc2\xa0 As Robert alluded to, this is an extraordinarily unusual event.\xc2\xa0 The last time there was a blowout like this with loss of life was 1984.\xc2\xa0 And in the meantime, we have a thousand offshore platforms or mobile rigs in operation producing 30 percent of our domestic energy supply.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we are determined to get to the bottom of it, and to enhance the safety issues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary Salazar today is announcing the additional inspections, and we are looking at additional short-term steps that we can take.\xc2\xa0 And I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about that in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might those short-term steps include a pause in --</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 I do not know.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of evaluating.\xc2\xa0 This is a highly regulated area.\xc2\xa0 We think the fundamental practice is safe.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking very hard at everything.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one follow-up for Carol.\xc2\xa0 Carol, does this -- how does this affect your efforts to get a climate bill advanced?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said yesterday, we remain committed to comprehensive energy reform.\xc2\xa0 We continue our efforts with members in the Senate, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be continuing these.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this will become, I think, part of the debate; that goes without saying.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it means that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get the kind of important energy legislation that we need for the people of this country if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to create the clean energy jobs that will allow us not only to build our renewables here, to build clean batteries here, but also to compete in the global demand for clean energy technologies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does this not hurt the process a little bit, a process that\xe2\x80\x99s already kind of hurting?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I think it becomes part of the debate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way these things happen.\xc2\xa0 Something happens and it has to then be incorporated into the debate.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at all energy production when we talk about comprehensive energy reform for this country.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I\xe2\x80\x99d also mention -- I would take into account what the Department of Interior announced yesterday as also weighing in on the debate by approving the first offshore wind farm in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Salazar said during that announcement this is the beginning of a host of these along the Eastern Coast.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So two things, Robert.\xc2\xa0 One, is there a reason why this kind of assembly, with all of these folks and you briefing us, didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen earlier?\xc2\xa0 And this goes sort of to Chip\xe2\x80\x99s question about response.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you guys are completely geared up today, but why haven\xe2\x80\x99t we seen this kind of geared up earlier?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read many of the stories in your paper.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got reporters that have covered, as I mentioned, the daily media briefings that have generally happened at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon.\xc2\xa0 An additional one happened last evening to announce the new information about an additional breach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All of the members that are standing behind me represent departments that have been keeping the President up to date for as long as this has been an incident that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching.\xc2\xa0 The President spent quite a bit of time a week ago getting fully updated on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>I would say this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to presume that this won\xe2\x80\x99t continue to happen -- but as we go farther, we learn more, and circumstances change.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard each and every person here say we have planned for and dispersed resources for whatever the worst-case scenario might be:\xc2\xa0 80,000 feet of boom, with more in the area, to potentially be deployed; a whole host of activities that are being carried out to ensure that what we envision as the worst-case scenario doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up one other --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You want to add something?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to add something to that, which is to say that as the spill occurred, the initial first on-scene responder, Coast Guard; the initial focus, of course, was removing -- helping remove workers and also the search for the 11 missing workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>By Friday we had convened the National Response Team and we had convened that at the Cabinet level to begin making sure that on the scene, on the ground in Louisiana, in the Gulf Coast, everything was being done and coordinated properly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The press has been focused on the ground there simply because that\xe2\x80\x99s where the information was.\xc2\xa0 The reason for this today is because now, as information is becoming more and more available, we have declared this an incident of national significance and we wanted to make sure that you and, in particular, the residents of the Gulf Coast knew the extent not only of our involvement, but of the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask one other thing?\xc2\xa0 I went back and read this morning the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech that he gave at the end of March on the offshore oil drilling, and to be fair, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a speech about the beginning of a process, he talked about that there will be critics on the left and critics on the right, but that he was convinced that opening these areas to more oil drilling, more oil exploration was the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But understand -- can I just -- understand, Mike, that there is a legal process in what he announced that has to be done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President might not have enumerated the length of the legal process, but that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Department of Interior and the Minerals Management Service has a permitting process for each well and for each petition for that well.</p>\n<p>So understand that -- Mike, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as the President has said, as I think probably everybody in the States -- there is no one thing that can be done to reduce our dependence on foreign oil -- from an environmental, from a national security, or from an economic standpoint.\xc2\xa0 If there was one thing, rest assured somebody would have done it -- likely in a previous administration.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps to increase clean energy jobs, wind and solar investment, wind farms.\xc2\xa0 And the President does believe we have to increase domestic production.</p>\n<p>But again, understanding, Mike, that the process that the President announced was the beginning of that process because there are a host of legal things that have to happen -- I made mention of the wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts -- I think the paper said today that was -- this is basically a nine-year decision.\xc2\xa0 So understand that all of these do take some time.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano, could you take some immigration questions before you go?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s do these, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what we have left.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a much greater federal response to this.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an estimate of how much you think this is going to cost in a worst-case scenario, and who is going to bear the cost of that response?\xc2\xa0 Will it be American taxpayers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Under the Oil Pollution Act, BP pays for all this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They pay for everything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, would you agree with Henry Waxman --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me just go here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a point, though, where the federal government shifts from oversight of BP to saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking control and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the bill, and are we at that point?</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 We are certainly not at that point now.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, given the professionalism of our partner, BP, and -- maybe partner was -- let me back up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 They are not our partner -- they are not our partner.</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- bad choice of words.\xc2\xa0 Our responsible party has shown willingness, they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown resolve, they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown accommodation for what the government has asked of them.\xc2\xa0 They, too, have been forward leaning.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t emphasize enough in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening underwater -- the state of the art of that technology.\xc2\xa0 There are not easy answers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But relative to the spill response, we find that they are doing what they should be doing.\xc2\xa0 We will not let up on our vigilance and observation to ensure that they continue to bring everything possible to bear to manage this spill response and to prevent damage to fragile ecosystems.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR JACKSON:\xc2\xa0 Can I?\xc2\xa0 I actually just want to add one slight amendment to that.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to monitoring, to actually taking data to determine contamination -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s air, water, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s work on estimation of the amount released, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s deciding how to protect beaches or fisheries or fragile resources --- the government is doing that work.\xc2\xa0 EPA has tasked its contractors.\xc2\xa0 We will be sending a bill to BP at some point.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s our belief that not only the federal government, but, for example, those fixed-state monitors that are now being asked to step up and do more air monitoring or potentially water monitoring, that work is best done -- it\xe2\x80\x99s inherently governmental, but BP should pay for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that BP is responsible for ultimately footing the bill, but have there been any initial cost estimates that have been --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For -- the initial cost estimate for BP?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just total.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would direct that to BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I have an additional question for Deputy Secretary Hayes.\xc2\xa0 Could you elaborate at all on the meeting later today and who from industry will be here -- whether Secretary Salazar will be back in time?\xc2\xa0 Will BP be having a representative at that meeting?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar will be back.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be hosting the meeting.\xc2\xa0 There will be others from this stage at that meeting as well.\xc2\xa0 We have invited all of the major players in industry that do deepwater drilling and production to send their CEO and top technical folks to have a discussion about what we might consider doing in the short term to ensure safety, getting to the point that was made before.\xc2\xa0 So we expect it to be a technical and substantive discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any names of CEOs who will be there?\xc2\xa0 What companies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you -- not just who was invited, but ultimately who shows up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Robert, some Americans remember the Santa Barbara spill.\xc2\xa0 Many remember Exxon Valdez.\xc2\xa0 Once we know more, do you expect that because this is such a galvanizing event, the President will speak in detail to Americans about what happened, what it means environmentally, what it means for policies going forward?\xc2\xa0 Should we expect --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think as Carol said, this -- and as Secretary Napolitano, this is an incident of national significance and of national importance, and I anticipate that that could be possible in the coming days.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if someone here could speak on this -- this has a ripple effect, as far as the economy is concerned, on the fisheries, as well as gas prices.\xc2\xa0 Is there anyone in this administration who has already taken the lead or moved into the area trying to make sure that prices will not skyrocket as much as -- with this leakage and with possible problems with fish and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say, I will -- let me ask NEC on what they might be working on in terms of gas prices.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, one of the things that we discussed with the President this morning, you have shipping channels that could soon -- the area of the spill could soon be in a very large shipping channel, and the ramifications that may or may not have as well.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Can I just make one factual point?\xc2\xa0 This well was not a production well yet.\xc2\xa0 It was an exploration well.\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as if oil that was being shipped out to refineries has been lost.\xc2\xa0 This was an exploratory well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, it has a ripple effect -- and what should the American public brace for?\xc2\xa0 I mean people were screaming at $4 a couple of years ago.\xc2\xa0 Is that a possibility now with this because --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the conjecture of that.\xc2\xa0 I think as Carol said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if a known quantity of oil has been taken out of the market because this was exploration not production.\xc2\xa0 So, April, I think first and foremost, the people that are behind me are focused on managing this incident and ensuring that it has a minimal effect on our environment and our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are you seeing -- but are you seeing anything right now, as far as environmentally concerned, seeing fish washing up on the shores and things of that nature?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that was addressed earlier that that was not the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the calls to the governors -- has the President also reached out for any discussion with members of Congress from the area?\xc2\xa0 And, also, is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe members of Congress were briefed last --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed daily and sometimes multiple daily --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, is there any talk of the President going down to one of the command centers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- I can check scheduling on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got these guys going down there tomorrow, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip down there.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the administration agree --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, let me just -- Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t missed you.\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the Admiral mentioned the Mississippi Delta as maybe tomorrow being impacted.\xc2\xa0 What other -- my question to her is what other land areas might be at risk, and -- for example, the Florida beaches?\xc2\xa0 And when would you expect other areas to be impacted by onshore --</p>\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL BRICE-O\xe2\x80\x99HARA:\xc2\xa0 Certainly we are prepared for this spill to move throughout the Gulf dependent upon the wind and sea conditions.\xc2\xa0 And we monitor that through our partners at NOAA.\xc2\xa0 And their scientific support coordinators help us anticipate, and we generally have enough of a projection so that we can take the necessary steps.</p>\n<p>All of that said, Florida, under the federal on-scene coordinator who will be designated today in Miami to oversee the coordination of all operations on the Florida coasts, has been provided discussion, information and guidance to prepare themselves.\xc2\xa0 They also have contingency plans that will be brought to bear when the time is right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the worst case would be Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think given where the oil is and the calls that the President made, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the precaution that based on sea and wind conditions, this could go -- you know, again, it could -- what these guys are prepared to do is act on the worst-case scenario.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The action on the ground is to ensure that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working on right now.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I answer --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 One of the responsibilities that NOAA has in this regard is to stay on top of the weather forecasts and to do the oil spill trajectories.\xc2\xa0 We are able to do only a number of days out at a time because the winds are so variable this time of year.\xc2\xa0 When the oil first was released from the well, it stayed in that area.\xc2\xa0 It went -- the winds have shifted around a number of times since then, and what we are doing in addition as a federal family to preparing for the worst possible case, we are also providing relatively accurate forecasts for a number of days out with respect to not only the weather but the likely trajectory of the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re providing that to the federal coordinators in the region and to the states so that there is ample warning to prepare and understand where to place buoys and booms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this point, your trajectory shows the oil heading where?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 It is currently headed -- yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And only there?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 The current forecast is for it to head here and then to move up around this area.\xc2\xa0 But as the winds shift, which they likely do, that could change.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the briefing with members of Congress last night.\xc2\xa0 Henry Waxman made an assessment that he felt BP\xe2\x80\x99s response to this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t adequate.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if the administration agrees with him and if everything that\xe2\x80\x99s being said here and the intensifying government oversight represents an assessment that their plan, as required by law, is inadequate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand this.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIntensifying oversight\xe2\x80\x9d -- oversight is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not accurate.\xc2\xa0 We have -- based on the law, the U.S. government has oversight over this at the moment that it became an incident, okay?</p>\n<p>The President has asked us and asked us last evening, when we briefed him on the plane, and asked us again this morning, to ensure that we are being as aggressive as possible in doing all that we can, and that any and all resources that might help be deployed as quickly as possible in order to ensure that what we have doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become worse.</p>\n<p>So we are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s our focus, is ensuring that each and every step can be taken.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President asked that we -- the Department of Defense to begin to also look at what possible assets they have that could ultimately be helpful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is BP\xe2\x80\x99s plan adequate, then, in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, at the moment, I think you heard Rear Admiral say right now they are responding, we are overseeing that, and evaluating, as conditions change, whether that needs to change as well.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As this investigation continues over what caused this, are other rigs or other wells in the region being looked at or impacted in a way to prevent the problem from compounding?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, is the answer.\xc2\xa0 Per my earlier statement, we are increasing our inspection frequency.\xc2\xa0 We have a SWAT team of inspectors.\xc2\xa0 We have 55 -- the Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service has 55 inspectors on the ground, in the Gulf, dedicated to this task.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, inspections are proceeding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This particular rig was inspected how many times, and did it pass?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes, it was.\xc2\xa0 It was -- this particular rig started drilling in this location in January of this year.\xc2\xa0 Under the regulations, it\xe2\x80\x99s subject to monthly inspections.\xc2\xa0 It had monthly inspections, in fact, with the last inspection being less than two weeks before the incident.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, does that suggest that inspections are inadequate if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t find something two weeks ago?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY HAYES:\xc2\xa0 No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to determine until you determine the cause of what the incident was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about the slick itself, though.\xc2\xa0 First, what\xe2\x80\x99s the correct terminology in the White House or the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view at this point, because on Monday you guys had referred to it as surface oil sheen?\xc2\xa0 Is that still, with the 5,000-barrel-a-day estimate, the way to look at this?\xc2\xa0 And if I went out there into the middle of it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Would not be advisable.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but are we talking about something -- \xe2\x80\x9csheen\xe2\x80\x9d sounds somewhat trivial, compared to what we remember from the Exxon Valdez, which is gads and gobs of thick crude oil coming up onshore.\xc2\xa0 Is that what we see as a potential here, or are we talking about a thin slick of oil that might come onto the shore?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 It is all of that.\xc2\xa0 In parts it is thick enough to be able to skim and to move into a boom for burning.\xc2\xa0 In parts, as the oil -- as time has gone on, some of it has formed into balls and a large part of it is sheen.\xc2\xa0 And then there are different types of sheen depending on thickness.\xc2\xa0 If you want the technical definitions, I think we can arrange to get that information to you.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s all of those different types.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s useful to note that the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s being released is a light to medium crude, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a different type of oil than that released in the Exxon Valdez spill.\xc2\xa0 When it first emerges it\xe2\x80\x99s in a much more liquid form.\xc2\xa0 As it is exposed to weathering for a number of days it takes on a different texture.\xc2\xa0 Much of the oil is volatilized.\xc2\xa0 And so the oil that we anticipate coming ashore, for example, is more likely to be in the form of mats or strings or tar-balls.\xc2\xa0 So it does change through time.</p>\n<p>And the oil that is -- has dispersants applied to it becomes emulsified and is pulled away from the surface and down in subsurface.\xc2\xa0 So you would see different things in different places.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a uniform slick.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Last one here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano, you come, of course, from Arizona, a landlocked state.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve never dealt with anything like this before in your tenure as governor of Arizona -- has this been a steep learning curve for you as Homeland Security Secretary?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the terminology and the technology, yes.\xc2\xa0 In terms of managing an incident that involves multiple federal agencies and the intersect with state and locals, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been through several of those in my tenure as Homeland Security Secretary.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we do immigration?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you finished?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re finished, because the President is going to speak shortly and we want to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak on this subject?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he might speak on this.\xc2\xa0 I want to go check on that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I want to let you guys go a little early.\xc2\xa0 If you guys have immigration questions, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to come up there and answer them.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point you also to what the President said last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one thing.\xc2\xa0 What does the investigation \xe2\x80\x93 the investigation, could it be natural causes, could it be operator error, could it be sabotage?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you looking at all those --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the cause is, so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at -- determining what that cause is and obviously looking at anything.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the specifics of some of the things you just mentioned, but, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to figure out what happened, and that\xe2\x80\x99s currently ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, let me understand this.\xc2\xa0 When you say we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at anything, is sabotage a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, let\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I asked you that -- you said all three.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear on this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I do not want to get into the delineation of what might have caused something we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s determine, before we get off on to conspiracy theories, let\xe2\x80\x99s determine what happened.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to talk about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the President is going to be speaking -- making some remarks at the top of the Teacher of the Year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go check on.</p>\n<p>Thank you, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:05 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
