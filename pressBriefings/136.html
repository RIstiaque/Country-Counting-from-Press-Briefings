Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:58 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 So, as you may know, the U.S. Conference of Mayors is meeting in Washington this week.\xc2\xa0 And a significant group of mayors will be meeting with the President later today to discuss a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 I asked for the three best mayors in America -- (laughter) -- to join me at the White House briefing today.\xc2\xa0 A bipartisan group of the three best mayors in America have joined me today.\xc2\xa0 And so what I am inclined to do is to give them the opportunity to make brief statements at the top, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll stick around for a little bit to take some questions from all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\'ll just introduce them all, and then we\'ll go from there.\xc2\xa0 To my right is Mayor Sly James, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He was chosen specifically because he is one of the best three mayors in America.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 To his left is Mayor Ashley Swearengin.\xc2\xa0 She is the mayor of Fresno, California. And she is a Republican, but she is also somebody who committed to solving problems, and I think she is a good example of somebody who does not let partisan differences get in the way of actually trying to do the right thing for her city.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll talk more about that.\xc2\xa0 And then, to my left is Mayor Marty Walsh from the great city of Boston.</p>\n<p>\n\tMayor James, do you want to just start and we\'ll work our way across?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be happy to.</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, first of all, it\'s great to be here.\xc2\xa0 And I noticed the groan when I was introduced.\xc2\xa0 I guess that has something to do with the fact that the Royals are world champions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Far be it from me.\xc2\xa0 But I am here to say, first of all, that Kansas City has done quite well under this administration.\xc2\xa0 We have been very fortunate to be the recipient of a $30 million Choice Neighborhoods grant that is being put to use in one of the gateway areas of Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 We are involved in ConnectHome and ConnectED.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Choice grant specifically is something that we treasure because it\'s a collaborative effort between universities, neighborhoods, and services and housing units that will really help change the dynamic in that part of our city.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re also very fortunate that we\'ve had great success and backing and support from the Department of Transportation with our streetcar project.\xc2\xa0 At one point, we had the largest TIGER grant for streetcar of anyplace in the country.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Foxx was there.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve collaborated quite well with Secretary Castro on HUD issues, and we\'re engaged with him again on mobility issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the thing that\'s most important to us is that we have, during the time that President Obama has been in office and I\'ve been in office, we have been able to increase our jobs numbers by a tremendous amount; over 80,000 jobs have found their way to Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t say create jobs because I think, as a mayor, I don\'t create jobs.\xc2\xa0 We simply try to build an environment in which jobs can foster.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve done that by promoting entrepreneurs and startups.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this has been an administration that has helped my city tremendously, and for that I\'m grateful -- because, at the end of the day, we\'re trying to move an agenda along that betters the lives of our citizens and provides them with jobs and services that they need, and this has been an administration that has reached out to us -- without our asking a lot of times -- and done some very good things for the people of Kansas City, Missouri.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I suppose we\'re starting with baseball credentials, so I\'ll just say Fresno is not far from San Francisco -- (laughter) -- and with the Giants championships on the table for all of you all to admire.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, let me just say, good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I\'m Ashley Swearengin, Mayor of Fresno, California -- a 515,000-person city right in the heart of the state.\xc2\xa0 We\'re the fifth largest in California and also the 34th largest city in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tFresno is known for being the food capital of the world.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also the fastest-growing region in California and we\'re known for our young and our diverse population.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, in recent decades, we\'ve also been known for chronic, long-term economic challenges, and a near financial crisis during the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\'m very grateful and proud to say today that those economic conditions are being reversed in our city, in no small part thanks to partnerships with and support from the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 In 2011, Fresno was selected as one of six cities in the nation to participate in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative.\xc2\xa0 As a result, we had half a dozen federal agencies that were assigned to our city to help us with our economic development plans, our downtown revitalization efforts, as well as our transportation infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, we had two federal officials actually move to Fresno -- they were embedded in the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 They worked directly with local officials to help us really chart a new path for our city.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo almost five years later, the results are pretty incredible.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve developed, environmentally cleared, and adopted local land-use plans that are geared towards revitalizing the older parts of our city and really accommodating new growth in Fresno.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, California broke ground on its high-speed rail system.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the first of its kind in the nation, and that happened in downtown Fresno.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext month we\'re breaking ground on another major public infrastructure project to support our downtown revitalization and our historic Main Street.\xc2\xa0 Next week, we\'re issuing a contract to construct two new transit lines that are federally funded that serve major portions of our city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn top of all of that, Fresno\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment rate has been cut in half.\xc2\xa0 Chronic homelessness has dropped by 60 percent.\xc2\xa0 And after coming dangerously close to having to file municipal bankruptcy in 2013, I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud to say that Fresno has paid off all of our negative fund balances.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to restore core city services, and we\'re just two years away from hitting our targeted general fund emergency reserve levels.\xc2\xa0 That will be the largest such rainy day fund in the history of our city.\xc2\xa0 And I say that to say I really am a Republican.</p>\n<p>\n\tChallenges in our city still remain, of course.\xc2\xa0 We have much work to do, but our partnership with the Obama administration has been pivotal in helping Fresno reverse the course of many decades of decline and to chart a new future for our city.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mayors.\xc2\xa0 And before I start my formal remarks, I want to first of all say this is pretty cool.\xc2\xa0 Usually as a mayor you don\'t say it\xe2\x80\x99s cool talking to the press. But today is one of those days.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s great to be here.\xc2\xa0 And I have no idea why I\xe2\x80\x99m up here because my sports credentials certainly don\'t fly with Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 And I know that my little football team is playing Sunday, so sorry, guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity to be here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to thank Josh and I want to thank my fellow mayors for joining me today.\xc2\xa0 One of the things -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been mayor of Boston now for -- heading into my third year.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that\'s been the most surprising about being mayor of a city is the support you get from the administration in Washington, D.C. -- never really expecting that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama and the White House has been tremendous partners in cities across America, particularly with -- and this is probably a little controversial -- particularly with the inability for Congress to act on so many different pieces of legislation that affect our cities.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that that\'s not happening in Washington, D.C., it\xe2\x80\x99s really taken upon the mayors that we have to do more.\xc2\xa0 We have to do more to try and get things done.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the Obama administration, the Obama White House has been a very good partner in many of those because they understand what it takes to move cities ahead and what it takes for cities to lead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBoston has been proud to answer the White House\xe2\x80\x99s call in ensuring health and safety in our communities, as well as growing opportunity for our children and all our residents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re investing right now because of initiatives working very closely with the administration in affordable homes.\xc2\xa0 We broke our record last year in the city of Boston by creating 1,000 low-income, affordable homes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not all of the housing we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the city of Boston.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a piece of low-income housing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to set records in other areas of housing.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe launched a citywide housing plan to create 53,000 units of new housing by the year 2030.\xc2\xa0 We\'re into the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s call to end veterans\xe2\x80\x99 homelessness.\xc2\xa0 And I was happy to announce at my state of the city two nights ago that we ended chronic veterans\xe2\x80\x99 homelessness in the city of Boston.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re working towards a goal of ending all chronic homelessness by the year 2018.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re supporting our workforce by creating skill-building opportunities.\xc2\xa0 Boston received a $3 million grant from the Department of Labor to go to apprentices and construction and hospitality.\xc2\xa0 We\'re offering free salary negotiation workshops with the American Association of University Women for women to help women understand and help them negotiate when they\'re going for a job so that the economic gap that they have with men gets closed.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other night we were able to -- we also announced a task force to look at a $15-an-hour minimum wage in the city of Boston.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have the ability in the city of Boston right now to raise the minimum wage because it\xe2\x80\x99s a state law, but we\'re going to work through a task force to see how we can do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe established the first-ever parental leave policy to support workplace and creative development.\xc2\xa0 Boston is also, I feel, a leader of community-police relations.\xc2\xa0 My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper has been a tremendous success in our city where we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged the community, particularly young men of color.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re also tying in the young women of color, as well.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re very active there.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of our stats:\xc2\xa0 violent crime this year in 2015, went down by 3 percent; property crime went down by 10 percent; homicide rates fell to a 16-year low; all the while our arrests also dropped by 15 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in Boston we don\'t believe in locking people up; we believe in lifting people up.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re working to make that happen across our city.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in 2016, I look forward to working very closely with the White House to address the issue of substance abuse.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Conference of Mayors named me the chairman of the substance abuse task force.\xc2\xa0 I have a great working relationship with Michael Botticelli, who works for the administration, and I look forward to working with the administration because substance abuse is in every single one of our communities all across America.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t matter if you\'re a Democrat, Republican, independent, Green Party, drug addiction is affecting everyone.\xc2\xa0 So the White House has made a real commitment.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Conference of Mayors have made a real commitment.\xc2\xa0 I look forward to working with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take some questions.\xc2\xa0 Here.\xc2\xa0 Tara, you want to go first?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Welcome.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m from Kansas City.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 You\'re delightful.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is rare.\xc2\xa0 Three people from Kansas City at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I work at the BBC, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about race relations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the administration and Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 What has the President done to help Kansas City and the state also around Kansas City deal with race relations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the best thing that he\xe2\x80\x99s done was he was elected twice.\xc2\xa0 That in and of itself says something about race relations because there were -- before his election, there were people who believed that that was an impossibility.\xc2\xa0 A lot of older African Americans thought they would never have an opportunity to see that in their lifetime.\xc2\xa0 So the mere fact that he was elected is a tribute not only to him, but to this country and the fact that there were people in this country far surpassing the numbers of African Americans who had to participate in that election to elect him.\xc2\xa0 So that gave us hope right off the bat.</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber two, he\xe2\x80\x99s been to Kansas City I think four times.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just because he likes the barbecue or my bowties.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been there because we\'re doing things.\xc2\xa0 And when he comes to the city and we\'re able to show the people of Kansas City that the President of the United States is in town, we\'re able to leverage that in the conversations about race.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe main thing that he has done is he\xe2\x80\x99s put into place a set of policies that in my city, we are able to build upon.\xc2\xa0 TechHire, for example, allows us to put people who have been out of the workforce for over 18 months back into employment.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that takes place and is very important in the minority community.\xc2\xa0 All of those things are important.\xc2\xa0 The Choice Neighborhood grant is going to affect a racially discrete area of town, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a diverse area of town.\xc2\xa0 And those types of things are things that actually have an impact on people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, and those are the types of things that we use in order to leverage good conversations about race and race relations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mayor Walsh, I was wondering if I could ask you about the minimum wage study that you announced a couple days ago.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some question about whether you support a $15.00 minimum wage, or whether the study is to determine whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99d support it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 Both.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the study is for both.\xc2\xa0 I support a $15.00/hour minimum wage, but also we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have business leaders, non-profits, community engagement workers sitting down and talking about how would this be implemented, what the effects would be.\xc2\xa0 I certainly support a $15.00/hour minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 As a legislator, I voted for the increase in minimum wage a couple times in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 But this is a task force to really look at how do we get there.\xc2\xa0 And also, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a state law changed to be able to get there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with people here at the White House on?\xc2\xa0 Or is that just something --</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President made the initiative -- spoke about it.\xc2\xa0 And really, when the President starts talking about -- and Secretary Perez, when we start talking about the $15.00 minimum wage -- the Secretary of Labor -- a lot of conversations start happening in Boston.\xc2\xa0 Cities like Seattle did it, and then it starts to go across the country.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of people have been talking about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have two hospitals in Boston -- Boston Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center -- that both increased their lowest wage to their employees to $15.00/hour.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see the momentum going that way, so I felt it was the appropriate time.\xc2\xa0 There was also a study that came out that said the income inequality gap is number one in the city of Boston in the country.\xc2\xa0 So we have to address those issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Juliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also for Mayor Walsh, this issue of substance.\xc2\xa0 But again, if the other mayors want to speak to this, too.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is something that the President has elevated in recent weeks.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what specifically you think this administration needs to do to help tackle this problem, and anything else you would say for context about how you think the national approach to heroin and prescription drug abuse has changed, given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing nationwide?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, just as far as a national approach, I think that the approach to addiction is very different in different cities and towns across America.\xc2\xa0 So I think what we have to do is -- not one system is going to fix the problem when it comes to addiction.\xc2\xa0 And I think, really, what the White House can do the best right now is sit down with the Conference of Mayors and work with us, and also with SAMHSA and with their own department, and figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s needed around the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSome cities and towns have done some good things.\xc2\xa0 Some states have done some good things.\xc2\xa0 Some states have ignored it because it\xe2\x80\x99s the stigma around it.\xc2\xa0 And when I say \xe2\x80\x9cignored\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying in a critical way.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like any family, any member watching this press conference right now, they have a loved one that\xe2\x80\x99s in the grips of addition, they can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to anyone, they\xe2\x80\x99re embarrassed, there\xe2\x80\x99s a stigma there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that part of what the White House can do the best is listen and then come up with some policies on how we address the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the fact that -- it can\xe2\x80\x99t be just a money situation; you can\xe2\x80\x99t just throw money at the situation, even though we do need money for detoxes and treatment centers.\xc2\xa0 So I think we have to work on how do we get a continuum of care that can work that way, and how do we also get some best practices into our schools and into America to talk about how do we get prevention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that the addiction that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing today, particularly around prescription drugs, is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen in this country before.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had addiction for a long time, but because of prescription drugs, we see it rampant. And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s different in every city, but at the end of the day it comes down to a stigma.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the White House can do a lot around it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that the other two mayors might want to say about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in your communities?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Kathleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question for Mayor Swearengin.\xc2\xa0 The President has lately been on a push to change the narrative around the economy, to change people\xe2\x80\x99s perception.\xc2\xa0 As part of that, he\xe2\x80\x99s been really critical of Republicans, saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking down the economy and exaggerating problems.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, from where you sit, if you agree with them on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly in our struggle in Fresno to deal with chronic, long-term unemployment.\xc2\xa0 When we see good job reports -- for example, in 2014, our job creation rate was actually one of the highest in the nation and one of the best in the world.\xc2\xa0 So, in Fresno, what we do is we celebrate that, we honor and recognize that achievement, but we also look at how high the mountain is that we still have left to climb.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, usually what I find in these debates, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s right versus left, or the other way around, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually a both/and.\xc2\xa0 It is both the case that there are good things happening, there\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, and there are strengths to build on.\xc2\xa0 But it also is the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot farther that we need to go.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s our focus in Fresno, is celebrate the success, but then get back to work, because we know we need 10 years of good job performance to really be where we want to be as a city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 JC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The mayor of Boston -- needless to say, tomorrow, within 24 hours, Mayor, we have a major snow event on its way.\xc2\xa0 Your advice?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You know it well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, I do.\xc2\xa0 I saw the mayor of Washington on TV last night, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s number one.\xc2\xa0 The best thing you can do is get on TV and talk about what the preparation is.\xc2\xa0 Number two is make sure you have in the wings -- if Washington gets hit with two feet of snow, which we dealt with last winter several times, be prepared to reach out to your partners.\xc2\xa0 My public works department in the city of Boston has already contacted me.\xc2\xa0 If we don\xe2\x80\x99t get hit with the snow that\xe2\x80\x99s getting hit in Washington, we brought our two truck-mounted snow blowers last year to remove the snow off the street.\xc2\xa0 So when I see the mayor later on today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to offer to her, if she needs these snow blowers to come to the city to help her, we will help.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, we had great help from around the country.\xc2\xa0 The White House reached out to us right away.\xc2\xa0 We had mayors from around the country that send their crews up and send their equipment up.\xc2\xa0 We needed it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we had literally three weekends -- three blizzards in a row.\xc2\xa0 We set a record, as you most of you in this room now, for all-time snow.\xc2\xa0 And it didn\xe2\x80\x99t melt until March or April.\xc2\xa0 And the last bit of snow melted in July -- I think it was July 17th.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I feel bad.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving tonight, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hopefully watch on TV and I\xe2\x80\x99ll look out the window and see it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Leslie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Mayor Swearengin, I had a question for you on -- the drought remains a critical problem in California.\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to the administration?\xc2\xa0 Is there more they could be doing on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 The drought is absolutely still a critical issue.\xc2\xa0 In California, even though we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see rainfall this year, it\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome sign.\xc2\xa0 But the reality is we still need major cooperation between the federal and the state government to make sure that to the greatest extent possible we are keeping and storing that water because we know we are a long way from being out of this hole that we\xe2\x80\x99re in.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is always a struggle.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very complicated issue.\xc2\xa0 And yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked with folks at the White House about the need to literally be in the weeds, counting the number of fish that may be close to a pump.\xc2\xa0 And the second we have a chance to turn on the pumps and store some water, we have to do that.\xc2\xa0 So it is a constant press for us from California here in D.C.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like the administration is doing enough?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on the issue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think yet we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the resolution that we need to see.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon both the federal and the state government to really efficiently manage the water situation and the pumps.\xc2\xa0 And of course there are great debates over exactly when the right moments are to turn them on.\xc2\xa0 But as mayor of Fresno, all I can say is make sure that every drop of water that can be stored for next summer is being stored.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mayor Walsh, first of all, my condolences to your team this weekend up in Denver.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going down.\xc2\xa0 Just letting you know now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I do honestly want to say congratulations on GE.\xc2\xa0 And this is probably for all three of you -- I want to talk about job attraction to cities and how you avoid brain drain.\xc2\xa0 This probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen often in Boston -- young people graduate, and they tend to stick around the hub.\xc2\xa0 But what advice would you give to mayors and other leaders in middle-size and smaller cities to keep their brains in town?\xc2\xa0 Because what happens is, often they\xe2\x80\x99ll graduate from college and they go to other places; whether in Kansas City, they move to Chicago or Denver; in Fresno, they go to Los Angeles or San Francisco.\xc2\xa0 What advice would you give?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first of all, we do everything we can to keep the talent in the city of Boston.\xc2\xa0 We lose a lot of people in Boston.\xc2\xa0 We have 25 college universities within the heart of the city, and 75 within the greater Boston, including Boston.\xc2\xa0 So we have those conversations all the time in our city. Some of it is by trying to change some social perceptions of Boston as far as the nightlife and make it more lively.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe housing stock is a big key.\xc2\xa0 Part of my reason for announcing the creation of 53,000 units of new housing is because the cost, the affordability of our city -- young people leave because they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to live there.\xc2\xa0 Also, trying to attract new businesses, tech and startup companies.\xc2\xa0 The downtown Boston area, which is all skylines and big buildings and the financial district, in the past it\xe2\x80\x99s been insurance companies and financial services -- 35 percent of those companies [sic] are filled by high-tech companies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have to constantly work at this every single day.\xc2\xa0 GE was a very big win for the city of Boston, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we stop there.\xc2\xa0 We have to continue to try and attract new businesses to our city.\xc2\xa0 So what I would suggest to other cities, it\xe2\x80\x99s about quality of life.\xc2\xa0 To keep young people, it\xe2\x80\x99s the jobs and quality of life.\xc2\xa0 And part of that quality of life is what\xe2\x80\x99s the environment living in that city, is it a safe city, is it a walkable city, is it an affordable city.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are the key components in trying to keep young people -- or attract young people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many jobs with GE, by the way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 About a thousand.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mayor James.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 We have a slightly different approach.\xc2\xa0 I, frankly, believe that the day of chasing smokestacks from one area to another has become too expensive and too unpredictable.\xc2\xa0 We like to try to grow our own and to create an atmosphere where people come from other places, like Boston, to Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disadvantage Mayor Walsh or Mayor Swearengin, but the fact of the matter is, the competition right now is less for businesses than it is for talent.\xc2\xa0 And we are definitely in the talent competition business.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we were chosen, along with Kansas City, Kansas, to be the first cities in the country to have a Google come in and install fiber, our phones lit up, our televisions lit up.\xc2\xa0 Everything lit up with people curious about how that could be used in order to promote entrepreneurism and startups.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been very successful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe started a place called Startup Village, which straddles the line between Kansas and Missouri, where people -- young people -- as a matter of fact, Mayor, there were two kids that showed up -- three kids that showed up at a reception for Code for America, and they came in off the street. I asked them where they were from, and they said they had just driven in from Boston to go live at Startup Village where they started their business that deals with software for home 3D printers.\xc2\xa0 And they moved to Kansas City; they\xe2\x80\x99re still there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 They must have left their Red Sox hats in the car.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 They did -- because now they\xe2\x80\x99re all wearing Royals jerseys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh!\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 But we have a tremendously active entrepreneurial population with a lot of startups.\xc2\xa0 We surprised Tech Week -- they brought Tech Week in on kind of an experimental basis, expecting 1,500 people; 4,000 showed up.\xc2\xa0 And during the time of Tech Week, he had a launch code that we used, and we gave away $500,000 in $50,000 blocks to 10 selected entrepreneurial enterprises, which have now grown and are getting secondary and third-level funding.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re developing jobs at home, because we believe that if we develop the jobs there, they\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to stay.\xc2\xa0 And the process of trying to chase the big companies costs cities way too much money in terms of incentives and such.\xc2\xa0 So we want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re building a city for the future that is attractive to people.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt that we have a very reasonable cost of living in Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 Anybody who wants to move to Kansas City, we have plenty of houses and you can afford them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just chime in quickly and reinforce what my colleagues have said.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice a theme, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to mayors, every mayor has the best city ever.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re all touting our city\xe2\x80\x99s credentials.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, absolutely the case for mid-size cities -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that you should have any expectation that you can find the money necessary to become a major center, like a Boston; in our case, San Francisco or L.A.\xc2\xa0 So you absolutely have to focus on, number one, build a great urban center in your community.\xc2\xa0 Cities have to have the type of quality urban infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 This generation wants to be in a downtown setting.\xc2\xa0 So making sure your city center is as amazing as it can be, authentic and genuine to who you are as a community -- number one.</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber two, I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat it again because it\xe2\x80\x99s that important -- entrepreneurship is really the key.\xc2\xa0 So, in Fresno, we focus on entrepreneurship education.\xc2\xa0 Started at the undergraduate level, developed a degree in entrepreneurship, taught a bunch of college students how to start their own businesses.\xc2\xa0 And then went to the graduate level, then down to the community college level, then high school.\xc2\xa0 We have the only high school in the United States that is dedicated entirely to entrepreneurship.\xc2\xa0 And now, every fifth-grader in Fresno Unified gets entrepreneurship training, as well.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the case that we have to grow our own, knowing that that really will reap the benefits down the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is to all the mayors.\xc2\xa0 What do you think of what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on in Flint, Michigan, the crisis there?\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday seemed to think this was a real cautionary tale about neglecting infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys share that view?\xc2\xa0 Have you been calling your water departments lately?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I spoke to Gina McCarthy last week from the White House because our water and sewer department is one of the best in the country -- Boston Water and Sewer -- partly because of a federal court case that forced us to make some changes.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach out to the people of Flint, Michigan and help them with some of the infrastructure problems.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an issue where I think mayors and the federal government have an obligation to come together and try and help another city that\xe2\x80\x99s in desperate need of support.\xc2\xa0 And I think that anything that we can do from the city of Boston through the White House, which we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to offer any support we can.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s our obligation as mayors, to work with the administration.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a partisan issue; that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American people and for the people of Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR JAMES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say that any time that you get more than three mayors in a room, there will be two subjects that are always going to be discussed.\xc2\xa0 One is education and the other is infrastructure -- because we deal with infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And I know that these mayors will tell you that the businesses that reside in our cities are very keen about the infrastructure that\xe2\x80\x99s available to them and the impact it has on their ability to conduct business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tInfrastructure has been neglected in this country and it needs to change, because if it does not change, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in serious trouble.\xc2\xa0 At some point, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to become a national security issue, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not already.\xc2\xa0 But infrastructure is huge, not just roads and bridges, but water infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 In Kansas City, we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in an EPA mandate now of an overflow control project; it\xe2\x80\x99s about 25 years on the horizon and about $4 billion.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very expensive and costly thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something, frankly, that we probably should have done 30 years and didn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re paying extra to catch up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens when you neglect things -- that old thing that we had that our mothers taught are a \xe2\x80\x9cstitch in time saves nine,\xe2\x80\x9d we\xe2\x80\x99re going that with infrastructure, except it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more serious and it\xe2\x80\x99s across the board.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo by addressing infrastructure in a positive and concrete way, we accomplish a couple things.\xc2\xa0 We become stronger, we become more agile.\xc2\xa0 We become more able to support our business and security needs.\xc2\xa0 But we also put people to work.\xc2\xa0 So infrastructure is huge.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have the water infrastructure problems that are going on in Flint, Michigan.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also a very serious health problem.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s horrible.\xc2\xa0 There should not be people -- there should not be children in this country, in this day and age, drinking leaded water, especially with what we know, and certainly not for as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s been going on.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have to take care of our business, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a basic thing.\xc2\xa0 Water is essential to life in this country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that should never have happened and hopefully will be rectified soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 I think about it every day.\xc2\xa0 I see the reports every night on the news.\xc2\xa0 And as I\xe2\x80\x99m watching what\xe2\x80\x99s unfolding, I am stunned by the tragic circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m also grateful that in Fresno we took significant steps over the last three years to raise the rates, which nobody likes.\xc2\xa0 No mayor ever wants to champion increasing water rates.\xc2\xa0 But we knew in Fresno, for 25 years there has been talk about the need to upgrade our infrastructure, take better advantage of our surface water, stop pulling water up out of the ground, which is potentially contaminated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it took us ultimately five years to get the rates passed.\xc2\xa0 We went through lawsuits.\xc2\xa0 We went through a voter referendum.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, those rates were passed.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, we\'ve got $600 million of infrastructure being spent to upgrade our water infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, I think ultimately Fresnans came to grip with the fact that we were going to have to invest in our water infrastructure, but all you have to do is turn on the TV and see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Flint to know that was the right decision.\xc2\xa0 And while painful in the immediate term, it is the right thing to do for our kids, our grandkids, and our great-grandkids.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have time for one more.\xc2\xa0 Mike, do you want the last one?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Brown is giving his state of the state address again today, and speaking of water, he\xe2\x80\x99s going probably address his Delta Fix plan.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you want to weigh in on that and what you think the impact might be.\xc2\xa0 And then also, a political question -- it\'s not often you hear a Republican praising the White House and talking about their cooperation with the White House.\xc2\xa0 To the extent that you might be on a statewide ballot again, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s this top two system, which is a little bit more unpredictable, but are you not worried about this clip being played down the road?</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR SWEARENGIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll take the second question first.\xc2\xa0 And you know, my mom and my grandmother were always big when I was growing up in saying give credit where credit is due, and you always tell the truth.\xc2\xa0 So it is the case that Fresno has been substantially supported and improved as a result of the work and our partnership with the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 To say otherwise would not be telling the truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that in every circumstance I may agree with the administration.\xc2\xa0 But it is absolutely the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s been good work done on behalf of the residents of Fresno. So I, as mayor, need to be the first one to help tell that story and speak the truth about what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether or not there are political consequences, there always are, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xc2\xa0 At some point, you have to choose a different path and choose leadership and do the right thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs far as the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s state of the union goes, I\'m sorry to miss it.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got other things going on here.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I don\'t know that there is a more complicated issue in the United States than water issues in California.\xc2\xa0 And I really applaud the Governor for taking on a comprehensive water fix.\xc2\xa0 I know there will be lawsuits, challenges -- there are all kinds of complicated issues that have to be worked out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFresno is south of the Bay Delta, and so, obviously, we would benefit from more water coming south.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly respect and appreciate, if that were my water in the Bay Delta, I would be fighting every bit as hard as we see people fighting there.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, ultimately, my hope is that cooler heads can prevail, that there are technological solutions, that there are policy solutions.\xc2\xa0 And honestly, if anybody can help figure this out it\'s going to be Governor Brown.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m certainly rooting for him to be successful in this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you for spending the time with us.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mayor Walsh, any chance you can take Papelbon back with you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMAYOR WALSH:\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on one football game right now at a time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We\'ll focus on the Red Sox later on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I think the only thing I would add to their presentation is I drew a similar conclusion and made a similar observation I think, Kathleen, that you alluded to, which is that I think you saw three local leaders in different parties standing up here telling about how optimistic they are about the future of their communities.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was indicative of the kind of optimism that most people are feeling about the direction of the country.\xc2\xa0 And surely there is more work to be done, and the President is certainly looking forward to all the things on his to-do list over the course of this year, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the important progress that\'s been made and the kind of momentum that we have built up.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe challenge for this country and the leaders of this country right now is how do we capitalize on that momentum, and how do we build on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, Kathleen, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions and our regularly scheduled programming here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, to change topics, I want to ask you about a British judge coming out with a report that says that President Vladimir Putin probably approved a plan to poison a Russian critic and spy, and I\'m wondering if the White House had something to add to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\'ve seen the reports about this inquiry and the conclusions that were drawn.\xc2\xa0 This is a high-profile case for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 There are some salacious details involved and it does look to be lifted right out of a spy novel of one form or another.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what it also points to is the way in which the political environment that currently exists in Russia seems to also extend, at least in some occasions, beyond Russia\xe2\x80\x99s borders.\xc2\xa0 Inside Russia, we see that critics and political opponents of the Russian government are often subject to threats, intimidation, and in some cases, death.\xc2\xa0 And this willingness to flout basic conventions around human rights and free speech and the ability to speak out and make your political views known, even if they are critical of the sitting government is something that we\'ve long been concerned about inside of Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think this particular investigation is a reminder of why this is a source of such serious concern not just here in the United States but on the part of many countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t expect to take any particular action or issue any sort of direct warning to -- do you support Cameron --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously -- in this case, the concerns that are expressed by the British government are unique because the incident took place on British soil.\xc2\xa0 So their concerns are understandable and I think it makes sense that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take some specific actions to try to address some of those concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have any actions to announce today in direct response to these findings, but I certainly wouldn\'t rule out any relevant future steps.\xc2\xa0 And some of that will involve a closer look at the actual investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I also wanted to get your reaction to Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s comments today.\xc2\xa0 She was very critical, as a mother of a veteran, of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s support for veterans, particularly veterans suffering from PTSD.\xc2\xa0 She blamed the President for some of her son\xe2\x80\x99s troubles.\xc2\xa0 Did the President see those remarks?\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to anybody about them?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the President saw the remarks. I can tell you that the reaction of some people I think is to make light of some of the rhetoric that we see on the campaign trail, particularly from Governor Palin.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is domestic violence is not a joke.\xc2\xa0 Gun violence is not a joke.\xc2\xa0 Problems with addiction are not a joke.\xc2\xa0 And the consequences -- or I should say the sacrifices that many of our men and women in uniform make for our safety and security are not a joke.\xc2\xa0 And these are issues that this administration is quite focused on.\xc2\xa0 We take them all very seriously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are many communities and families that are dealing with these very difficult challenges in a way that sometimes is difficult to talk about publicly.\xc2\xa0 But certainly this administration, over the course of the last seven years, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident over the year that remains, will be focused on many of the issues that are raised by this particular case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was she out of line?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying she was taking it lightly?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that instinct that some people have when hearing her rhetoric is to make light of it.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes those jokes come pretty easy.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, the issues that she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about are quite serious.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re certainly issues that we take quite seriously here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on to another topic.\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that the White House has granted the Pentagon a new authority to target ISIL in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm those reports?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why grant this authority now?\xc2\xa0 And what will this new authority allow that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new details to share with you in terms of the rules of engagement that our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan are operating under.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, they have been given a mission by the President of the United States to do two things.\xc2\xa0 The first is to conduct counterterrorism operations to target the remnants of al Qaeda and other terrorists that are operating in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of that is to prevent any sort of resurgence by al Qaeda or other extremist groups that want to try to plot against the United States or the homeland.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been focused on is supporting the Afghan government and trying to enhance their capability to provide for the security situation in their own country.\xc2\xa0 And as a part of those missions, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty aggressive in taking terrorists and extremists in Afghanistan off the battlefield, both to protect the United States, but also to protect our men and women who are serving in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd these are serious tasks, and there are American men and women in uniform who are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way right now that are making us safer.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude for their work.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything new to announce in terms of any greater authority or any sort of change in the missions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been given.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, health officials have confirmed the first birth of a baby in the U.S. affected by the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 How concerned should Americans be about the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas?\xc2\xa0 Should they be concerned?\xc2\xa0 Obviously right now the focus is on women who travel to these affected areas.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House doing anything to make preparations or expecting more cases?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we are trying to do at this state is to communicate with the American public about the precise nature of the risk.\xc2\xa0 I know Dr. Fauci was discussing this earlier today.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the CDC has concluded is that it would be appropriate at this point for pregnant women or women who may become pregnant to be mindful of the risk associated with traveling to other countries in the Western Hemisphere that have had -- where we know the Zika virus is being transmitted.\xc2\xa0 This is a mosquito-borne illness, and this is a mosquito-borne illness that traditionally is found in tropical areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the concern is not as much about the impact of the virus itself on an individual who is bitten by a mosquito, but rather the linkage that our public health professionals are concerned between contracting this virus and birth defects -- a particular kind of birth defect that has been seen in Brazil and has been -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s reason that some public health professionals are concerned that the spike that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a particular birth defect in Brazil may be connected to the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are at the stage now where we are trying to educate people about the risk that exists and to allow them to take the necessary precautions.\xc2\xa0 Again, the impact of the virus on somebody who is not pregnant or on men are symptoms that are rather mild.\xc2\xa0 And the concern is just the focus on the possible linkage between this virus and a particular birth defect that could have an impact on women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow is the anniversary of when the President in 2009 signed his order to close Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering do you guys have plans to ruin our snow day with a release of your Gitmo plan -- (laughter) -- or any update on when that might go out to Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any update for you in terms of the timing of a new plan that would be presented to Congress to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 What I have committed, though, is that when that report is presented to Congress that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it available publicly.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do is I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that if that comes tomorrow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on the Internet so that even if you are snowed in, you\xe2\x80\x99ll still be able to cover this remotely.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll just say I don\'t have the expectation that it\xe2\x80\x99s coming tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a specific guidance to share with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s talks with the leader of Pakistan and Afghanistan today.\xc2\xa0 One of the elements that you guys read out was that he was encouraging them to restart talks with the Taliban towards kind of a peace accord. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how viable you see those types of negotiations, especially in light of the Taliban attack on the university in Pakistan a couple days ago, and also whether the U.S. should get directly involved or if the U.S. is directly involved in those talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The United States has long been supportive of an Afghan-led reconciliation process.\xc2\xa0 And the conclusion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn here is one that I guess, based on the incident that you\'ve just cited, is pretty obvious, which is that the Taliban poses a security threat to both countries, and that the nations of Afghanistan and Pakistan are going to be able to more effectively confront that threat if they\'re able to more effectively cooperate.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re hoping to do and that\'s what we\'re hoping to facilitate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd any sort of decisions about how the continuation of those talks and any sort of agreement that could be produced by those talks about whether or not that\'s in the interest of those countries to pursue -- those are decisions that will be made by the leaders in those two countries, as it should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut certainly the United States will continue to play the role that we\xe2\x80\x99ve played for some time now in supporting reconciliation talks that are led by those individual countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, Secretary Kerry said earlier today that it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that some of the sanctions relief that Iran is getting will go to terrorist groups inside of Iran, but that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that yet.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could describe how or if the U.S. is tracking the money that\'s been unfrozen and going back to Iran, whether you\'re planning to do so going forward, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything you can do -- you\'re seeing that money go to groups that obviously pose some sort of security issue to the U.S. -- to kind of stop that, or if that would violate the terms of the nuclear agreement in any way.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a difficult question to answer primarily because I don\'t have much that I can say about any possible intelligence programs or intelligence capabilities that we may have here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the point that Secretary Kerry is making is that we know that Iran supports terrorist activities.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why they\'re on the list of the state sponsors of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 That is why there are a number of individuals and entities in Iran that are under significant financial sanctions by the United States and by the international community because they support terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States has chosen to confront this threat in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first and most important way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve confronted this threat is making sure that the government that supports terrorism doesn\'t have access to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s that essence of the agreement that was reached and successfully implemented over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we have tried to do is to work effectively with the international community, including at the United Nations Security Council, to counter this threat.\xc2\xa0 And we have found -- I would say not consistently, but certainly there have been important moments where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work effectively at the United Nations Security Council to demonstrate international opposition to terrorism and to governments that support terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have also sought to do is to build up the capacity of our allies and partners in the Middle East to mitigate the threat that is emanating from Iran -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the form of terrorism or other destabilizing activities that Iran engages in.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so one thing I can tell you is that there have been these talks between the United States and Israel about renewing the memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel when it comes to the security assistance that\'s provided by the United States.\xc2\xa0 Next week there will be another delegation of senior administration officials, including some White House officials, traveling to Israel to continue those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo obviously the President has made that a priority.\xc2\xa0 He said that when he was sitting in the Oval Office with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be a high priority for his team, and they\'re traveling there next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also continue to deepen our cooperation with our Gulf partners, as well.\xc2\xa0 And that work also continues.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re mindful of the risk that is posed by Iran and their support for terrorism and we\'re serious about confronting it.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just picking up on Iran, Secretary Kerry also made some comments about the Supreme Leader, essentially praising him for making statements that were critical of the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does the administration think the Supreme Leader is softening, turned over a new leaf?\xc2\xa0 Kind of surprised -- I never heard a Secretary of State kind of say positive things about the actions of the Supreme Leader of Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I think what is clear is that any government around the world, including the government of Iran has an obligation to provide security for diplomatic installations in their country.\xc2\xa0 And so when I was asked about this after there was this incident at the Saudi embassy inside of Iran, I noted with marked displeasure that Iran had not fulfilled their responsibilities to protect those embassies -- or to protect that embassy or those diplomatic institutions.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s a basic responsibility of any government, including the Iranian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to turning over a new leaf, as you described it, I don\'t think that\'s something that we\'re going to be able to judge based on three or four days of public statements after the implementation of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- most importantly, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve long said about the Iranian government, we\'re going to judge them by their actions.\xc2\xa0 And we will not do that based on any single action, but rather based on an observation over the long term about whether or not they want to start fulfilling their international obligations when it comes to things like their ballistic missile program or their support for terrorism, or start joining the rest of the free world in doing a better job of protecting the basic human rights of their people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is -- we\'re certainly going to be watching the actions of the Iranian government moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said a number of times, this nuclear agreement was not predicated on Iran improving their behavior.\xc2\xa0 Rather, this agreement was implemented primarily because of our concern about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then two other quick ones, entirely different subjects.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw, the ATF has reportedly identified a .50-caliber rifle that was found in El Chapo\xe2\x80\x99s hideout.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, the administration, frustrated -- from the Fast and Furious program -- is the administration frustrated to again see weapons from this program show up at crime scenes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I can tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually been able to confirm them independently, so let me take a look at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, more generally, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite concerned about the ease with which arms tend to flow across the border between the United States and Mexico.\xc2\xa0 And we have obviously worked -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to work with the Mexico government to try to shut down the flow of arms back and forth between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then I understand the President\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade had a slight delay given the snowstorm in Washington yesterday that was it about an inch or two?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They were not the only vehicles affected by the snow last night.\xc2\xa0 I can personally attest to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does the President have confidence in the city of Washington as this storm is about to hit?\xc2\xa0 And what are his plans for being snowed in here at the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if local officials -- what seems to be the case is that local officials were a little surprised by the amount of snow that the region received last night.\xc2\xa0 I feel confident, based on all the reporting that all of you are doing, that they will not be surprised about the amount of snow that will be hitting the region starting tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So it is clear -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen that Mayor Bowser has announced that a local snow emergency will begin tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 I think that is an indication that the city is taking this quite seriously and already beginning to mobilize the kinds of resources that will be needed to deal with what sounds like a pretty significant storm.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that that Governor McAuliffe and Governor Hogan have made similar announcements and are already beginning to make similar preparations.\xc2\xa0 Again, based on the forecast, it looks like we\'re going to need it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My guess is the President will stay warm and toasty here inside the White House.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be doing that a little bit, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one follow-up on that.\xc2\xa0 As a result of that motorcade, the President spent 74 minutes driving from Andrews to the White House -- longer than his usual commute.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any insight on what he did in terms of spending his time during that extra-long travel time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t have a chance to talk to Schultz about that.\xc2\xa0 I think what it probably was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s right there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think probably what it is, Juliet, is a reminder of how much the President is going to miss having access to Marine One a year from now.\xc2\xa0 He often talks about how that Marine One is something that makes his travel much more efficient and is something that -- helicopter travel is not something he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to have regular access to as a former President.\xc2\xa0 So last night may have been a reminder of how painful that transition could be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the question of the visa waiver policy that was just implemented, I was wondering if you could just talk a little about how the White House sees this compromise that was obviously struck with Congress, and if you could say anything about specifically how it affects dual nationals, which is certainly one of the key questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I spent a lot of time talking with our staff about this earlier today to try to understand exactly how this is implemented.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that there are a lot of complexities here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think there are a couple things I want to start out by saying because these are the real priorities.\xc2\xa0 The goal of this legislation that Congress passed at the end of last year was to improve and tighten the screening measures that were in place for those individuals that had recently traveled to countries that were the state sponsor of terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I guess I want to start there because, prior to that -- more than a year prior to that, the Department of Homeland Security had taken steps on more than one occasion using their own executive enforcement authority to actually tighten screening measures for individuals traveling to the United States through the visa waiver program.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that involved running more information through more databases and also collecting more information from travelers.\xc2\xa0 So the need to try to tighten these security requirements is something that has been a priority for the administration for more than a year before Congress acted.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously sought to work closely with Congress to develop some additional measures that Congress could pass.\xc2\xa0 And the legislation that passed reflected a compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about what that compromise is.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, this is what makes it complicated, Juliet, is that everyone shares the priority of protecting the homeland.\xc2\xa0 That\'s everyone\xe2\x80\x99s top priority, and I think that\'s something that -- that\'s one of the few things that transcends partisan differences here in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing, though, we want to be mindful of is we also want to be mindful of the fact that the United States has the strongest, most durable economy in the world in part because U.S. businesses do a lot of business overseas, particularly in visa waiver -- countries that are in the Visa Waiver Program.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re talking about a lot of traditional allies of the United States that are included in this program.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we want to make sure that we are doing everything that is necessary to keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0 That is the top priority.\xc2\xa0 But we also don\'t want to unnecessarily disadvantage American businesses that are trying to do business overseas, because ultimately that\'s good for our economy, it\'s good for creating jobs here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of -- consistent with those two goals in mind, there are some additional work that\'s already underway to try to work with members of Congress on refining the measure that was passed at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 And again, the goal here is to, number one, make sure that the country is safe and that we have in place appropriate screening for those individuals that have recently traveled to the nations of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria; but at the same time, we don\'t want to undermine the ability of U.S. businesses to interact with and to do business with partners or counterparts in countries like the UK, France, Germany, and other countries in Europe that are allies of the United States, that are part of the Visa Waiver Program.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I guess the last thing I just want to be clear about is the restrictions that were put in place both by the administration and by Congress over the last year and a half do not prevent individuals from traveling to the United States.\xc2\xa0 What they do is they subject individuals that have recently traveled to these countries to more screening.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an important thing for people to understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there anything you can say specifically about dual nationals, just because there seems to be a little uncertainty about how that\'s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s a good example of how we feel the system can be improved.\xc2\xa0 So let me give you one example. In some cases, there may be individuals who are dual nationals -- so one example, somebody who was born in France, so is a French citizen, but was born to a parent who was an Iranian citizen -- therefore that individual is a dual national.\xc2\xa0 And even though that individual has never traveled to Iran -- just to use one example -- they would be subjected to additional screening measures because of their status as a dual national.\xc2\xa0 And our view is that that is something that could be refined to ensure that our screening system is applied in a way that prioritizes national security but also makes the system as efficient as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that.\xc2\xa0 DHS has left some room to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for people whose travel was for humanitarian purposes.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism from Congressman Goodlatte that that\'s -- you\'re stretching a loophole that was supposed to be smaller.\xc2\xa0 Can you just talk about the balance you\'re trying to strike?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this sort of falls under the realm of common sense, too.\xc2\xa0 The other example that we\'ve used, Scott, that may I think resonate some more in this room is with journalists.\xc2\xa0 Journalists who traveled to Iraq, for example, to cover the Iraq war, those are individuals who don\'t pose as much of a risk as other individuals for whom the system was designed.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, we have talked for a long time about the threat that is posed by foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals -- fortunately it\'s a relatively small number of Americans who have traveled to Iraq or Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the concern that we have is that there are individuals who hold Western passports.\xc2\xa0 And we want to know if they\xe2\x80\x99re planning to travel back to the United States, and in some cases, we may not want them to travel back to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so here is the broader concern.\xc2\xa0 The number of U.S. citizens who have made that trip is relatively small, but we know that there are other countries, including in Europe, where the number is substantially larger.\xc2\xa0 And these are countries with whom the United States participates in the Visa Waiver Program.\xc2\xa0 And so the concern is that an individual who is a European citizen, has traveled, fought with ISIL, and now may want to use that Western passport to enter the United States with very little screening -- that is the situation that we want to try to prevent.\xc2\xa0 And that is the goal of these measures.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s obviously much different than a journalist or an aid worker or somebody who has traveled as a part of a regional or some national government -- someone who had traveled for official government purposes.\xc2\xa0 And so the more that we can try to draw those distinctions -- again, which makes implementing the law extraordinarily complex, but we also want to make sure that we\'re doing this in a way that reflects our most urgent national security concerns and reflects the economic realities of the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Guantanamo, I understand you laid out the public disclosure, but can you tell us internally where the President is in his review of Secretary Carter\xe2\x80\x99s proposals to shut down the prison?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Pentagon has been working on putting this report together for a number of months now.\xc2\xa0 Part of this report included some site visits that were made by Department of Defense personnel to a couple detention facilities around the United States to evaluate the security measures that were in place and to evaluate whether or not these were places where Gitmo detainees could potentially be transferred.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, their work has primarily been focused on developing some of those kinds of options and trying to put some hard numbers around the fiscal impact of closing the prison.\xc2\xa0 Part of our case has been that taxpayers can save some money.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a responsibility that we all have, is to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 The longstanding concern that the President has -- and this is a concern that is shared by Democrats and Republicans, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s Republican predecessor -- that we know that terrorist organizations continue to use the prison at Guantanamo Bay in their recruiting materials.\xc2\xa0 And effectively closing the prison is one way that we can make it harder for extremist organizations to recruit people to their cause.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo both for that obvious national security reason, but also for fiscal reasons, that\'s the reason that the President promised seven years ago tomorrow to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and it\'s why every day since, his administration has made that a national security priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think all of what I have laid out also underscores why there\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise ending to the report.\xc2\xa0 I think those of you who have covered this closely -- and I think most people in this room have -- you understand what our strategy is here.\xc2\xa0 And the development of a plan is not an attempt to implement a radically different strategy, but rather to provide some more texture and detail about the benefits of the strategy that we\'re pursuing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to take a look at that when the report is completed and presented to Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s in the final stages?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as I mentioned earlier, when I was first asked about this over the summer, in July, I noted that the plan was to present the report to Congress \xe2\x80\x9cvery soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, so I just don\'t want to be in a position of making additional promises about timing that, frankly, I\'ve already broken.\xc2\xa0 So when we have additional details about that, then once the plan has been presented to Congress we\'ll make sure you all have an opportunity to take a look at it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to you on Iran?\xc2\xa0 There are some questions -- and I understand you can\'t talk about where the monies that have been released have gone and hypotheticals like that.\xc2\xa0 But the Secretary specifically said -- Secretary Kerry -- \xe2\x80\x9cI think some of the money will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with the Secretary of State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He began by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d and I think that reflects his I think rather logical conclusion that a nation that supports terrorism may use some of the money that\'s coming into the country to further support terrorism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the thing that\'s important for people to recognize is that critics of this agreement often exaggerate the sanctions -- the value of the sanctions relief that Iran will obtain, and they often overlook the rather severe economic priorities that are badly underfunded inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of bills that are already past due that Iran needs to pay.\xc2\xa0 There are significant investments in their infrastructure that also need to be made because they are already having an impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve seen at least one economic analysis that indicates that Iran is not going to immediately bring all of the available money into the country because it would have the effect of artificially appreciating their currency, which would further weaken their economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I guess that is why we have been pretty honest about the fact that this agreement is not going to resolve all of our concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s bad behavior, and it is entirely likely and I think it is even expected that Iran will continue to support terrorism.\xc2\xa0 But because of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s intention that we assess to continue to support terrorism, that\'s what makes it so important that we prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, that\'s not just a case that we\'ve made.\xc2\xa0 This is also the case that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, himself, has made.\xc2\xa0 He, himself, made it a priority, I think for very good reason, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the President concluded that the best way to do that is through a diplomatic agreement like the one that we\'ve recently implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s motivating this action.\xc2\xa0 And it is why the implementation of this agreement was one that we celebrated, because it did represent substantial steps that Iran had to take to scale back significantly their nuclear program, and to cooperate with the kinds of international inspections that will verify that they\xe2\x80\x99re not developing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And those are kinds -- that is access and that is a change in their nuclear program that could not be achieved through military action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To be clear, what you\'re saying is while some may conclude, and it would be logical to conclude, that some monies may flow to groups like terrorists -- and you think you could mitigate the threat -- but you do say it could flow there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve been candid about that possibility, and that assessment is drawn from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And again, that longstanding support for terrorism is what motivated us to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s also what motivates us in part to ramp up our efforts to provide additional support to our closest ally in the region, Israel, and to seek to better integrate the defense and security capabilities of our Gulf partners as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a totally different note -- on the President\xe2\x80\x99s commute home on the treacherous roads that were not necessarily plowed or salted and all the rest, were there some security concerns that he was sitting on the road for 74 minutes in traffic, where others are swerving and having accidents all around him?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\'t there some serious safety concern around that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that these kinds of road conditions pose a hazard to everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s on the roads.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the President was being driven in a heavy SUV with a highly trained professional driver at the wheel, and surrounded by a number of other vehicles as well.\xc2\xa0 The assessment that was made by the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, including the military and Secret Service, is that driving home from Andrews would be much safer than flying home from Andrews in a helicopter.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s security when he travels is a top priority and that\'s what led them to choose to drive home from Andrews last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh. The ICIG has been in the news a little bit of late, and I just wanted to ask you how would you characterize the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of confidence in the Intelligence Community\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, these kinds of reviews that are conducted by inspectors general are done independent of the administration.\xc2\xa0 The decisions to pursue a particular review and the results of those reviews that are presented to Capitol Hill or made public are entirely decisions made independent of the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s hard for me to pass judgment on them one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it\'s the responsibility of the inspector general to describe what he or she is doing and to explain why it\'s part of their scope of responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you would agree that the President values that position, because if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t value that position there wouldn\'t be one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say is, in principle, the President does believe that independent inspectors general who fulfill their responsibilities consistent with the law are an important part of holding government in general accountable to the taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an important position.\xc2\xa0 But because of the independence of the inspector general at the Intelligence Community, I don\'t want to be in a position of rendering a judgment one way or another about the decisions that are made by that individual or the office that they run.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, the American public will have to arrive at their own conclusions about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can just say that, in general, the administration is quite strongly supportive of the principle of having independent oversight of the government, primarily because of the obligation that we have to taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then, can you think of another example in history of someone with the stature and the experience of Secretary Clinton publically criticizing such a position -- a leader in that position -- in a way that she did recently, and basically accusing this high-ranking official of colluding with a political party to influence an election?\xc2\xa0 Can you think of another example of this happening to anyone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I can say is this, is I think that while people who have a position like I do have a responsibility of protecting the independence of the inspectors general in the administration.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the reasons I try not to comment on them too much, is because I don\'t even want to leave you with the appearance of trying to influence some of their activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility on the part of the inspectors general themselves as well to avoid both in deed and in appearance actions that would be carried out to politically benefit one side or the other, or one party or another.\xc2\xa0 And so that responsibility -- the responsibility to protect the independence of the inspector general is certainly one that I take seriously.\xc2\xa0 And the inspectors general should do the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And rightly so.\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t this unprecedented, that a former Secretary of State, for example, would accuse someone at that level of essentially colluding with a political party to try and influence an election?\xc2\xa0 That seems extraordinary if nothing else.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I will leave it to all of you to sort of assess the actions of the inspector general.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if this latest report that\'s been the subject of a number of news stories is something that\'s been made public yet, but when it is, obviously the American public will have the opportunity to evaluate for themselves whether or not the decisions that were made by the inspector general were appropriately independent and unbiased and consistent with their responsibility to be looking out for taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I give you a good run at this one on the EPA situation in Flint.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been looking at a number of different stories that have sort of gone through a tick-tock from February when a tester originally raised the issue, then again confirmed it in April, then again sent a memo in June, and yet it\'s been now into January these people have been drinking this contaminated water.\xc2\xa0 The process seems to have played out very slowly and, frankly, in a dangerous way for the people of Flint.\xc2\xa0 What is your assessment of the process?\xc2\xa0 Did the EPA get it right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, there are a number of factors here that are important to consider.\xc2\xa0 The first is, and state officials have acknowledged this, that it is state and local officials inside of Flint who are primarily responsible for the safety of the water supply in Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Primarily, but not solely, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President acknowledged yesterday is that we need to take a look at the relationship that EPA has with state and local governments across the country to make sure that that process doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impede unnecessarily the ability of the EPA to present information that may have a significant impact on the health and safety of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s one of the things that the President talked about in his conversation with the EPA Administrator earlier this week, is to take a look at the procedures in place and determine if we need to make some changes to those procedures to make sure that if the EPA is aware of information that could have a direct impact on the health and safety of the American public, that they\xe2\x80\x99re not somehow prevented from sharing that information with the public.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s an important principle.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that this underscores is the value of -- or the role of government in keeping us safe and protecting our health.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty vigorous debate going on on the campaign trail right now about the proper role of government.\xc2\xa0 But I think this highlights the fact that there is a role to play to protect our public health and safety and to keep our water clean and to keep our air clean.\xc2\xa0 And we also need to make sure that we\'re holding that government accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree then that the EPA was prevented from alerting the public to the danger in Flint?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what is true is that there continues to be an ongoing investigation, including one that\'s led by the Department of Justice, about what exactly transpired in the months since the water supply -- or the source of the water in the city of Flint was transferred from one source to another.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\'t want to get out ahead of that investigation by sort of commenting one way or another about the propriety of the actions that were taken by state and local officials or by the EPA.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the President believes that the principle of accountability is important, particularly when the stakes are this high.\xc2\xa0 And the President does want to make sure, and will make sure, that if there were errors or wrongdoing that was carried out by officials at the EPA that they\xe2\x80\x99re held accountable for those actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you mentioned earlier that you spent a bit of time preparing for the -- Visa Waiver Program.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a lot of questions are being raised about just how dual nationality is going to be applied.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if the administration is anticipating problems and implementation of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think based on the exchange that I had with Juliet and Scott, it\'s apparent that implementing this law is complex.\xc2\xa0 And I think the thing that we want to be sure of is that complexities associated with implementing this law do not affect our ability to keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen DHS and the State Department enter into a rigorous process here in evaluating the law and determining the most effective way to implement it.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be rigorous as they implement the law moving forward, because keeping the American people safe is our top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And where does fair and equitable treatment factor into that in terms of -- there are obviously a lot of people upset who feel that they are already being unfairly targeted.\xc2\xa0 So where does the White House see that balance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that is a balance that we believe could more effectively struck by refining the law that was passed at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 What you saw at the end of last year was Democrats and Republicans work together in a good-faith effort to find a compromise for imposing tighter screening on individuals from Visa Waiver countries who had recently traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria.\xc2\xa0 The administration, for a couple of years, has been focused on tightening the screening that was in place because we were mindful of the threat that was posed by foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 Congress weighed in, as they appropriately should.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is clear in our view is that there are some refinements to the program that we make it more effective.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to try to work together with Democrats and Republicans in the same spirit that allowed us to pass these reforms in the first place at the end of last year to try to pass some refinements to the program that we believe would make it more effective.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can just one more, to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade and the upcoming storm.\xc2\xa0 The President, back in 2009, when school was cancelled for Sasha and Malia, had some comments that some Washingtonians --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFlinty\xe2\x80\x9d was the word he used, I think.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 They were somewhat disparaging to the personal nature of people who live in this city, and I wonder if he still thinks that Washington needs to toughen up.\xc2\xa0 And more broadly, what\xe2\x80\x99s the role of the federal government in all of this, if it\xe2\x80\x99s as bad as they\xe2\x80\x99re predicting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I think is clear is that local officials here last night were dealing with a pretty difficult situation, that the amount of snow that was received was not, on its own, significant, but based on the amount of snow exceeding expectations and coming right at the onset of the evening rush hour, it made dealing with the surprise rather challenging.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that 18 to 24 inches of snow would be a challenge to any metropolitan area in the United States -- certainly one like the Washington, D.C. area that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have as much experience dealing with situations like this as the city of Boston does, for example.\xc2\xa0 But the President is confident that the local leaders in the area -- Governor Hogan, Governor McAuliffe and Mayor Bowser -- are all appropriately attuned to the risk and of the forecasts, and are taking the kinds of precautions they need to take to keep the country -- or keep the citizens of the Mid-Atlantic region safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any federal conversation on standby?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific federal request for assistance that had been made at this point.\xc2\xa0 But if there are ways that we can offer up some assistance, then I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, does the White House consult with OPM about when to let federal workers in the area go home tomorrow or whether they need to come to work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 OPM does have a regimented process in place where they consult with a variety of government agencies, and they consult with other local officials as well, both in D.C., Virginia and Maryland, but also at Metro, to evaluate the impact of the weather on the variety of modes of transportation here in the city.\xc2\xa0 So the process will run as it normally does.\xc2\xa0 They will look at the latest weather forecast, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they are hoping for additional information about when the storm is expected to begin here, or the effects of the storm will begin to be felt here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly will have a significant impact on the decision that they make tomorrow about -- or the decision that they will make either tonight or first thing in the morning about the operating status of the federal government tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Flint.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House willing to reconsider Governor Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s request to reconsider issuing a disaster declaration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark, there\xe2\x80\x99s a formal process for evaluating those requests, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that officials at FEMA will do their due diligence on this.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned earlier in the week, the case that Governor Snyder has to make, even based on my own layman\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the law, is not a strong one, simply because the statute says that that kind of designation can only be used for essentially natural disasters or acts of God.\xc2\xa0 And the tragedy that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Flint is a manmade crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is already significant assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s been provided by FEMA.\xc2\xa0 There was an emergency declaration that the President issued earlier this week that freed up $5 million in assistance for Flint.\xc2\xa0 But the truth is, FEMA had actually been on the ground in Flint prior to that request for emergency assistance, providing some logistical support and providing bottled water that was drawn from stockpiles that FEMA maintains.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the same subject.\xc2\xa0 It can be frustrating for people not just in Flint but around the country to hear things like, well, local and state authorities are primarily responsible for that -- when the EPA is really supposed to be kind of the gatekeeper to make sure that things like that aren\xe2\x80\x99t happening, especially when they knew about it.\xc2\xa0 And when you say this shows the value of the role of government, but this seems to be the ultimate example of government failing at every single level, when most people would consider the primary -- the very basic role of the government, what their money goes to, is to protect them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow we know, based on the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s own admission, that they could have done things faster, that they did know about this. We heard some strong words from the President on it briefly, though, yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is this not enormously concerning to the administration that the EPA very clearly knew about it and didn\xe2\x80\x99t alert the public?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about long-term contamination here.\xc2\xa0 It just seems like the way it\xe2\x80\x99s described it\xe2\x80\x99s very -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that in the public view it really matches the level of emotion that people feel when they see this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I think that there are some more facts that need to be learned to substantiate all of the claims of responsibility that were included in your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on its face, we know that the EPA knew about it.\xc2\xa0 We know that the EPA did not alert the public.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough to know that this was a big failure on the part of the EPA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 There is more information that needs to be learned.\xc2\xa0 But what the President has been quite clear about -- and I think the President was pretty blunt in talking about his reaction to this situation -- as a parent, as he mentioned yesterday, he\xe2\x80\x99d be beside himself if he knew that the water that he\xe2\x80\x99d been giving to his child was poisoning them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an outrage that something like that would happen in the greatest country in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the question is, essentially -- there are a number of questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, what do we do to make sure that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s not happening in other places?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, because we know in this situation that state and local officials had primary responsibility for the safety and integrity of the water system in Flint, what are the guiding principles for the way that the EPA interacts with state and local officials who are themselves responsible for the health and safety of people who are drinking the water in their communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President wants to get to the bottom of that, and he wants to get to the bottom of that quickly.\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want a situation where the EPA is unnecessarily obstructed from being able to share information with the public that has a direct impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of the public.\xc2\xa0 So the President certainly has that concern, and the President has made clear to his EPA administrator that he is concerned that this is not happening anywhere else.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second things is, we should be take a look at the actions that were taken at the EPA.\xc2\xa0 And if there were individuals who made mistakes, or did not do their job appropriately, then there should be some accountability.\xc2\xa0 The President is quite serious about that as well.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re also gratified to see that the state and local officials -- again, who are primarily responsible for water supply in Flint -- are taking a similar posture.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s to their credit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also important is that the federal government is doing what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to assist state and local officials as they respond to this situation.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned to Mark the steps that FEMA has taken to try to enhance their response by providing some bottled water and some logistical support.\xc2\xa0 The President has tapped the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead -- or to coordinate the federal efforts to support the state and local response.\xc2\xa0 He tapped that individual because there clearly is a significant public health problem here, and so having somebody with that kind of expertise to coordinate the federal assistance is important.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me say the last thing.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the role of government, the President does believe that the government needs to be held accountable, and government does have a basic responsibility for the health and safety of the American people, particularly when it comes to keeping our air and water clean.\xc2\xa0 I think that, in some ways, this situation underscores the danger of the approach that is advocated by some Republicans of doing things like eliminating the EPA.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t seem like a very smart thing to do either.\xc2\xa0 And I think the consequences of something like that are on full display in Flint, Michigan right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\'re talking about this as this -- I don\'t know mega-monster storm, whatever we\'re calling it -- is barreling down on us.\xc2\xa0 And the President slipped and slid in his own motorcade after what about an inch of snow fell, and that prompted an apology by the mayor of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital the next day.\xc2\xa0 Does that bode okay for how the Eastern Seaboard is going to handle this several feet of snow?\xc2\xa0 Do you have real concerns about that?\xc2\xa0 I think it kind of seemed like a bad omen this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is clear is that local officials were caught a little off guard last night.\xc2\xa0 And I think the likelihood that they are caught off guard in advance of this significant storm is quite low.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken significant steps to prepare for the oncoming storm.\xc2\xa0 And I think the advice that we would share with people is the advice you hear me offer up quite frequently, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to listen to the mayor and for emergency officials here in the area for steps they should take in advance of the storm to prepare for it.\xc2\xa0 And if they do that, then even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a record storm, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to all weather it together.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My apologies.\xc2\xa0 Now that the Litvinenko report is out, based on what is in there, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a legal process that came to that conclusion, based on what has been shared between the U.S. and Britain, based on U.S. intelligence, does the administration share that assessment that President Putin probably had a role in this killing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the evidence that we have seen that was put forward by the British government is pretty compelling.\xc2\xa0 But we have not thoroughly reviewed the report to draw our own conclusions at this point.\xc2\xa0 But once we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions on how Iran -- or predictions about how Iran might spend the cash gleaned from sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s emerged that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s budget for next year, there is going to be a 15 percent increase in funding for the Revolutionary Guards, and a doubling of intelligence spending.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to revisit your assumptions about how they might spend the money that they\'re getting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the only assumption that we have made about how they intend to spend the money was based on the observation from the Secretary of State that it certainly seems possible if not likely that they will use some of those funds to support acts of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 That possibility certainly exists.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is precisely why we have implemented an agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 As dangerous as their ongoing support for terrorism is, it would be even more dangerous -- even catastrophic if Iran had access to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And they don\'t right now because we successfully implemented this agreement that caused them to dismantle thousands of centrifuges, to ship out 98 percent of their enriched uranium stockpile, and to agree to a whole set of intrusive inspections that will verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement, and verify that they\'re not actively working to build a nuclear weapon, that their nuclear program exists solely for peaceful purposes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the goal of this agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re going to continue to have significant concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, particularly when it comes to supporting terrorism, developing a ballistic missile program, or even threatening Israel, our close ally in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'re going to continue to take steps to further isolate Iran for any sort of continued efforts they make with regard to those things.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why on Saturday, even as we were -- or Sunday, even as we were announcing the completion of this agreement, the Treasure Department was announcing an additional round of sanctions that would be imposed on those individuals who are connected in one way or another to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile program because Iran continues to engage in activities that are in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions that govern their missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think our approach to this has been quite realistic and quite consistent with achieving our top priority which is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- rather more specific about your assumptions on what Iran would do with the cash.\xc2\xa0 You said today and administration officials have said repeatedly that you think that a good proportion of the money will go toward propping up the riyal, towards building infrastructure, towards addressing some of the more fundamental macroeconomic issues that exist in Iran.\xc2\xa0 And it looks like that might not be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see exactly what happens.\xc2\xa0 And I think the observations that we have made are that -- at least that some have made -- I don\'t know that this is an official government conclusion, but there is reason to doubt why it would not make good economic sense for them to immediately bring all of the money that will be made available to them back into Iran because it would cause the currency to artificially appreciate in a way that could further damage their already weakened economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe same thing applies to a number of bills that have come due.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of infrastructure projects that Iran has engaged in but not paid for.\xc2\xa0 And their creditors are going to be interested in collecting the money that they\'re owed.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also know that the state of the Iranian economy has been significantly weakened by these international sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And that after all is what pressured them to come to the negotiating table in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Iran is going to have to use at least some of that money to address those economic weaknesses.\xc2\xa0 And again, the reason that Iran was compelled to the negotiating table is because -- is quite obviously driven by their concerns about the state of the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we know that there has been an ongoing commitment inside of Iran to supporting terrorism.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think they came to the negotiating table so they could get access to more money to carry out acts of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 They came to the negotiating table because they were concerned about the economic pressure that was being applied to their country and the impact that could have on their domestic political situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo ultimately the government of Iran is going to have to make their own decisions about how they use the money.\xc2\xa0 But I think that there are a lot of reasonable assumptions based on our knowledge of their economy, and based on our knowledge of basic economic principles like how currency is -- the value of currency is affected by significant flows of cash, but also affected by our knowledge of their ongoing support for terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think the administration has been quite realistic about what our priorities are and what our expectations are out of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And again, for those who say that our concern should principally be about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism, we agree.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly why the President did as much as possibly can be done to verify and to prevent Iran from obtaining an nuclear weapon because a nuclear-armed Iran that supports terrorism would be very dangerous to the United States and to allies in the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to such great lengths to prevent that from happening.\xc2\xa0 And all of that was accomplished without the United States having to wage another land war in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is why the President noted over the weekend that the implementation of this agreement is something that can and should be celebrated here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Good luck with snow tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You going to brief, Josh?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what OPM decides.\xc2\xa0 If the government is closed, we will not have a briefing.\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s open, we will.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on the rest of the schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:37 P.M.
