Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:52 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of announcements to do at the top, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions. \xc2\xa0This morning, the President was briefed by his top Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco, about preparations that are underway for the possible landfall of Hurricane Joaquin. \xc2\xa0FEMA, through its regional offices in Atlanta, Philadelphia and New York, continues to monitor Hurricane Joaquin, and remains in close contact with state, tribal and local officials up and down the Eastern Seaboard.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough there have been no requests for federal Stafford Act assistance, FEMA continues to stand ready to assist states and tribes as needed and as requested. \xc2\xa0At all times, FEMA maintains commodities, including millions of liters of water, millions of meals, and hundreds of thousands of blankets strategically located at distribution centers throughout the United States and its territories. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence -- or maybe it is a coincidence -- that today is the final day of National Preparedness Month. \xc2\xa0And the storm in the Atlantic serves as a reminder that we all must take action to prepare now, and throughout the year, for the types of emergencies that could affect us where we will, where we work, and where we visit. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn any emergency it\xe2\x80\x99s always important to follow the instructions provided by state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management officials. \xc2\xa0FEMA encourages all Americans to visit Ready.gov, or Listo.gov, to learn more about how to be prepared and how to protect your families during emergencies. \xc2\xa0That seems particularly important today for those of us that live in the Mid-Atlantic.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about emergency response, it seems also appropriate that we would have in our thoughts and prayers our first responders. \xc2\xa0And on Sunday, October 4th -- this coming Sunday -- the President will travel to Emmitsburg, Maryland to deliver remarks at the 34th National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. \xc2\xa0The President will honor 84 heroic firefighters who died in the line of duty in 2014, and three other firefighters who died in previous years. \xc2\xa0The President looks forward to thanking our nation\xe2\x80\x99s firefighters for the extraordinary courage they display every day, particularly during these challenging times as communities across the Western United States combat the recent outbreak of wildfires that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen there.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Emmitsburg and his participation in that solemn event in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all that, Josh, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Some foreign policy topics for you today. \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. know who Russia is targeting with airstrikes in Syria at the moment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, the Department of Defense is obviously reviewing the ongoing Russian military activity inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when President Obama and President Putin had the opportunity to meet just two days ago, both Presidents agreed that it was a priority for both countries that tactical, practical conversations between our militaries take place to ensure that our military activities inside of Syria are properly de-conflicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat continues to be a priority. \xc2\xa0The U.S. military officials have been in touch with their Russian counterparts already to set up those discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But Russia says they\xe2\x80\x99re going after ISIS. \xc2\xa0We see reports coming from the region that other groups are being struck, including Nusra and even a U.S.-backed rebel group, which would, at least the way you\xe2\x80\x99ve described it in the past, mark a larger effort by Putin to try and shore up Assad\xe2\x80\x99s government, not to simply go after extremists like the Islamic State that we share a mutual goal of ousting. \xc2\xa0So what do you make of the fact that it seems like they\xe2\x80\x99re bombing in areas that are not necessarily ISIS-held, and could be expanding this military operation to really try and shore up the Assad regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the Department of Defense is going to take a look at the Russian military activities there. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s too early for me to say exactly what targets they were aiming at and what targets were eventually hit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess, do you take Putin at his word that he\xe2\x80\x99s only going after the Islamic State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the Department of Defense will take a look at the Russian military activities in Syria, and they may have more information to share about that in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour question, though, does raise I think something that warrants mentioning here at the outset -- which is we are seeing the Russians ramp up their support for President Assad. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve been supporting him for quite some time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a significant military investment now in further propping him up. \xc2\xa0The fact that Russia has to take these noteworthy steps to ramp up their support for Assad is an indication of how concerned they are about losing influence in the one client state that they have in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is in contrast to -- or at least calls into question their strategy, because when President Putin and President Obama had to the opportunity to meet at the U.N. earlier this week, much of their discussion was focused on the need for a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Now, there are well-known differences of opinion about what that transition looks like, but there was agreement on both parts about the need for a political solution to the problems that are plaguing Syria. \xc2\xa0That means Russia will not succeed in imposing a military solution on Syria any more than the United States was successful in imposing a military solution on Iraq a decade ago, and certainly no more than Russia was able to impose a military solution on Afghanistan three decades ago. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this goes to the case that the President made in his speech at the U.N. on Monday, which is that to confront these significant global challenges, nations around the world can exercise strength and exercise influence by being part of a large international effort to address those challenges. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what the United States is doing inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0The President is leading a coalition of now 65 countries that are implementing an integrated strategy that includes a robust military effort but also includes efforts to try to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s online radicalization efforts, shut down the flow of foreign fighters, engage in efforts to counter their financing efforts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is part of -- that is the most effective way for the United States to lead the international community. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also the most effective way for us to advance U.S. interests in the region and around the world. \xc2\xa0It also is the most effective way for us to eventually arrive at the kind of solution to the significant problems that are plaguing that war-torn country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In Afghanistan, amid a new setback in Kunduz, military commanders from the U.S. are recommending that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see additional troops remain in Afghanistan beyond that small presence at the embassy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past. \xc2\xa0Does the President agree with those recommendations and is that something that he\xe2\x80\x99s actively considering?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, let me start by saying that the United States continues to monitor efforts by the Afghan national defense and security forces to retake Kunduz. \xc2\xa0U.S. and coalition forces are providing advisory support and have conducted a limited number of airstrikes, primarily for the purposes of force protection.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States will continue to work closely with President Ghani, the rest of the Afghan government, and our international partners to ensure that Afghan forces have the capabilities and training necessary to preserve the gains that have been made by the Afghans and the international community over the last 13 years. \xc2\xa0When it comes to policy decisions, I think there -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of news to make in this regard. \xc2\xa0But there are two observations that I have. \xc2\xa0The first is that the President, when announcing these decisions in the past when it comes to our military commitment to Afghanistan, has routinely noted that the conditions on the ground influence that policy process. \xc2\xa0And so I would expect that that would be the case in this circumstance as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, we have always warned against the inclination to essentially make snap decisions on policy almost literally overnight. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to monitor the efforts by the Afghan government and Afghan security forces to retake Kunduz, and that will factor into a longer-term assessment of the conditions on the ground, which will influence longer-term policy decisions that the President will have to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President received those recommendations from commanders in any kind of a formal way as of this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of the kind of communication between the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders on the ground, but as you know, Josh, the President does receive regular briefings and regular updates from his military commanders through the chain of command. \xc2\xa0And that certainly will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And at the United Nations today, Palestinian President Abbas said he is no longer bound by agreements with Israel; they\xe2\x80\x99re going to start pursuing legal means to pursue Palestinian statehood and are basically abandoning the direct-negotiations approach that has been your position for a very long time now. \xc2\xa0So what is the U.S. response to the Palestinians dismissing that approach?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I believe that Prime Minister Abbas was speaking -- or President Abbas was speaking right as I walked out here. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any direct response to what he has said. \xc2\xa0I will just say as a general matter that the United States has long been and continues today to be committed to achieving peace that the Palestinians and Israelis deserve. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve described the resolution of this conflict as a two-state solution that results in two states for two peoples, with a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with a Jewish and democratic Israel. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s been our position for quite some time, and that continues to be our position today.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Going back to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in Syria, you just told Josh that the Defense Department is reviewing those actions. \xc2\xa0The Deputy Defense Secretary told lawmakers on the Hill today that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s move was \xe2\x80\x9calarming and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d and had come before discussions that they were promised to have on de-conflicting. \xc2\xa0Is that same level of surprise being shared by the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\'t see those particular comments. \xc2\xa0I think what is clear is that we have known for quite some time -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m including all of you -- because we\xe2\x80\x99ve had active public discussions in here about the significant deployment of military assets and personnel by the Russians into Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly surprising that Russia is using those new military capabilities, particularly in light of their longstanding efforts to prop up the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And in light of the continuing weakness of the Assad regime, in terms of their ability to control territory inside that country, the Russians felt that they need to ramp up their efforts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason that -- I think the second data point that I would remind you of is that there\xe2\x80\x99s also a reason that both President Putin and President Obama have prioritized and agreed on the need for operational, tactical-level conversations to de-conflict military operations inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to have conversations to de-conflict military activities inside of Syria if you didn\'t have plans for military operations inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is that U.S. military officials have been in touch with their Russian counterparts to set up those conversations, and I would expect that those conversations would take place in short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, yes, President Obama and President Putin discussed the need for conversations to de-conflict. \xc2\xa0But during that hour-and-a-half conversation they had at the United Nations, did anything -- did President Obama get any kind of indication from President Putin about the timing of these strikes, or the targets? \xc2\xa0Or was this something left completely off the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I would say is that there was not an operational-level conversation in the meeting between the two Presidents. \xc2\xa0Those operational conversations were the kinds of conversations that both Presidents expect their military officials to engage in. \xc2\xa0And like I said, the United States has been in touch with Russian military officials to begin those tactical, practical-level conversations to ensure that our military activities and Russian military activities are properly de-conflicted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question. \xc2\xa0On the Hill yesterday, lawmakers reached a compromise on the annual defense authorization bill. \xc2\xa0And they have it so that it would use $90 billion believe from special war funds to avoid sequestration. \xc2\xa0Would the White House oppose this bill on the grounds that it would end sequestration for defense but not other programs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that we would oppose the bill for the reasons that you have described because that\'s an irresponsible way to fund our national defense priorities. \xc2\xa0Even Republicans in Congress have referred to this is as a \xe2\x80\x9cslush fund.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So this is not a partisan response. \xc2\xa0In fact, we know that this is actually a view that is shared by some Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d also point to you -- direct you to the statement that was released by the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed, a West Point graduate from Rhode Island. \xc2\xa0And according to his news release, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are many needed reforms in the committee conference report, but the use of emergency war funds does not realistically provide for the long-term support of our forces.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Senator Reed continued saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sign this conference report because it fails to responsibly fix the sequestration and provide our troops with the support that they deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe position that\'s articulated by Senator Reed is the position that President Obama has advocated, as well. \xc2\xa0That\'s why if the President got this bill he\xe2\x80\x99d veto.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99d veto it. \xc2\xa0Okay, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around. \xc2\xa0Justin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a quick one on Russia. \xc2\xa0Based on your language, is it fair to say that the U.S. wasn\xe2\x80\x99t given -- or didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any of these de-conflicting conversations, or conversations about coordination before the airstrikes began?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is fair to say that U.S. officials had already been in touch with their Russian counterparts to set up those meetings. \xc2\xa0But it is accurate to say that those de-confliction conversations have not yet occurred, though I would expect that they will begin in short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And when those conversations start, is it merely going to be Russia or the U.S. saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe plan to act in this area, so keep your military interests out and safe,\xe2\x80\x9d or will there be any sort of coordination of efforts between the U.S. and Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to prejudge at this point exactly what those conversations look like other than that they will abide by the description that I have used here for a couple of weeks now -- that these will be tactical, practical-level conversations. \xc2\xa0And we have long said that we would welcome constructive Russian contributions to our counter-ISIL campaign, so I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out any coordination; we would welcome Russian coordination. \xc2\xa0But the purpose of the conversations is to ensure that our military activities and the military activities of our coalition partners are effectively and safely de-conflicted from any military operations that the Russians may be planning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to shift over to the budget. \xc2\xa0There were some reports on Capitol Hill yesterday that the President had spoken to leaders from both parties about the possibility of a longer-term budget deal that could happen over the next month before Speaker Boehner leaves. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk kind of detailing the conversations of what your guys\xe2\x80\x99 goals for those talks are, what the parameters of the deal that you guys and the congressional leaders are looking for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the kinds of conversations that we are interested in having are conversations that prevent a government shutdown and conversations that ensure that our national security and economic priorities are adequately funded, which means that Congress needs to arrive at the kind of bipartisan budget agreement that was reached by Senator Murray and Chairman Paul Ryan from the House that essentially raised the sequester caps to ensure that those priorities were adequately funded.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what the President made clear -- has made clear at every turn, and is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear -- what the President has made clear at every turn in his private conversations is something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say many times in public, which is that Republicans have not succeeded and will not succeed in passing budget legislation strictly along party lines. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve tried that countless times now. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough unity within the Republican caucus to advance legislation like that. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s even evident when you take a look at the vote that we expect to see in the House of Representatives for a clean CR to prevent a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0Hopefully that will happen today.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what that means is it means that Republicans are going to need to work with Democrats in Congress to pass compromise legislation. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have insisted at every turn that if Republicans in Congress are interested in negotiations, then they should walk over to Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s office and to Leader Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s office, and accept their invitation to engage in bipartisan negotiations. \xc2\xa0Any effort to circumvent Senator Reid and Leader Pelosi will ultimately fail because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- Republicans are going to need the support of Democrats in the House and the Senate in order to pass this legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, on that point specifically, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate with Democrats; they want to negotiate with the President directly. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is not the leader of the House of Representatives, and the President, he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the leader of the Senate, either. \xc2\xa0There are elected representatives of the House Democratic caucus and the Senate Democratic caucus, and of course the administration has influence in those two caucuses, and the kind of highly functioning working relationship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with those caucuses have been able to advance critical pieces of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. \xc2\xa0But, ultimately, while the administration will certainly be involved in these budget discussions, Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi and their support is going to be necessary to get this done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why do you think Senator McConnell only wants to work through the White House? \xc2\xa0Have you guys indicated that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to consider something that House Democrats or Senate Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know exactly what their thinking is on this. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell frequently does news conferences on Capitol Hill, so it might be a good question to ask him. \xc2\xa0I will say that the President is also mindful of the fact that Democrats in the House and Democrats in the Senate will need to support this legislation for it to pass.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in the same way that it would be foolish for Leader Reid and Speaker Boehner to try to circumvent Democrats in Congress, the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support that effort either. \xc2\xa0It seems unlikely that the President would support the kind of budget agreement that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t also get strong support from Democrats on Capitol Hill, so maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just a hypothetical exercise. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, the President understands quite directly that a budget deal will not be possible without the support of Democrats in Congress, which is why it would be foolish to leave Democrats in Congress out of those negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry, last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind talking about this at all. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, on that issue, if Republicans think that the most effective way for them to negotiate is directly with the President, the President certainly has done that in the past. \xc2\xa0Why not just have direct one-on-one negotiations between Leader McConnell and President Obama, come up with a plan that you guys think can sell, and go present it? \xc2\xa0The President could protect the interests of Democrats, as you just said, and carry sway in both those Houses, and the Republicans would be responsible for taking care of their part. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There are a variety of reasons for that. \xc2\xa0The first one is that there is a basic constitutional responsibility that Congress has, which is to pass a budget. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what members of Congress were elected to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s their basic responsibility, and the American people are counting on them to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is, the last time we were faced with this dilemma, the last time that Congress was challenged to pass bipartisan legislation to keep the government functioning at a level that appropriately invested in our economic and national security priorities -- that was an agreement that was reached in bipartisan discussions that took place on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Patti Murray and House Republican Paul Ryan sat down across the negotiating table and hammered out a good agreement. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not an agreement that anybody thought was perfect, but it was an agreement that represented a genuine compromise. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a compromise that succeeded in passing essentially a two-year budget agreement, which is why it\xe2\x80\x99s been two years since we last had this standoff. \xc2\xa0But the unfortunate thing about last time is that the country had to go through a 17-day shutdown before Republicans would agree to those kinds of conversations. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Republicans will agree to those kinds of conversations before a government shutdown this time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I guess the shorter answer to your question, Justin, is that we know that that is a strategy that works and we know that that is a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially consistent with the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back to Syria. \xc2\xa0What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy regarding Syria right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, first and foremost, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority when it comes to Syria is making sure that the national security interests of the United States are protected. \xc2\xa0And that has involved the use of military force by the United States against extremists that are operating inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recent announcements from the Pentagon about Hajji Mutazz, who\xe2\x80\x99s an ISIL -- leading ISIL operational figure who was killed in a U.S. military airstrike inside of *Syria Mosul last month. \xc2\xa0The Department of Defense reported earlier this month that a U.S. airstrike in Syria over the summer led to the death of David Drugeon. \xc2\xa0He was an extremist not affiliated with ISIL, but an extremist who was actively engaged in leading efforts to strike the United States and the West. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about the U.S. military operation that the President ordered inside of Syria against Abu Sayyaf that resulted in the death of that leading ISIL official and the exploitation of some intelligence material that was located there. \xc2\xa0There are a list of other extremists and other ISIL leaders that we can go through, but that is the top priority. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second priority has been the effort that\xe2\x80\x99s been made by the United States and our coalition partners to back the efforts of opposition fighters that are on the ground inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0So these are fighters like Syrian Kurds, Syrian Arabs, even some Turkomen fighters inside of Syria that have had some success in pushing back ISIL. \xc2\xa0So the President, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, earlier this year made a decision to resupply Kurdish fighters in Kobani who were under siege from ISIL fighters. \xc2\xa0Because they were resupplied, those Kurdish fighters did mount an offensive against ISIL fighters, and drove them out of Kobani and actually drove them out of a large swatch of northern and northeastern Syria. \xc2\xa0So there have been elements of that strategy that have been successful against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately, despite that important military activity that is critical to protecting the basic fundamental national security interests of the United States, the President is keenly aware of the fact that there is no military solution that can be imposed by Russia or anybody else on Syria, and that the root of this problem can only be solved with the kind of political transition that results in President Assad leaving power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99ve listed some priorities and you\xe2\x80\x99ve listed some operations that have taken place. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s try it again. \xc2\xa0Just give me, in short, what is our strategy in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, our strategy, first and foremost, is to protect the basic core national security interests of the United States, and that basically means preventing extremists like ISIL, but other groups who may be trying to capitalize on the chaos inside of Syria, to establish a safe haven that can be used to plot and carry out strikes against the United States or our allies. \xc2\xa0So that is the overriding priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President has also made clear is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to commit U.S. military personnel to a drawn-out offensive ground operation against ISIL or anybody else inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0So, that said, we are going to need ground fighters inside of Syria, and there have been a couple of ways that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to build that effort. \xc2\xa0One way has been this Department of Defense train-and-equip operation that as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty blunt about the fact that that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked out very well so far. \xc2\xa0The Department of Defense is considering some changes to that program that could improve the results.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat has been more successful -- significantly more successful than that -- is the support of the United States and our coalition partners for those Kurdish, Arab and Turkomen fighters inside of Syria that have had some success in driving ISIL out of some part of Syria. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been able to enlist the support of other U.S. allies, including Turkey, in an effort to try to close the border between Turkey and Syria. \xc2\xa0This is a border that stretches some 500 or 600 miles. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s now a very narrow corridor that ISIL is operating in to get access to the border that\xe2\x80\x99s only about 60 miles wide. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some more work to do, but we\xe2\x80\x99re enlisting our allies in that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, ultimately, the root solution here to this problem is a political transition that results in President Assad leaving power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But given the failure of our efforts to train and equip an opposition -- a moderate opposition in Syria, and given the significant change in the facts on the ground, now that you have the Russians conducting airstrikes and moving in a significant military personnel and equipment, is there an effort to rethink the entire approach -- a comprehensive review of our strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would not describe it that way. \xc2\xa0When it comes to opposition fighters, I\xe2\x80\x99ve routinely conceded, and I would do once again, that our training-and-equip operation has not performed well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a failure. \xc2\xa0I mean, you had four or five --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dramatic way to say it, which is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve described. \xc2\xa0But I think we can agree that it certainly has not performed well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the point that I want to make, though, Jon, is that those are not the only opposition fighters on which we can rely; that there are other reliable opposition fighters who we have backed both by providing them some assistance and also by carrying out military airstrikes in support of their operations on the ground. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is a fighting force on the ground, inside of Syria, with whom we are able to make progress against ISIL. \xc2\xa0But the reason that we have considered this training-and-equip operation is because we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see more of those fighters. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Department of Defense is considering changes to that program that would improve its performance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, one last quick -- totally different topic. \xc2\xa0We learned today the Vatican confirmed that the Pope met with Kim Davis while he was here in Washington. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to the meeting. \xc2\xa0The President did note in his comments over the weekend that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Americans across the country to say clearly that our religious freedom doesn\'t grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President talked about the importance of religious freedom when the Pope was at the White House on the South Lawn last week. \xc2\xa0But the President has been just as clear that our religious freedom doesn\'t grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their basic constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President would disagree with Pope Francis that Kim Davis acted \xe2\x80\x9ccourageously,\xe2\x80\x9d as her lawyer characterized his --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, secondhand. \xc2\xa0I think what I would say is our position about Ms. Davis is quite clear, that the President believes strongly in the rule of law. \xc2\xa0And that\'s a principle that applies to those who are engaged in public service, starting at the level of the President of the United States, but even going down all the way to the level of the Rowan County Clerk in Kentucky.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, following up on Congressman McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s comments on television about the Benghazi committee. \xc2\xa0His spokesman today is saying that Congressman McCarthy believes that the Benghazi committee has nothing to do with politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Oh? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That is an interesting spin, huh?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I was wondering what the White House reaction to Congressman McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s remarks might be, and whether there is a difference of opinion about whether the committee is interested in politics and specifically Secretary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think everybody here at the White House takes Mr. McCarthy at his word -- Congressman McCarthy at his word.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the thing that\'s happening here is that Leader McCarthy has committed the classic Washington gaffe of saying something that everybody already knows is true. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s quite apparent what happened on Fox News last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, can I follow up with a question on Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure, absolutely. \xc2\xa0Unless you want to talk more about Mr. McCarthy. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to do that, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You covered that I think pretty completely.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Syria, you said that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly surprising what has occurred with Russian-led airstrikes. \xc2\xa0Russia is saying today that Western airstrikes in Syria are illegal and that Russian strikes are legal because they were requested by President Assad. \xc2\xa0So my question to you is: \xc2\xa0As the White House is trying to wrestle with the idea of what constructive -- the definition of constructive offensive action might be by the Russians, how is the administration going to assess what Russia\xe2\x80\x99s intentions are; how the strikes are being called in; how they\'re being identified; what the results are; and what the implications might be for the Western coalition trajectory?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It comes to mind to me that I think there are three ways for us to do that. \xc2\xa0The first would be that one of the things that both President Putin and President Obama have asked their teams to do is to continue to consult. \xc2\xa0And so I would anticipate that Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov will have additional conversations about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activities inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been consulting regularly about this, and I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve met -- they\'re probably up to four or five times -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve probably met four or five times now just this week in New York to discuss these issues. \xc2\xa0So that ongoing consultation will be one channel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second would be that there will be these practical operational-level discussions between U.S. military officials and Russian military officials geared toward de-conflicting our activities inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Those conversations will give us a sense of what exactly Russia\xe2\x80\x99s operations are.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third is that we have a variety of ways, particularly given our presence in the region, to evaluate exactly what Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military operations are resulting in. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that our Department of Defense will continue to look at. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s one other aspect of our question that I also wanted to just remind you directly. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this in here before, but it had been a while so I thought I would remind all of you of the legal justification that we have cited for the actions of the United States and our coalition partners inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0So I do want to take this opportunity to get this back on the record again, which is that the United States provided public notification to the United Nations Security Council that the United States is using force against ISIL in Syria in the collective self-defense of Iraq and in U.S. national self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it was probably -- it may have been even a year since we talked about this, but the concern that we have long had -- and I think it was -- this was a concern that was justified -- is that ISIL would use the chaos inside of Syria to establish a safe haven, and then use that safe haven inside of Syria to expand their operations into Iraq. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what we saw that they did in the summer of 2014. \xc2\xa0And that is what has precipitated the kind of action that the United States military and our coalition partners have taken inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And that\'s entirely consistent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up, would the coalition -- the U.S.-led coalition -- if it differs dramatically with the Russians over choice of targeting, what the aims are, the strategy, is the U.N. then the body that the United States and Russia would disagree together -- would appeal to the U.N. based on what you just were reminding us?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the kinds of practical, operational discussions that would take place between U.S. military officials and Russian military officials would be geared toward preventing the circumstance that you just presented. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why both President Putin and President Obama have acknowledged that those kinds of de-confliction conversations are a priority, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why I would expect those conversations to take place in short order. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any indication that either side believes that that kind of conflict would be in the interest of either country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you just remind us, because of Jens Stoltenberg\xe2\x80\x99s comments about this in the last few days, is NATO involved in those de-conflicting discussions? \xc2\xa0Does NATO play a role?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but you might check with the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0My understanding, based on the conversation between President Putin and President Obama, is that those de-confliction talks would take place between U.S. military officials and Russian -- U.S. and Russian military officials bilaterally at an operational, tactical level.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0A senior administration official told CNN today that what Russia is doing seems to have no strategic purpose against ISIS. \xc2\xa0And it looks like they\'re hitting just groups that are opposed to Assad, and this is proof that their focus is not ISIS. \xc2\xa0Is that not consistent with what you\'re seeing? \xc2\xa0And if so, how is that going to affect what the coalition is trying to do there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\'s not something I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to say at this point because the Russian military activity inside of Syria is something that the Department of Defense is closely reviewing. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that that source was at the Defense Department and may have access to more information, at least more immediately than I do. \xc2\xa0These operations have only been taking place for a few hours now. \xc2\xa0So that analysis is underway at the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe priority that we have right now is trying to get those tactical-level conversations to de-conflict Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military activities with the U.S. and coalition military activities. \xc2\xa0Russia shares that priority, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- U.S. military officials have already been in touch with their counterparts to try to arrange those talks. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that those talks will take place in short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, but if that\'s a shared priority, if that were true, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that mean that they would have these conversations before they start airstrikes? \xc2\xa0And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that an indication that they\'re not as committed to that kind of communication being a priority?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think the way that we\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually be able to tell this is how serious Russia actually is in participating in these discussions. \xc2\xa0And based on the conversation between the two Presidents and based on the conversations that have already taken place between U.S. and Russian military officials to try to arrange those talks, and based on the pretty obvious observation that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how Russia would benefit from their activities coming into direct conflict with U.S. and coalition military activities, I think we can have some confidence that they\xe2\x80\x99ll engage in that process seriously. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the fact that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t started that process -- which was agreed to in this rare, high-level meeting -- doesn\'t this indicate that they\'re not that serious, that they didn\'t have that contact before they actually began?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there was contact between U.S. and Russian officials to set up those conversations, but those conversations haven\xe2\x80\x99t begun yet. \xc2\xa0But I would anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take place in short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, if we find that the Russians don\'t participate in those talks, or if Russia is less than cooperative in participating in those talks, then I think that we would have grounds to raise some questions about how serious they take this matter. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at this point I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to reach that assessment. \xc2\xa0Based on what President Putin has said both publicly and privately, I think -- and based on the obvious strategic calculation that I think is evident from the facts on the ground, it\xe2\x80\x99s in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest here for these de-confliction talks to occur.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, we know that U.S. -- based on the press release that went out, that U.S. airstrikes are continuing as planned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we know that obviously even without this communication going on, we know that there is no risk of these two operations getting in the way of each other. \xc2\xa0So we know that the Russians don\'t see the U.S. prioritize targets as their targets. \xc2\xa0And after the bilateral meeting, we heard Ben Rhodes say that it seems that the Russians are focused on ISIS. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut knowing what another administration official said just today, and knowing that what they\'re doing is in no way related or at risk with what the coalition is doing, does that change your view that they are focused on ISIS? \xc2\xa0Or does that raise serious questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s -- well, let me say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The other thing that the two Presidents agreed upon in their discussions at the U.N. on Monday was the risk that ISIL poses to U.S. interests, to Russian interests not just in the region, but around the world. \xc2\xa0Both countries share that priority. \xc2\xa0So the question, though, is what can we discern about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military strategy. \xc2\xa0And I think I would just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no military expert, but it does seem unwise to start drawing those kinds of firm conclusions based on military strikes that have just take place over the last few hours.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a variety of ways to get greater insight into their eventual strategy. \xc2\xa0That will include conversations between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov. \xc2\xa0That will include the operational level de-confliction talks. \xc2\xa0And it will include the Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s analysis about exactly what targets Russia has hit, and what the result of those strikes has been.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the fact that no one is saying they seem to be hitting anything to do with ISIS, does that not bother you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that our experts are taking a close look at this, and it\xe2\x80\x99s too early for me to share any conclusions with you at this point. \xc2\xa0The Department of Defense, if they have greater analysis, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll share it with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, putting aside the question of exactly what was targeted today, did the President, or has anyone on the U.S. side said to President Putin or others in the Russian government, we are arming -- \xe2\x80\x9cwe are backing some groups in Syria; do not target them\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0Have you issued that warning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that would be part of the kind of -- well, let me say a couple things. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for all of the conversations, and certainly would refer you to the State Department for a little more texture about the conversations between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Putin and the Russians are keenly aware of the strategy that I described to Jon earlier in this briefing, which is that the United States recognizes that boots on the ground will be required to stabilize the situation inside of Syria and ultimately to root out ISIL. \xc2\xa0The President has made clear that those will not be U.S. boots on the ground. \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some indications from the Russians that they\xe2\x80\x99re reluctant to put Russian boots on the ground. \xc2\xa0They are aware of the fact that the United States has made some progress against ISIL by relying on other opposition forces inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that bears mentioning is that President Putin, in the context of his meeting with President Obama, noted the importance of a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Now, he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to make the same commitment that we are -- or the same observation, frankly, that we have that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead. \xc2\xa0But implicit even in President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s description of the need for a political transition is the need for some kind of functioning opposition; that you can\xe2\x80\x99t really have a political transition in which the politics don\xe2\x80\x99t change. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think President Putin understands that at some level there\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be more of a political contribution from the opposition inside of Syria, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States has worked hard both to build up the capacity of -- the military capacity of the moderate Syrian opposition inside of Syria, but also worked to support the U.N.-led talks to facilitate conversations between the Assad regime -- representatives of the Assad regime and the moderate Syrian opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you not able to say with any certainty that there was a warning issued to the Russians -- \xe2\x80\x9cdo not touch this moderate opposition that we are supplying and backing and training\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to say is that there was not this kind of operational-level discussion between President Obama and President Putin. \xc2\xa0It was, as you would expect from two Commanders-in-Chief, it was a relatively high-level conversation. \xc2\xa0But certainly when it comes to de-conflicting our efforts, that would include making sure that Russia is not taking military strikes against U.S. military forces or other forces that are advancing the same goal that we are in coordination with our coalition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the U.S. would take a dim view of any attacks that targeted groups that U.S. equipment is being used by and that we\xe2\x80\x99re training and supplying -- whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re operating against ISIL, because some of them are also operating against the Syrian regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it is -- let me try to say it this way. \xc2\xa0We have sought a Russian contribution to our counter-ISIL campaign that\xe2\x80\x99s constructive. \xc2\xa0There are 65 nations that have worked with the United States to advance our strategy inside of Syria that includes backing opposition forces on the ground. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of ways that those forces can be helped. \xc2\xa0In some cases, that is providing some military air support. \xc2\xa0In other cases, that is providing them some military assistance. \xc2\xa0In some cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s even providing assistance like MREs and medical equipment that can be useful to fighters on the battlefield. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has provided I believe the last tally is about $400 million in that kind of assistance to Syrian opposition fighters. \xc2\xa0And we certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want Russian military operations to come into conflict with that ongoing effort, which is why both President Obama and President Putin have placed a priority on de-confliction talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tBob.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a quick follow-up to that. \xc2\xa0In his newfound zeal to fight Islamic State, did Putin suggest to the President that maybe the U.S. and its coalition partners should -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a better word, but stand down on the airstrikes in Syria? \xc2\xa0Kind of a let-us-handle-this attitude in the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The focus of their conversations with regard to our ongoing military operations and their planned military operations was the need for ensuring that those operations were properly de-conflicted. \xc2\xa0And both President Obama and President Putin placed a priority on those talks taking place at an operational level. \xc2\xa0And shortly after that meeting concluded, U.S. officials were in touch with their Russian counterparts to begin arranging that meeting. \xc2\xa0Those talks haven\xe2\x80\x99t occurred yet, but I would expect they would occur in short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was no suggestion, let us handle this? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, there was no specific request like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can you confirm that a Russian commander informed the U.S. military in Iraq that the strike was going to take place within an hour? \xc2\xa0And do you think this is appropriate considering that both Secretary Kerry and Mr. Lavrov are in the same city, most likely in the same building? \xc2\xa0And do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a slap in the face? \xc2\xa0And why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take it seriously?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, first, let me say I believe that the State Department has confirmed some version of that notification. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for the details.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second is, I don\'t know that -- I don\'t know exactly what time that took place, but based on the way that I learned about this, I suspect that took place overnight. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t think it would be accurate to say that both Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov were inside the same building at the same time. \xc2\xa0Presumably they were both asleep.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) the day before.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0But I take your point, and so that gets me to the point that I would want to make, which is simply that beginning these military-to-military conversations about de-conflicting our activities is important. \xc2\xa0And the kind of notification that you\'ve just described is obviously not the most efficient way for us to ensure that our military activities are de-conflicted. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why both Presidents have ordered military officials in their countries to coordinate at an operational level to more formally ensure that those operations are de-conflicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator McCain had a blistering attack on the administration this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Must be a day that ends in Y.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He said you\'re being weak, abdicating the leadership, et cetera. \xc2\xa0He said that you\'re inviting President Putin to the Middle East, first time to come back in full force since the \xe2\x80\x9870s, after Sadat kicked them out of Egypt. \xc2\xa0Does this alarm you? \xc2\xa0Does this cause you to look back at the strategy once again from your answer to Jon of revisiting what exactly that you wanted to do in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The short answer to your question is, no. \xc2\xa0The longer answer to your question is to observe that Russia has treated Syria as a client state for quite some time now. \xc2\xa0Five years ago, that client state was pretty stable. \xc2\xa0And right now it\xe2\x80\x99s a client state that is in utter chaos, where the leader that they have propped up for years is losing his grip on power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\'s a pretty clear indication that Russia is not flexing its muscles when it comes to Syria. \xc2\xa0Right now they are trying to prop up an investment that\'s about to go south. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that any sort of effort to double-down on their support for the Assad regime is a losing bet. \xc2\xa0And so I think that\'s -- and that\'s the first observation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing that I would say is that we would welcome a constructive Russian contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign. \xc2\xa0There are clearly priorities that we share. \xc2\xa0The leaders of both nations recognize the threat that is posed by ISIL. \xc2\xa0Both nations -- the leaders of both nations recognize that there is a fundamental political problem inside of Syria that has led to this chaos, that has taken the form not just of ISIL, but other extremists that are hoping to use the chaos in Syria to carry out attacks against countries around the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also has precipitated a terrible humanitarian crisis and a flood of refugees fleeing violence inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0That kind of refugee movement is not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest. \xc2\xa0And so there is plenty when it comes to our interests that Russia and the United States should be able to find such that Russia could be a constructive participant in our counter-ISIL campaign. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThus far that\'s not been the strategy that they have chosen to pursue. \xc2\xa0And if they\'re not going to be integrated into our broader counter-ISIL effort that includes 65 nations, then we want to make sure that any Russian military activities that are taking place inside of Syria, that are unilateral, are activities that are at least formally de-conflicting with our ongoing operations inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And President Putin agreed that that should be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Your opinion that this military strike would shift the dynamics to the degree that it might speed up or delay the political process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, after one day I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell. \xc2\xa0What we have said is that if Russia uses its military assets inside of Syria to prop up the Assad regime, that will make a political transition more difficult. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason for that is simply it\xe2\x80\x99s only going to ensure that the Assad regime alienates even more of the population and could essentially be run counter to the goals that both President Obama and President Putin say they share, which is the defeat of ISIL. \xc2\xa0By further alienating the population inside of Syria, you essentially serve as a recruitment tool for the extremists that are operating inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we believe that doubling down on Assad is a bad bet for the Russians, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why we have encouraged them to contribute constructively to our effort there.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two domestic questions. \xc2\xa0One, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall last February the President was pushing the Department of Labor to adopt a fiduciary duty rule, or you can call it conflict-of-interest rule. \xc2\xa0Today, a House committee is marking up a bill to delay that. \xc2\xa0Will the President veto such legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as you point out, they\'re still marking up some of this legislation. \xc2\xa0But it clearly -- so I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to issue a veto threat at this point. \xc2\xa0But what you\'ve described certainly runs counter to the priority that this administration and this President has placed on making sure that we\'re protecting the retirement savings of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome studies indicate that because this rule is not in place, that American families lose $17 billion in retirement savings every year -- $17 billion. \xc2\xa0That\'s a substantial risk that is not worth taking. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is -- and this is the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- the fact is that a responsible financial manager wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything differently. \xc2\xa0And rather, this is a rule that would ensure that there is no conflict of interest, and the retirement savings of middle-class families is effectively managed. \xc2\xa0And failing to implement this rule puts at risk $17 billion in retirement savings -- and that doesn\'t seem like a good idea. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why the President and his administration have moved forward with this particular rule. \xc2\xa0And we certainly would take a dim view of efforts by Republicans who are acting at the behest of Wall Street interests by the way to block it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just slightly different. \xc2\xa0Is the White House far more concerned now, with Speaker Boehner stepping down, about increasing the debt limit in the end of November, December?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be direct about it, this is an important responsibility of the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0And when you\'re talking about something this important, and you\'re dealing with a Congress that has been this unreliable, there\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be a source of concern. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s a concern that I would articulate to you whether the Speaker of the House is John Boehner or Kevin McCarthy or, frankly, anybody else.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\'re certainly mindful of and tracking closely. \xc2\xa0But ultimately this is the responsibility of Congress. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do the responsible thing that, to their credit, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done two or three times since 2011, which is ensure that the debt limit was raised without a bunch of drama that would unnecessarily inject additional volatility into the financial markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for the economy. \xc2\xa0It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And if Republicans in Congress focus on those priorities, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to worry about. \xc2\xa0So hopefully they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0So given that the confirmation was given by the Pentagon about what was essentially a knock on the door at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and that as we\xe2\x80\x99ve well established, both Presidents have agreed -- they looked at each other, in the eye presumably, and they agreed that it was a priority to de-conflict -- was an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice what President Obama had in mind when he spoke with Putin? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by saying this, Chris, which is that there was no persuasion that was needed on either side to make de-confliction a priority. \xc2\xa0Both Presidents readily acknowledge that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter of trying to persuade one side or the other that this should be a priority. \xc2\xa0Both Presidents readily agreed that because it\xe2\x80\x99s so clearly in the interest of both our countries to make sure that our operations don\'t come into conflict there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did President Obama take that agreement to mean one hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President took that agreement to mean that U.S. military officials would be in touch with Russian military officials to set up talks to engage in a formal process of de-conflicting those operations at a formal level. \xc2\xa0The outreach has occurred to begin setting up that meeting, but those actual talks have not yet taken place, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they will take place in short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does one hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice at least violate the spirit of that conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, the spirit of the conversation is the construction of a more formal process, where U.S. military officials and Russian military officials can engage in a regular dialogue to de-conflict their activities. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit of that agreement and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we expect to be set up in relatively short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So in the meantime, given that the Russians have launched airstrikes, does the U.S. just in the interim I guess trust that Russia is not going to conflict with U.S. military operations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the Russians have made clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in provoking a conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you trust them with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that they have said and that their actions thus far indicate that that\xe2\x80\x99s what they believe. \xc2\xa0But, ultimately, the more effective way and more efficient way for these activities to be properly de-conflicted is for these talks to take place between military officials at a tactical, operational level, and we anticipate that will take place soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want ask you a couple of questions on a couple of different subjects. \xc2\xa0Back on Russia, the relationship with the U.S. and Russia is complicated at the very best. \xc2\xa0And I want to find out -- you\xe2\x80\x99re taking the higher ground and talking about the situation that happened with Russia and Syria, but I want to go to reality. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the level of tension here at the White House with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions, especially as you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to de-conflict and preparing for talks, what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of tension around here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I was asked earlier about whether or not this Russian action would prompt a comprehensive reevaluation of the situation inside of Syria, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0The fact is, President Putin and the Russians have been trying to prop up Assad for a long time. \xc2\xa0And the fact that they are now having to ramp up that support is an indication that their previous efforts to prop him up weren\xe2\x80\x99t very successful. \xc2\xa0And the reason they were trying to prop him up is because this is essentially the client state that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the Middle East for quite some time now, and they\xe2\x80\x99re eager to try to preserve that toehold in the region. \xc2\xa0And so that principally is why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military activities to not come into conflict with our efforts there. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, if Russia is willing, we would welcome their constructive contribution to this effort. \xc2\xa0The fact that they have not decided to make a constructive contribution to our counter-ISIL effort means that Russia is not doing exactly what we would like them to do in Syria, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual in the relationship between our two countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve also pointed out on a couple of occasions here that there are areas of common interest that we have inside of Syria, and that relates to not just the priority that\xe2\x80\x99s placed on de-confliction, but also on the priority that\xe2\x80\x99s placed on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of our coalition, and that is a goal that President Putin, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident, would say that he shares. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere also was an acknowledgement on the part of the Russians that our view of the necessity of a political transition inside of Syria is correct -- that, at root, this is political problem, and that the problems that ISIL has caused will not be solved over the long term until a political solution is reached. \xc2\xa0What that means is it means that Russia is not going to be successful in imposing a military solution inside of Syria, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be no more successful in that regard than the United States was in imposing a military solution in Iraq in the last decade, and certainly no more successful than Russian efforts to impose a military solution on Afghanistan three decades ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to attack in another way. \xc2\xa0What was the level of surprise and upset after the meeting two days ago, and finding out what\xe2\x80\x99s happening today? \xc2\xa0What was the level of upset and surprise here in the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Quite low. \xc2\xa0Again, the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having conversations about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military commitment inside of Syria is because all of you were keenly aware of the fact that Russia had moved all kinds of military equipment, including fighter jets, into Syria. \xc2\xa0That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a secret; therefore, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to be taken by surprise. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent with the kind of efforts that they\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken in the last five years to prop up the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it certainly represents an escalation of those efforts, but the trajectory is the same. \xc2\xa0And obviously we would like to see Russia do something different. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to suggest to you that this is what we would like to see Russia do. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised that anybody would say that it had taken them by surprise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And another question on Kim Davis. \xc2\xa0How much time did this White House have to look at the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary prior to his arrival in the States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0How much time did the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you see his itinerary prior to his arrival in the States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that all of us had the opportunity -- all of you had his public schedule, and so were aware of his itinerary. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99re sort of getting at whether or not that we were aware that this meeting was taking place?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of the meeting, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know to what degree anybody else was either.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, were you taken by surprise by that? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Umm -- (laughter) -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0By anything? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know, right? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Mark, wait until you see what happens tomorrow. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bring an umbrella.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Exactly. \xc2\xa0I guess I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had sufficient time to consider, really, the consequences of this particular meeting. \xc2\xa0I did not know that it had occurred. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anybody else around here did, either. \xc2\xa0But the -- but you know, I guess I would, in terms of the reason for the meeting and what the objective was of the Pope in having the meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Vatican.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So did the President say anything to you, especially since he follows the media on his Blackberry? \xc2\xa0Did he say anything to you about this Kim Davis meeting and what she said -- the Pope said, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep doing what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing\xe2\x80\x9d to Kim Davis? \xc2\xa0Did he say anything to you about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a second-hand account.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s her account. \xc2\xa0She was there with the Pope. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s her account.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that her lawyer was there, though. \xc2\xa0And I think it was his comment. \xc2\xa0Well, but that makes it a second-hand account, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But she was the person giving the information.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0The point is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to the actual meeting. \xc2\xa0Our position on this issue has been quite clear from the very first day that this burst into the headlines, and that position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to touch base on Afghanistan before I double-back on Syria. \xc2\xa0You mentioned earlier that there had been a number of airstrikes to assist the Afghan forces as they attempt to reclaim the sixth-largest city in that country. \xc2\xa0Is the White House aware of 100 Special Forces on the ground, American personnel, as well, engaged in firefighting there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, for these kinds of operational questions, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0They can give you the most reliable information. \xc2\xa0My understanding, based on the information that I received before I came out here, is that there were three airstrikes that were carried out as a part of this effort. \xc2\xa0And they were carried out to protect U.S. and coalition forces that were providing advisory support to the ongoing Afghanistan effort to retake the city. \xc2\xa0So that is to say that clearly U.S. and coalition forces that are operating in that advisory role in Afghanistan are operating in a very dangerous place, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to -- or it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the military to carry out the President\xe2\x80\x99s mission, which includes force protection. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the military would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not accurate to describe them as being engaged in that firefight. \xc2\xa0The role that they have is to provide advisory support to the Afghans that are participating in that effort. \xc2\xa0And that, as I said once before and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just repeat again, that is not in any way to downplay the risk that these brave soldiers are taking on -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just an effort to try to describe to you precisely what their role is while they\xe2\x80\x99re there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I want to get sort of a big-picture view on Syria. \xc2\xa0There have been people over the last couple days in particular, Josh, that have suggested that Vladimir Putin is really running circles around the President; that strategically he is always one step ahead. \xc2\xa0In response to that, what would you say to people who feel like the President is being out-witted, out-strategized, even out-smarted by Vladimir Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the facts. \xc2\xa0The fact of the matter is, the Russians are responding from a position of weakness. \xc2\xa0They are seeing the client state that they have maintained inside of Syria progress over the course of five years from being a relatively stable state where they could exercise significant influence to a country that\xe2\x80\x99s torn apart by chaos and that risks the status of the leader that they have supported there for years. \xc2\xa0That is what has prompted Russia to ramp up their involvement there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is that Russia continues to suffer from the kind -- Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy continues to suffer from the kind of international isolation and economic costs that have been imposed on them as a result of their destabilizing activities inside of Ukraine. \xc2\xa0Russia, again, as a result of broader economic forces and the sanctions that the United States and our European partners have imposed on them, have led to a bunch of negative outcomes when it comes to their economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the IMF, the Russian economy will contract 3 to 4 percent this year, and it will remain in recession into next year. \xc2\xa0That stands in stark contrast to the vast majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s economies, including those that rely on energy exports that are slated -- that are projected to grow this year. \xc2\xa0Just in the last three years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Russian economy plummet in size from being one-eighth the size of the U.S. economy to being one-sixteenth the size of the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0And Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy now rates as the 15th largest in the world, coming in right after Spain.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all due respect to our friends in Spain, that is not a country that is thriving right now. \xc2\xa0This is a country right now that is sustaining significant economic costs and responding to a situation where they see their influence diminishing and the prospect of a significant long-term investment in Syria going down the tubes. \xc2\xa0So I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that I would make. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not inconsistent with the broader case that the President made in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly that one of the hallmarks of American influence and American strength is the fact that, at least in this situation, the United States is leading an international coalition of 65 nations that are carrying out an integrated strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0That certainly stands in stark contrast to the military operation that Russia is conducting today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it accurate then to say that the President is comfortable with the idea that Russia will take a larger, broader role in the region, even as the U.S. sort of steps back, in particular in Syria? \xc2\xa0Is that accurate? \xc2\xa0Is that inaccurate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think Russia would be wise to consider recent history before they take a wider role in the region that is focused on imposing a military solution inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Recent history makes pretty clear that they will not succeed in that regard, and they certainly will not succeed any more than the United States was able to impose a military solution in Iraq in the last decade. \xc2\xa0And they certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed any more than the Russian effort to impose a military solution on Afghanistan three decades ago. \xc2\xa0So I think this is the backdrop to the Russian military activity that we see inside of Syria today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, I want to ask you about the Secret Service. \xc2\xa0I know that often we end up with news reports when things go poorly for them, and yet having come off this dramatic week where they were very busy, I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, has the President personally gone out and thanked the women and men who not only protect him, but also protected a number of high-level visitors here in the last week or so?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, you make an appropriate observation, which is that the men and women of the Secret Service over the last week have faced the kind of significant challenges that no law enforcement agency -- let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0I think you could make a strong case that this has probably been the busiest week in the history of the Secret Service. \xc2\xa0And when you consider that they were responsible for protecting the Pope during his week-long visit to the United States over three different cities; when you consider that they have been responsible for the safety and security of the Chinese President while -- during his multi-day visit to the United States that included at least two cities that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of; and when you add onto that, that that took place while the United Nations General Assembly was going on, where there were more than 100 world leaders gathered in New York -- there were a wide range of significant responsibilities that the United States Secret Service had to live up to.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a matter of keeping all those individuals safe, it was also making sure that those individuals could travel efficiently around the country and around the cities that they were visiting, and at least when it came to the Pope, trying to balance the desire of the Pope to remain safe with his desire to engage with the American public. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is just -- all of this is a long way of saying, I admit, that the men and women of the Secret Service are dedicated professionals who are committed to serving their country and advancing the best interests of their country. \xc2\xa0And they have a very specific, unique mission for doing that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that over the course of the last week, when faced with these very significant challenges, that they were anything less than wildly successful.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On that point, did President Obama phone Joe Clancy to convey his commendation that he made publicly out on the South Lawn yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President -- yes, as you pointed out, the President did have an opportunity to talk a little bit about this publicly yesterday. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he had an opportunity to speak directly with Director Clancy. \xc2\xa0I know that Director Clancy himself has been pretty busy over the last week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99d probably take a call, though. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I bet he would. \xc2\xa0If something like that took place, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get you the information and let you know. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, of the 65 nations in the coalition, how many are willing to put boots on the ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Inside of Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me check on the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made. \xc2\xa0My guess is that most of them -- and I think I\xe2\x80\x99d even say the vast majority, if not all -- have, like the United States, been unwilling to make that kind of commitment, principally because they also recognize that a military solution cannot be imposed on Syria from the outside; that, rather, there is a premium on backing the efforts of opposition fighters on the ground. \xc2\xa0That ultimately those opposition forces that are members of the moderate opposition essentially represent what would hopefully turn into a moderate political opposition, and would sort of serve as the basis of the kind of political transition that needs to occur in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do the nations sign a document explaining what their commitment will be to the coalition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is something like this. \xc2\xa0The State Department -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that General Allen is a State Department employee -- he\xe2\x80\x99s retired from the military -- has been leading the effort to integrate the contributions of all of the nations who are part of this coalition. \xc2\xa0And so he\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in an effort to make sure that the expertise and resources of individual countries are best leveraged to advance the interests of the broader coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I believe that there is a way that they keep track of the kind of contributions that countries have made to this effort. \xc2\xa0But check with the State Department; they may be able to give you a better sense of how those records are kept.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one more thing. \xc2\xa0What is the subject of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today with the state legislators?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe those state legislators are actually in town for a more formal meeting, and the President invited them to the White House. \xc2\xa0And the President will speak to them a little later this afternoon about a range of priorities that he has. \xc2\xa0Some of those state legislators have advanced efforts to raise the minimum wage, or to implement Medicaid expansion. \xc2\xa0And it underscores the variety of areas where the federal government and state governments can work effectively together to maximize the benefits for their citizens. \xc2\xa0And the President will have more to say about this this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tJessica, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just a couple more on Russia. \xc2\xa0Does the White House or the U.S. acknowledge that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s timing is such that it comes just as the U.S. has acknowledged that the efforts in Syria were unsuccessful?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve long acknowledged the kinds of challenges that we face inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And I think Russia has long been involved in ramping up their efforts to support Assad. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s any turning point that you could point to in terms of our activities that would hooked to any new Russian decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the narrative that Russia felt the need to step in essentially where the U.S. was failing is not one that you would concur with?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that Russia felt the need to step in because Assad was failing, and Russia was concerned about the consequences that would have for their investment in that country. \xc2\xa0And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate that that\xe2\x80\x99s actually an accurate explanation of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President said earlier this week that he\xe2\x80\x99s open to working with Russia on the problem, obviously.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What are the chances of the U.S. accepting Russian help going forward, given what\xe2\x80\x99s just happened with these airstrikes and sort of seemingly being caught a little bit unawares?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, if a Russian offer is made that is constructive when it comes to cooperating with the broader international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, we would readily accept it. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s not an offer that Russia has made thus far. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Constructive, meaning they need to join your coalition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, meaning that it needs to be properly integrated with all of the other efforts that are underway there.</p>\n<p>\n\tTara, I saw you had your hand up, and you emailed me earlier saying you had a question, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me what your question is and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can answer it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell me about the raising of the Palestinian flag at the U.N.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0You want to -- we talked about this a little bit earlier. \xc2\xa0The United States, as you know, opposed the resolution to raise the Palestinian flag at the United Nations. \xc2\xa0But that is not and should not be construed as a change in any position on the part of the United States about Palestinian aspiration for statehood.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, the vote reflects the reality that the two parties themselves must ultimately take the responsible steps that are required to achieve a two-state solution, and to end the cycle of violence and suffering that\xe2\x80\x99s persisted for far too long in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, the United States continues to support the kind of two-state solution that would result in two states for two peoples with a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with a Jewish and democratic Israel. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody. \xc2\xa0See you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:11 P.M.
