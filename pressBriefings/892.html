Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:54 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here on a glorious afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAssociated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On Attorney General Holder, the Speaker has said that this matter will go to a contempt vote tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 There does not appear to be any signs of a last-minute effort to forestall that.\xc2\xa0 So it seems like we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved this beyond a hypothetical to this will happen tomorrow, there will be a vote.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the White House is deeply opposed to this for the reasons you said before, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could speak to what the -- what consequences for the country, for the White House, if any, you see if in fact he\xe2\x80\x99s held in contempt.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that House Republicans have made the strategic choice to try to score political points by focusing their time and attention on a law enforcement operation from 2009 that was botched and that everyone agrees was botched, and that employed a flawed tactic and everyone agrees that it employed a flawed tactic.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve made that choice, rather than focusing on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And with millions of Americans still struggling to pay their bills, I cannot imagine this will sit well with most Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou saw, I think, and it has been reported on, that Justice Department staffers, White House staffers met with committee members\' staff yesterday to try to resolve this, and there was an ample opportunity yesterday to resolve this, as there has been in the past when the Attorney General met with the Chairman.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the Republicans have chosen politics -- and I say that not just using my own voice, but I am quoting a leading House Republican who described this process as politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Justice Department has been extremely cooperative in providing thousands of pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General has appeared to testify numerous times on this matter.\xc2\xa0 And the chairman of the committee himself said on Sunday that he has, and there is, no evidence of any White House involvement in this operation and this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 We hope Republicans change their minds as to what the right course of action is, what\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing to do for the American people.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly understand -- or see and agree with the assertion by some, including a leading House Republican, that this is politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just spoke there at length about the motivations, as you see it.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to whether a contempt vote of the Attorney General by the House would have any substantive impact on how he does his job and the administration of justice in the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Department of Justice for answers to questions like that, although that is a hypothetical -- the vote has not happened.\xc2\xa0 What I can say, I think with some confidence, is that it will be viewed for what it is if it takes place, and that is as political theater, an action taken by Congress that does not respond to the most urgent priorities of the American people, and is the kind of political gamesmanship that frustrates the American people so much about what happens in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not why Americans across the country go to the ballot box every other November to elect members of the House.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t do it so that the House -- Congress in general -- engages in political gamesmanship and theater, and launches fishing expeditions.\xc2\xa0 They send them here to get work done that\xe2\x80\x99s essential for the health of the American economy, for our national security, creation of jobs -- and they send them for legitimate oversight.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities. And this administration has been enormously cooperative with Congress in its legitimate oversight function, and will continue to be so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, one other question, on Syria.\xc2\xa0 More violence today -- apparent attack at a TV station that the government there is blaming on the rebels.\xc2\xa0 Assad has said, yesterday I believe, that the country is in a state of real war.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House agrees with that assessment that Syria is in a state of war.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with what you mentioned at the top. We condemn all acts of violence, including those targeting pro-regime elements, and we call on all parties to cease acts of hostility -- this is in reference to your observation about the storming of a pro-Assad TV station.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s comments, his observation about the situation in Syria is all the more profound because he created it.\xc2\xa0 He caused it.\xc2\xa0 The violence that is occurring there, the brutality that\xe2\x80\x99s being leveled against the Syrian people is of his own doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we agree that the situation in Syria is serious.\xc2\xa0 It is dire.\xc2\xa0 It is resulting in the tragic and unnecessary deaths of civilians.\xc2\xa0 And it is happening because of Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to step from power in order to give Syria a chance for a better future.\xc2\xa0 It is the result of his choice instead to try to cling onto power at all costs, to try to cling onto power by spilling the blood of innocent Syrians.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we are working with our international partners to continue to pressure Assad.\xc2\xa0 We note the increasing number of defections that have taken place from the Assad regime and the Assad military.\xc2\xa0 And we remain committed to a transition in Syria that cannot -- because of the choices he made -- include Assad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.\xc2\xa0 Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the same topic, Kofi Annan has called a meeting on Saturday in Geneva, kind of a meeting to discuss conditions in Syria and his plan.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could tell us what the United States hopes to see happen there, and what\xe2\x80\x99s success look like in that meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we look forward to the June 30 meeting in Geneva that you mention, and we look forward to it as an opportunity to press forward with Syria\xe2\x80\x99s political transition.\xc2\xa0 We are working full-speed ahead on that transition at this critical juncture with our international partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSpecial envoy Annan has drafted a transition plan that we feel embodies the principles needed for any political transition in Syria leading to a peaceful, democratic and representative outcome that reflects the will of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 The sooner this transition happens, the greater the chance we have of averting a lengthy and bloody sectarian war, and the better we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to help Syrians manage a stable transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a step towards the transition that has to take place, but I would not speculate about or characterize on the outcome of a meeting that has not taken place yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On health care and the Supreme Court tomorrow, the President yesterday, the last two days, has vigorously defended some of the kind of consumer aspects that are already in effect on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the individual mandate and some of the government changes.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that popularity of those individual -- of those areas that he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about is enough to justify the constitutionality of the whole act?\xc2\xa0 And what should we expect tomorrow in terms of presidential reaction?\xc2\xa0 Will the President make a statement after the Court rules?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act depends not on public opinion of polls, but on legal precedent, which is well established.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken to this.\xc2\xa0 Many, many legal scholars have spoken to it.\xc2\xa0 Several very prominent conservative jurists have ruled in favor of the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act because of their view of that precedent.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the Affordable Care Act gives hardworking middle-class families the security they deserve.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that the law is constitutional, and I think that\'s what the President has been referring to, and that\'s why we\'re focused on implementing the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe await the Supreme Court decision, as does everyone, but while we do, we continue to implement the law.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 3.1 million more young adults who otherwise would have been uninsured have health insurance on their parent\'s plan, 5.3 million seniors with Medicare have saved $3.7 billion on their prescription drugs, and everyone on Medicare can get preventive services like mammograms for free -- again, because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And 54 million Americans with private insurance can now receive many preventive services without paying copayments or deductibles.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince you mentioned it, the mandate, the individual mandate was a product of a conservative think tank.\xc2\xa0 It was adopted by many leaders in the Republican Party in the \'90s.\xc2\xa0 It was adopted by and implemented by a Republican governor in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 And while the President opposed it in the campaign he, in the process of crafting a health care reform bill in office, was persuaded by experts in the field that it was the best and most efficient way to ensure that we can bring the largest number of people into and under coverage -- getting insurance coverage, and to allow for the -- to ensure that those with preexisting conditions get health care coverage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that was the impulse behind it.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s not about public opinion of polls; it\'s about policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned his original opposition to the idea of requiring mandates.\xc2\xa0 Is the health policy team here at the White House prepared to work on a congressional fix quickly, this year, depending on what happens with the vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\'t -- with just 20 hours left, or so, before we hear from the Supreme Court, or before we expect to hear from the Supreme Court -- speculate about hypothetical scenarios.\xc2\xa0 We await the decision, as everyone does.\xc2\xa0 And I can simply point you to what the HHS Secretary, Secretary Sebelius has said, that we are ready -- we will be ready for the decision when it comes down.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling updates for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would the President veto a bill that would delay the sequester until March of next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that the President has put forward, on numerous occasions, most recently in his budget, the kind of balanced plan that deals with our medium and long-term fiscal challenges while ensuring that we invest in areas like innovation, education, research and development, that reflects the consensus thinking of a broad array of experts and a broad array of Republicans and Democrats\xc2\xa0 -- at least Republicans who aren\xe2\x80\x99t currently members of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is the right way to go.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way to deal with our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way to ensure that in dealing with our fiscal challenges, we do not ask, as the Republican plan does, that the burden of meeting those challenges falls solely on middle-class Americans, seniors, the parents of children with disabilities, and others.\xc2\xa0 It asks that everyone does their fair share and that everyone plays by the same set of rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s the President\'s position and has been for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And that avenue remains open to Congress to take.\xc2\xa0 And again, it bears repeating that there is broad consensus on what the outlines of a comprehensive budget deal should look like.\xc2\xa0 It must include spending cuts; it must include changes to our entitlement programs to make them stronger; it includes -- and it must include revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have all three legs of the stool, then it is likely to fall over because it relies too heavily on one or the other and, in the case of the Republican plan, it basically doubles down on the policies of the first decade of this century and the previous administration that said the solution to our economic problems is simply to give more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and tell Wall Street and insurance companies and everyone else that they can write their own rules and that everyone eventually will benefit.\xc2\xa0 And the problem with that theory is that every tried it and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it precipitated the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President\'s approach is clear.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s not a lone voice out there saying that that\'s the approach we need to take. The outliers here are members of the Republican Party in Congress who have refused almost unanimously to acknowledge that we need to include revenues as part of a broader package.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The National Rifle Association is urging members of Congress to vote to hold the Attorney General in contempt because they say Fast and Furious is part of the Obama administration\'s anti-gun agenda.\xc2\xa0 Do you have response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about the outcome of a vote that we still hope doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen because it should not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s politics.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, in many ways, your question reflects the politics of this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would only say broadly that the idea behind that thinking suggests that there was some grand plan behind the Fast and Furious program when, in fact, everyone knows the President did not know about this tactic until he heard about it through the media; the Attorney General did not know about it.\xc2\xa0 The tactic itself was employed by the previous administration in a different operation.\xc2\xa0 This was a field office tactic that was flawed.\xc2\xa0 And when the Attorney General learned about it, he took action to ensure that it was no longer used, and he directed the Inspector General at the Department of Justice to investigate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the premise behind the assertion falls apart upon even the barest of inquiry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that this is part of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 agenda to score some political points, this contempt vote against the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi that this contempt vote is an effort to distract the Attorney General and the Justice Department on voting rights issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t really speculate about motivations except to point you to the words of observers as well as the leading House Republican that this is about politics.\xc2\xa0 What underlies the politics --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the politics?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you should ask those who are engaging in those politics.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that this administration has been very cooperative with the legitimate oversight interest of Congress, broadly speaking, and in regard to this matter.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice provided an enormous number of documents; provided hours and hours of testimony by the Attorney General and other Justice Department officials; and twice now has made an effort to accommodate the interest of the chairman and leaders in the Republican party on this matter.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, they have shown very little interest in reaching a resolution.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen a path of political confrontation and theatre -- which, I think, those of us who have been around for a while here recognize this for what it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Politics.\xc2\xa0 It has -- as I said before --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is the first time an attorney general is going to be held in contempt --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of Congress over this.\xc2\xa0 And the most you\xe2\x80\x99ll say is to score political points?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how preposterous it is.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not about Fast and Furious.\xc2\xa0 The operation itself, all the documentation relating to the operation itself prior to February 4th of last year has been provided.\xc2\xa0 The administration has endeavored to accommodate the committee and Republican leaders in its request for further information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe assertion of privilege here has to do with the absolutely necessary action that any President, any head of the executive branch must take in order to preserve the capacity of the executive branch to engage in internal deliberations, both now and in the future, for every administration going forward, for every President of either party, of some party in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned at all about the precedent this is going to set having his Attorney General held in contempt?\xc2\xa0 Has he called the Speaker of the House and asked him to reconsider?\xc2\xa0 Has he been personally engaged at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the Speaker of the House has made his position pretty clear on this, and it\xe2\x80\x99s highly political in nature.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the conversation about this with the President in the way that you framed it.\xc2\xa0 I think he --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he standing up for his Attorney General?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has absolute confidence in his Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 And what you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from me are the views of the President and the White House, the administration, that this is political theatre.\xc2\xa0 It is an unnecessary distraction from the work that Congress should be doing for the American people on the economy, on jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I think many Americans -- most Americans will view it that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, sorry, one final question on health care.\xc2\xa0 What if the Supreme Court strikes down the individual mandate but allows protections for preexisting -- or allows the protection for those who have preexisting conditions?\xc2\xa0 What then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, I cannot speculate on all the various permutations that have been put forward by really smart people in the press and in the health care field and the legal field.\xc2\xa0 I think we just have to wait for the decision and move forward after that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fast and Furious -- is the contempt vote worth a stand on principle?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, last week you said that the reason that all of these documents in question were not being turned over was on principle, not because there was any sensitive material that was being released.\xc2\xa0 So the fact is that now you most likely will have this contempt vote.\xc2\xa0 Was it worth it?\xc2\xa0 Was the stand on principle --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, was it worth it is taking a position beyond -- into the future that will have to be evaluated in the future.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely worth the assertion of a privilege that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for any President of any party to preside over the executive branch and allow for the executive branch to have the kind of internal deliberations that it needs to have as it responds to congressional inquiries or media inquiries.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cooperation that has been extended to Congress on this matter is extensive.\xc2\xa0 Everything about the operation itself -- who planned it, how the tactic was employed and why -- all of that has been provided in full to the committee.\xc2\xa0 And again, I would point you to the statements of the chairman of the committee who said over the weekend that there is no evidence -- he has -- after all this, he has what we made clear at the beginning, no evidence -- because there is there no evidence -- of White House involvement in this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was a field tactic that was a bad idea, and everyone recognizes that it was a flawed tactic, beginning with the Attorney General and the President.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General, when he learned about it, put an end to it -- its employment, its use -- and instructed the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to investigate it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, we have endeavored to cooperate with the legitimate oversight interests of Congress and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- as a leading House Republican has described it, it is politics.\xc2\xa0 And it is not what the Congress should be up to right now.\xc2\xa0 We know that we have challenges still.\xc2\xa0 We have economic challenges that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to finish work on the transportation bill.\xc2\xa0 It needs to take action to make sure that student loans -- student loan rates don\xe2\x80\x99t double in a few days.\xc2\xa0 It needs to -- it has the capacity to act very quickly on measures the President has put forward that would put teachers back in the classroom or even more construction workers on the job; would give homeowners across the country the ability to refinance their home at these historically low rates.\xc2\xa0 These are things that the American people care about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actions taken for political reasons by members of the House that win them spots on cable talk shows do not particularly interest, I think, the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think the highly political nature of this has been in evidence just by the actions and rhetoric that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Congress -- from Republicans in Congress on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there anything that the White House is doing now in these final hours to try to head off this vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you saw, it was reported, that several senior White House staff members as well as staff from the Department of Justice met with committee staff to try to resolve this.\xc2\xa0 There was an opportunity to resolve this, and I think it was rejected for political reasons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there anything else that\xe2\x80\x99s being done that can be done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There remains hope that Republicans will change their mind, will reverse their decision -- their strategic decision to try to score political points.\xc2\xa0 You remain hopeful that common sense prevails here, although you do have to look at the beginning of the year when Republicans announced that one of their chief legislative and strategic priorities was to investigate the administration and damage the President politically.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is not the kind of use of congressional time and authority that most Americans would support or endorse. They\xe2\x80\x99d rather have their leaders in Washington focus on the issues that matter most to them -- like economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick thing on the health care.\xc2\xa0 I know you said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule tomorrow, but what else will be taking place tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Is there a war room that\xe2\x80\x99s set up to respond -- rapid response to whatever the decision will be tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Anything that you can shed in terms of the behind the scenes that will be taking place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Most of our communications meetings happen in my office so you can call it a war room if you -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was thinking of something a little more -- something more sort of set up just for this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have meetings about policy and communications all the time, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re just, like you, waiting for an opinion, a decision, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll assess.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- gaming it, \xe2\x80\x9cif this happens this is what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are so many permutations I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how useful it is to spend at least our time doing that.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the HHS for questions about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking and the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re ready for a decision when it comes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House leaders are -- two questions, the first on health care.\xc2\xa0 House leaders have said in the press caucus that they are ready to -- if the Supreme Court rules it unconstitutional -- they would push for a single-payer method.\xc2\xa0 And do you think the President would favor a single-payer method?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President favors the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 It was the right thing to do to provide insurance coverage to 30 million Americans, to ensure that people with preexisting conditions could not be denied insurance coverage, children with preexisting conditions could not be denied health insurance.\xc2\xa0 It was the right thing to do so that young Americans could remain on their parent\xe2\x80\x99s health insurance policies rather than go without insurance.\xc2\xa0 It was the right thing to do so that important preventive services like mammograms could be provided to millions of Americans free.\xc2\xa0 And it was the right thing to do to ensure that seniors who faced significant costs through the prescription drug program were helped in alleviating that cost.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo these were policy prescriptions and the President, as you are, is awaiting the decision, and we will assess it when it comes and move forward accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does not concern him that members of his own party are already waiting for the Supreme Court to rule it unconstitutional?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve already come out with this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have heard every opinion imaginable expressed about what the decision will be, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me that some hold different opinions.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Fast and Furious, I was struck by what you told Norah that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on something that may not happen and you seemed to kind of indicate that to Dan as well, that you\xe2\x80\x99re still hopeful, in your words, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll find the right --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congenital optimist.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congenital optimist.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to selectively listen to that, but -- (laughter) -- heard in that a hope that something could be worked out.\xc2\xa0 But in answer to Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say whether or not -- okay, there were meetings yesterday, but are there meetings going on today or phone calls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the meeting that was held yesterday has been reported on was not because we let you know in advance it was happening.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to -- that reflected our good-faith effort to try to accommodate the committee and leaders on this matter to avoid what is a wholly unnecessary vote that is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings -- new meetings to preview for you or read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, wouldn\'t it be better if you can today to avoid it, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the suggestion that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing everything we can is ridiculous given that the Attorney General asked for a meeting with the chairman, and got one, in an effort to resolve this; senior White House officials as well as Justice Department officials met with committee staffers yesterday in an effort to resolve this; and at the time -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, last Tuesday the Department of Justice made an offer of accommodation. At the time, Republicans rejected the offer because they claimed to be uncomfortable making a deal without seeing the documents that Justice Department officials suggested they could be shown.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn response, yesterday we in the administration, Justice and White House reached out and showed them a representative sample of the documents that they sought so they could see firsthand the types of communications in contention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis offer would result in the committee getting unprecedented access to documents, showing how the Department responded to the committee\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry and would dispel any notion of an intent to mislead Congress.\xc2\xa0 These documents are all after the fact and do not pertain to who designed, approved, or employed the tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious or Operation Wide Receiver, or any of the other operations from the Bush administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was a good-faith effort to try to reach an accommodation while still protecting the institutional prerogatives of the executive branch, often championed by these same Republicans criticizing us now.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Republicans have opted, as I said, for political theater rather than conducting legitimate, congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the effort has been made on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with an effort to try to be responsive and cooperative to legitimate oversight interests throughout this episode.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully -- one can hope that Republicans will at the last minute change their mind about deciding to try to score political points out of this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s always room for hope.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your point about after the fact documents, you just said a couple of times before as well as last Thursday that -- in a briefing that all of the documents, you said, every page related to the operation itself, not after the fact, has been turned over to Congress.\xc2\xa0 After you made that statement Thursday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley came out and said, no, that they\xe2\x80\x99re aware of a lot of other documents related to the operation itself that have not been turned over by the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re contradicting that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the assertion of privilege clearly begins with the period after February 4th, which is when the letter --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not talking about executive privilege.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying on the operation itself he\xe2\x80\x99s asked for other documents, and the Justice Department has not turned them over.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Justice Department for details on what the 7,600 pages of documents that have been turned over.\xc2\xa0 But it is simply a matter of chronological observational fact that documents created prior to that time that had to do with the actual operation -- who designed it, who approved it, how it was employed in both Operation Fast and Furious and in Operation Wide Receiver -- had been provided because they predated that period.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe assertion of privilege is only on documents post-February 4th, and those documents have to do with the internal deliberations within the administration over how to appropriately respond to congressional and media inquiries.\xc2\xa0 And those are deliberations that need to be privileged and protected because of the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And that is a principle that has been asserted by administrations going back 30 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject -- the Colorado wildfires have been getting more and more dangerous, and I have not heard you read out in the last couple of days a phone call between the President and the Colorado governor -- or what kind of updates is he getting?\xc2\xa0 It seems like the situation is getting pretty desperate.\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to officials there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President did speak with the Colorado governor a while ago.\xc2\xa0 The President is being updated regularly.\xc2\xa0 I will read out to you further communications that he has on this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough the National Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates resources from the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of the Interior, and other federal agencies, firefighters, incident management teams, air tankers, helicopters, fire engines and other resources are being provided to supplement state and local resources as teams continue to respond to what you appropriately described as very serious fires across the West.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore than 8,400 personnel, 578 fire engines, and 79 helicopters are operating on wildfires around the United States. More than half of federal wildfire-fighting resources are currently staged in Colorado.\xc2\xa0 Federal partners continue to work closely with first responders and firefighters from local, state, and tribal agencies to combat and monitor large wildfires throughout the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFEMA has organized -- or rather has authorized three management assistant grants -- fire management assistant grants, known as FMAGs, since June 9, to help cover the state and local costs for fighting the fires.\xc2\xa0 I think you know the formula -- it\'s 75 percent of the costs assessed after the fires is picked up by FEMA.</p>\n<p>\n\tFEMA had deployed an incident management assistance team, known as an IMAT, to the Colorado Emergency Operations Center to work side by side with the Colorado Division of Emergency Management to monitor and support the firefighting efforts and has representatives in the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, which is coordinating the federal response to the wildfires in Colorado and Wyoming.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn answer to your question -- well, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s just that the phone call was on June 12th.\xc2\xa0 That\'s 15 days ago.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s been getting worse and worse.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered why the President hasn\'t had another phone call with the governor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been updated regularly on these wildfires.\xc2\xa0 And when I have further communications of the President to read out to you, I will provide them.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 If the action group that is set to meet this weekend on Syria is successful at re-implementing the peace plan and coming up with guidelines for a Syrian-led political transition, why should Syrians or the administration have confidence that it\'s actually going to work, given that Annan\'s former peace plan didn\'t?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think anything that depends on Bashar al-Assad\'s agreement and a promise to fulfill actions has to be viewed with skepticism, so I take your point.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that the transition plans that Kofi Annan has drafted embodies the principles needed for any political transition in Syria to lead to a peaceful, democratic and representative outcome that reflects the will of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the international community coalescing around a transition plan is an important step in the process of further pressuring, further isolating and hopefully, helping to bring about a transition that we believe needs to -- or cannot take place without Assad stepping aside from power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated today, Russia and China could play, or will play, a key role in this.\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication that they\'re shifting their positions, that they may be getting on the same page?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any updates for you.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly won\'t speak for those countries.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we have -- as I have in the past -- been in regular consultations with the Russians, as well as the Chinese -- in particular the Russians on this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt has been discussed by you and by us the fact that we have had differences with Russia on Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to work with the Russians to help bring about a goal that we both share, which is an end to violence in Syria and a transition in Syria, a transition that we believe cannot take place without -- cannot take place with Assad in power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we continue to work with the Russians and our other international partners -- and others have discussions with the Russians and others on this matter.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates for you on where those conversations stand.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then I guess what I\'m saying, has anything changed to make this more than just talking about a plan or implementing a plan?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think every step towards building a consensus around a transition that is essential for the Syrian people is a step forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to overstate that.\xc2\xa0 The fact is Assad is still in power.\xc2\xa0 The fact is Assad continues to brutalize his own people and the situation is extremely volatile. And as we have said in the past, there is not a great deal of time here for the international community to come together and act before the situation there potentially dissolves into a broader sectarian civil war, with implications for the region.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our partners urgently to try to avoid that outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I have one more on health care, Jay?\xc2\xa0 According to our latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, 37 percent of Americans said they would be pleased if the health care law were found unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 Why, on the eve of the Supreme Court announcing its ruling on this, has the administration failed to convince the American people this is a good thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, that\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve discussed this on a number of occasions over the months and years.\xc2\xa0 There was excellent reporting recently, I think, on the sheer volume -- in the millions and millions and millions of dollars -- that was spent in an effort to discredit the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The differential there in money spent was, I think, eye opening.\xc2\xa0 But it reflects the challenge that we have faced.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, the President\'s focus here has been from the beginning on crafting a policy that builds on our existing private insurance system that is most effective and efficient in expanding coverage that ensures that those with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage or thrown off their health insurance plans, and provides all the other benefits that I\'ve mentioned.\xc2\xa0 That was his aim.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think we\'ve been focused on implementing the law, and as that implementation continues, it has increased the number of Americans who directly benefit from the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If part or all of the law is upheld, do you need to shift your strategy to get the message --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'m very safe -- on safe ground here when I say that I will not speculate on a decision that is relatively imminent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Will the Attorney General be at the congressional picnic tonight?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have -- I haven\'t seen the RSVP list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ll get back to us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get back to you, sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, you might be able to answer this.\xc2\xa0 Do you know where the President will be when he finds out about the Supreme Court decision tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I know, generally, he has to find out, like everybody else does, through WSJ.com or some good website.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will be in the war room, in my office.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So here\'s my question.\xc2\xa0 A lot of Americans seem surprised or even skeptical that the President of the United States would learn about something this important the same way that everybody else does, and they are curious about the process. Can you comment on the mechanics of how the President of the United States or his representatives learn just like everybody else of the Supreme Court\'s rulings?\xc2\xa0 Because people don\'t believe it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we turn on televisions and radios and computers, and watch SCOTUS blog.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And it is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it\'s a leaky town and people are just so skeptical.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think anybody who covers the Supreme Court knows that it\'s pretty airtight.\xc2\xa0 And it is perhaps anachronistic, or not, but that\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And so, we all will await the decision and learn of it at the same time that you do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to one more thing you mentioned earlier, on the mandate.\xc2\xa0 You said that it was the product of a conservative think tank, and the President was persuaded to include it, in part because his aims -- he thought covering 30 million Americans was the right thing to do, and including preventative care was the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 At this point, in hindsight, does he think the mandate was the right thing to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He continues to believe that that was the most efficient and effective way to build on our private insurance system, to provide coverage to the most people in the most efficient way, and provide the benefits that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not just making this claim about it origins.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been well documented.\xc2\xa0 For those of us who were reporters in the 1990s, during the health care debates then, we keenly remember the fact that there was a bill put forward by a Republican member of the Senate, endorsed by the Republican leader of the Senate and numerous other Republicans in the Senate that contained within it this individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact.\xc2\xa0 And it is something that has enjoyed the support of Republicans and Democrats for a number of years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was a great piece in the New Yorker the other day about that remarkable transformation and decisions made about group affiliation trumping policy.\xc2\xa0 And I think that may be what we have here, is a case of a concerted decision to abandon what was considered very mainstream conservative thinking on an issue like health care policy once it had been adopted by the other party.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The transportation bill seems to be coming together up on the Hill right now.\xc2\xa0 What is your guys\xe2\x80\x99 assessment of that as you know it now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, congressional negotiators are still working on it, and we look forward to seeing the final product.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely essential that Congress act so that thousands of construction projects around the country do not come to a halt and that we keep those many, many, many construction workers on the job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the kind of work that Congress should have been and should be focusing on, rather than some of the purely political issues that we were discussing earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are cautiously optimistic that this will come together, but again, we await the outcome of negotiations in Congress.\xc2\xa0 It is our understanding -- as I think it is yours -- that the package would include action on ensuring that student loans rates do not double.\xc2\xa0 That would be a welcome thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you okay with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it is important to note that the only reason why that is in this bill, the only reason why it will get acted on, hopefully in time, before the rates double, is because the President made a federal case out of it.\xc2\xa0 The President pointed out that Republicans were prepared to allow interest rates to double on 7.4 million students.\xc2\xa0 The only reason why any of us have had this discussion for these past several weeks is because the President insisted that Congress take action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in sort of a pattern that we have come to see where these sort of stages of denial and then acknowledgement and then acceptance -- it was a phony issue; it was a distraction from the economy, when, in fact, education is very much a part of the economy, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view and most people\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 Then there was an attempt to try to get a political scalp in the so-called pay-fors that was not a serious attempt to deal with this matter.\xc2\xa0 And gradually, we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to a point where hopefully we will reach an agreement that everyone finds acceptable and that, most importantly, allows 7.4 million students in this country to continue to pay their students loans at the current rate as opposed to double the rate.\xc2\xa0 And that is purely a result of the leadership the President has shown on this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any objections to the way things are so far that you know of now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we\xe2\x80\x99re awaiting a final product from congressional negotiators.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have any details on the bus trip next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 None beyond what\xe2\x80\x99s been provided.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything additional for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s another round of TPP talks in San Diego next week.\xc2\xa0 I know a lot of Democrats on the Hill have written a letter asking for more consultation, and now Congressman Issa is asking to be included in the talks as an observer.\xc2\xa0 How much congressional input does the administration see room for at this stage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Scott, I will have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I have not focused on it today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t focused on TPP?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know, you really -- (laughter) -- is that a slider or a change-up?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tViqueira.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of anachronisms, so the President regularly bashes Congress.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold his Attorney General in contempt.\xc2\xa0 Things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going so well.\xc2\xa0 Why bother with the congressional picnic?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great American tradition, and the President looks forward to it, as do I.\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- I think there are six different kinds of barbeque and -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99m told.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What else is there --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you an after-action report.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, for the first time since 1990, the United States will host next month, right here in D.C., the international AIDS conference.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told the President was invited to speak at this event but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet confirmed to make an appearance.\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak at the conference?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, but I do not have a scheduling update for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s FY13 budget request cut nearly half a billion dollars, or 13 percent, from the President\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.\xc2\xa0 Is the hesitation to accept the invitation over any concern that the President may not be well received in efforts to address the global AIDS epidemic?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting things, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 But thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:48 P.M.
