CDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give you one brief announcement up top and then I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>As the President has in recent days, (audio drop) -- the President has held discussions with eight of his counterparts in recent days, and those eight countries have pledged at least $300 million in financial contributions to date.</p>\n<p>(Inaudible) why this administration has been so focused on marshaling the global resources needed to tackle this virus at its source in West Africa (inaudible) from around the world the past few weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry -- today or to date?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 To date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At least how much?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 $300 million in financial contributions to date while also committing to significant contributions in personnel, aircraft and resources on the ground.\xc2\xa0 We believe this is American leadership at its finest, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to lead the charge to muster additional international support just as we contribute significant resources of our own.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify on that -- the briefing will be a telephone briefing -- because she\xe2\x80\x99s back in Washington -- with Monaco?\xc2\xa0 And then, did he talk to any leaders today or any other readouts?\xc2\xa0 Or we\xe2\x80\x99ve just had the ones that you\xe2\x80\x99ve already read out?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking to Lisa this afternoon via phone.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional foreign leader calls to read out to you that occurred on this trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you talk a little bit about Ron Klain -- when he starts and exactly what his role will be, who he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be facilitating with?\xc2\xa0 And exactly how you see him playing out at least in his is first week and going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, Katie.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Klain will start on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 He will be our -- coordinating the administration\xe2\x80\x99s whole-of-government Ebola response.\xc2\xa0 He will report directly to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to ensure that efforts to protect the American people by detecting, isolating and treating Ebola patients in this country are properly integrated but don\xe2\x80\x99t distract from the aggressive commitment to stopping Ebola at its source in West Africa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you able to say why the Wednesday start date?\xc2\xa0 He was -- the announcement was Friday, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that long of a period, but some people are wondering why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take part in some of the meetings that have already happened.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reasoning behind that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, it is not that long of a lapse.\xc2\xa0 And as a student of the federal government, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know that the onboarding process usually takes much longer -- weeks or months.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, in this case, we were able to expedite that process because Mr. Klain has already been a member of the administration, so we were able to sort of get that done very fast, and we look forward to his arrival in his official capacity on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>I can also tell you he\xe2\x80\x99s already been meeting with our Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, and some other folks to get read up so that he can start on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he part at all of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting on Saturday? \xc2\xa0Or has he talked to the President at all about -- other than the job offer that came on Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He was not in the meeting that you\xe2\x80\x99re mentioning on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 Again, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t officially start until Wednesday, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out sort of other private conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get paid?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He will be paid.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, that as part of our annual release reports, those will be on the website.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have his salary in front of me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we talk about Turkey, Eric?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to get confirmation on this that he is not going to testify before Chairman Issa\xe2\x80\x99s committee on Friday, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That is correct.\xc2\xa0 But the administration will have representatives there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be at?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be day three of his tenure.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about Turkey.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify one thing?\xc2\xa0 Did Turkey agree or consent to the U.S. airdrops of supplies to the Kurds?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as you know, we actually read out a conversation between President Obama and President Erdogan earlier this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the Turkish response, but I can tell you that the President made clear, as have other members of the administration, we are interested in doing this, and the urgency by which we see it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they did not talk about Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s response, but instead what the U.S. said.\xc2\xa0 Did the United States offer Turkey anything to get them to agree to allow this to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President made clear why we consider it urgent and essential to resupply the fighters in Kobani who are in a desperate situation in their struggle to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s assaults on the city.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also tell you that the United States and Turkey have a shared interest in defeating ISIL, seeing a political transition in Syria, and bringing stability to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also, lastly, draw your attention to statements from the Turkish Foreign Ministry today that Turkey intends to facilitate the crossing of Iraqi-Kurdish Peshmerga into Kobani.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work closely with Turkey and the Kurdish Regional Government Authorities on a suitable way forward to support opposition groups in Kobani and over the long term degrade and defeat ISIL.</p>\n<p>The President and Secretary Kerry have had productive conversations with Turkish leaders on this issue during the past several days and conveyed the urgency of supporting the opposition fighters in Kobani who are standing against ISIL, again, as recently as that Saturday night conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We now know that those -- the arms shipments that we dropped to them basically consisted of small arms.\xc2\xa0 What kind of a difference does the U.S. anticipate that basically rifles will do for the Kurds in fighting the well-armed Islamic State militia groups?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, the aircraft delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies that were provided by the Kurdish authorities in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it to the experts to describe this, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been very specific needs articulated by the Kurds in order to take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And I think that given the United States\xe2\x80\x99 unique capabilities, that\'s what -- the role we were able to play is transport those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re two weeks out basically from the election.\xc2\xa0 So far this trip, obviously two fairly blue states -- Democratic governor races, not the Senate races.\xc2\xa0 Is there any anticipation that in these final two weeks the President will get his voice back and will go to some tougher places where Democratic Senate candidates are facing -- maybe right on the edge, Iowa, Colorado, North Carolina, some of those places?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mike.\xc2\xa0 As I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, we put out a rundown of places the President is going to be campaigning over the next few weeks on behalf of Democratic -- there was one senator in Michigan, and so if I don\'t have any updates to you -- for you on that rundown at this point, I can say clearly the President articulated better than I could what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake both -- twice yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So as you point out, there\xe2\x80\x99s a variety of members of folks in cycle that he\xe2\x80\x99s appeared with and will be appearing with in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the big thing this afternoon at his house?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, he is doing a little bit of work from home.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be receiving the briefing from Lisa Monaco.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also going to be doing a couple of interviews with African American radio stations, like he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing in the past week or so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he glad to be home?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 I think Chicago is always a great place for him to recharge his batteries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, the interviews, the African American radio interviews are campaign-related, or otherwise?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll cover the waterfront I assume.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not the host.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'re not specifically targeted in places to turn out the vote or what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the stations?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will see what I can do to get those for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think any of them are airing today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you flesh out the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for the rest of the week at all for us?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have too much to add.\xc2\xa0 I do -- as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be headed back to Washington tonight, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Washington for most of the week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No additional travel at this point --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\'t have anything to add on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does President the President have a response to the news out of Nigeria that Ebola has been basically eliminated there, as well as the news in Dallas that the contacts of Mr. Duncan are free of Ebola, and in Spain where the nurse no longer has Ebola?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President is going to get briefed on this this afternoon, so I don\'t have a readout of that briefing.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the best way to protect the American public from Ebola is to stop the disease at its source in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 And there is no country better prepared to confront the challenge Ebola poses than the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we are leading the international coalition to stamp it out at its source, and we have been doing that since March when the first cases appeared, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve stepped up that effort since.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got a follow-up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the $300 million, are there any details yet on which countries have stepped up, which countries are not on that list yet?\xc2\xa0 Is the President pushing for more money out of other countries, as well?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President is always pushing for more.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is an issue that\'s going to require significant resources across the board, and that\'s why I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to see him push international partners for this.</p>\n<p>In terms of the details on what other countries have announced, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let those countries speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 I do know that some countries like Sweden and the U.K. have put out in detail what they\xe2\x80\x99ve contributed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over Friday and the weekend, there have been more and more people calling for an Ebola-based travel ban.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration still against that?\xc2\xa0 And also, there have been a number of reports showing just the climate of fear in the United States -- people keeping their kids away from school, and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 What does the President and the administration say to those types of stories of people who are keeping children out of school and canceling events because someone may have been in a place where Ebola may have been?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 On the travel ban, I think you all heard the President discuss this I believe on Thursday in the Oval Office -- last week, late last week in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, and that is that our focus is on reducing the risk to the American people, and a travel ban would not do that.</p>\n<p>Our top priority is the health and safety of the American people, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why, right now, travelers from those countries are subjected to screening prior to departure from West Africa and they\xe2\x80\x99re also subject to additional enhanced screening upon arrival in the United States.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to let the science and the doctors guide our policymaking here, and it seems that without question there is agreement that a travel ban would impose -- would make it harder for critically needed personnel and supplies to surge into West Africa where the problem exists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, I wanted to ask about suspected Nazi war criminals and SS guards receiving millions of dollars in Social Security payments from the government after being forced out of the U.S. as leverage to get them to leave.\xc2\xa0 Both the Justice Department and the Social Security Administration have refused the AP\xe2\x80\x99s request to provide a total number of who received the payments and how much they received.\xc2\xa0 And considering your administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to being the most transparent administration in history, I was wondering why the administration believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the public interest to keep information private about suspected Nazi war criminals.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I did see that story from your Associated Press colleague, and I would tell you that the Justice Department did say that they have aggressively pursued Nazi criminals and brought over 100 of them to justice.\xc2\xa0 The Social Security Administration and the Department of Justice also worked together within the confines of current law to cut off benefits for criminals that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be receiving them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with the federal agencies citing U.S. privacy laws to guard information about individuals who have been kicked out of the United States because of their Nazi past?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I said that.\xc2\xa0 What I do think we are -- our position is we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe these individuals should be getting these benefits.\xc2\xa0 As the Justice Department has said, they have worked aggressively to pursue Nazi criminals with the aim of ensuring they\xe2\x80\x99re brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 The Social Security Administration and the Department of Justice have to work together within the confines of the law to cut off these benefits for these criminals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, reports over the weekend that concern amongst some growing on the Hill about the possibility of the administration trying to unilaterally at least ease or roll back sanctions on Iran as a part of an upcoming nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration reaction to those who have concerns that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to go about it alone?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I saw that story, too, and it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 The administration believes that Congress has a very important role to play on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear issue -- on the Iran nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 As I think -- if you read it, our take was that the story conflated two separate issues:\xc2\xa0 When and how congressional action will be needed to suspend and/or lift the sanctions, and whether we believe they should take up and up-or-down vote on the deal.</p>\n<p>The notion that we are trying to avoid congressional input and consultation on this is preposterous.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue where we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to Congress intensively, will continue to consult with Congress heavily.</p>\n<p>And on sanctions, we have made absolutely clear publicly in testimony and in private discussions on the Hill that in the first instance we would look to suspend sanctions, and then only if after Iran has upheld its end of the arrangement would we look to terminate that sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But this is for a good reason -- suspension makes it easier to snap the sanctions back into place if the deal isn\xe2\x80\x99t upheld.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as a representative of that -- of the news organization with that story --\xc2\xa0 so you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that you want consultation and input from Congress, but what are you saying specifically about an up-or-down vote?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview anything from here while those negotiations are still ongoing.</p>\n<p>What we take issue is with the suggestion that we\xe2\x80\x99re not in heavy consultation with Congress on this, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not working very, very closely with them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking to go around them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to clarify, that suspension of sanctions that you discussed is something that the administration believes it has the authority to do without a vote from Congress, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Our position has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And whether we believe Congress should take an up-or-down vote on the entire arrangement, if we get one --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the position that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 First, the notion that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to go around Congress on this is preposterous.\xc2\xa0 Second, on the sanctions that we would look to suspend, if Iran has upheld its end of the arrangement, we would look to lift or terminate sanctions, and this is for a good reason.\xc2\xa0 Suspension makes it easier to snap sanctions back into place if the deal isn\xe2\x80\x99t upheld.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s way too early to speculate on which sanctions will require legislative versus executive actions to suspend or lift.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of that from here today while the negotiations are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prudent.\xc2\xa0 But suffice to say, if we do get a comprehensive arrangement, it is absolutely true that the sanctions regime we have in place cannot be undone without congressional action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As opposed to the -- you\xe2\x80\x99re drawing the distinction between the suspension and a permanent kind of revoking of it.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 What I said is, up top, how we thought the story unfortunately conflated two issues.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last question on Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration be seeking additional funds from Congress?\xc2\xa0 And if so, can you give us a sense of how much and when?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of interest from Congress in terms of dedicating resources to solving this problem and the urgency of it.\xc2\xa0 So if we were to send up a request, I assume that there would be widespread support.\xc2\xa0 So we welcome that, but at this point there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, there were reports this morning, since Josh\xe2\x80\x99s last briefing, that members of Congress have been in discussion with the White House about potential options for additional funding.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm at least that those discussions are underway?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of private meetings or conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0 It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me that we\xe2\x80\x99re always in touch with members of Congress, especially on an issue like that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics in terms of any specific meetings or consultations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a little weird or a little out of the ordinary that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing campaign events, or that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any campaign events on the schedule for this week, just two weeks before an election?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s weird given everything that we are trying to manage.\xc2\xa0 As I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said now for some time, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of significant, complex situations going on both around the world and here at home.\xc2\xa0 And I think a lot of those issues have dominated the President\xe2\x80\x99s time.</p>\n<p>Given that the elections are a few weeks away, obviously that is a priority as well.\xc2\xa0 So I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President, as you did yesterday, campaign when he can.\xc2\xa0 But obviously given that Lisa Monaco is briefing him this afternoon on a briefing on the Ebola response, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on managing those problems as well.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:40 P.M.
