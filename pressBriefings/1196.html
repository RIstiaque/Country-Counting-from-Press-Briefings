Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for an answer to a question (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t*The President stands firmly behind the nomination of Don Berwick because he\xe2\x80\x99s far and away the best person for the job, and he\xe2\x80\x99s already doing stellar work at CMS: saving taxpayer dollars by cracking down on fraud, and implementing delivery system reforms that will save billions in excess costs and save millions of lives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:48 P.M. EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Before I get started two quick things.\xc2\xa0 One, an acknowledgement, not an announcement\xc2\xa0 -- today is my sister\xe2\x80\x99s birthday and I wish her a happy birthday. She is my dear --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s her name?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Elizabeth Carney.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we have a filing break?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I spoke with her this morning, and we are very close.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second is that some of you have been asking and I can confirm that the President is having a meeting early this afternoon with Senate Democratic leaders here at the White House to discuss obvious matters.\xc2\xa0 I also can tell you that the Vice President, who is in Moscow, is making some calls -- leadership calls as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s all I have on the announcement front, so let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on Libya, please.\xc2\xa0 Can you set expectations for today\xe2\x80\x99s principals meeting? In particular, is this the day when the team is trying to settle on a recommendation for the best intervention strategy to present to the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, today is a principals committee meeting -- as you know, these happen with some regularity -- and they are discussing the events in Libya and in the region.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate -- in fact, I know this is not a decision meeting.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously one in which the events that are evolving in Libya will be reviewed and discussed and the variety of options that we have already taken and are implementing will be discussed, as well as the options that remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 But I think I would not -- I don\'t want to raise expectations that this is a meeting that will lead to an imminent, concrete decision about some action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of the questions that we have go to a sense of urgency on behalf of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And you talked to us about the perspective of how fast things are moving.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m curious, the story in Libya seems to be going the wrong way in terms of certainly the hopes of the White House.\xc2\xa0 Qaddafi seems even more and more entrenched as the day goes, instead of less.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if that pattern of events changes the timeline at all here, quickens the need for a decision about how to intervene.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, let me take you back a little bit, because I understand your question and I understand the sense of urgency that\'s created by what we\'ve been witnessing occur in Libya.\xc2\xa0 But let me remind you, first of all, what has been done in remarkable time.\xc2\xa0 We have imposed very strong sanctions, including freezing over $30 billion of the Qaddafi regime\xe2\x80\x99s assets.\xc2\xa0 We have coordinated also with the United Nations for additional sanctions with our European partners and through the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 We have led the way in initiating steps through the United Nations to make sure that those members of the Qaddafi regime who are responsible for gross violations of human rights and the use of violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 That includes a U.N. Security Council referral of the Qaddafi regime to the International Criminal Court.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are engaged in a highly swift and coordinated effort to provide humanitarian assistance and we have also, through a variety of channels, reached out to the opposition to discuss what their goals are and what their situation is.\xc2\xa0 We have also done military contingency planning.\xc2\xa0 We have talked about positioning resources in the region for contingencies that might occur of all sorts.\xc2\xa0 And let me remind you that the meetings in NATO this -- at NATO this week in Brussels were initiated by the United States of America, by this President.\xc2\xa0 This has all happened in three weeks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLet me take you back to April of 1992, which is when Yugoslav air force jets began to bomb civilians in -- essentially, when the violence began in Bosnia.\xc2\xa0 It took -- for an arms embargo which has already been initiated by the U.N. against Libya -- three months from the declaration of Slovene and Croatian independence for the imposition of an arms embargo.\xc2\xa0 It took nine days in this case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen the ethnic cleansing began in April of \xe2\x80\x9992 in Bosnia, it took a year, over a year, for an asset freeze; over two years for a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 Again, our actions were in under two weeks in this case.\xc2\xa0 There has never been a situation where the international community, with leadership by the United States, has acted as quickly as it has to respond to this kind of situation.\xc2\xa0 And this is not the end of it.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to review options, and we are obviously aware of the suffering in Libya and the violence there.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is very important for people to understand the kind of dramatic action that has been taken with the leadership of this President, and that will continue to be taken as we move forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that a decision is not necessarily going to come today, can you give us a sense of when something like that would come?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jeff, there have been meetings all week in Brussels, at NATO.\xc2\xa0 They continue.\xc2\xa0 We are in the process of reviewing a variety of options, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed from here, from Air Force One yesterday, and others obviously have discussed.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you for further decisions, or even, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put on the table here that some action will take place at some point in the future.\xc2\xa0 The actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken have been dramatic, and we are implementing them in a way that we hope they will have an effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are also, as you know, using the full spectrum of our intelligence resources to ensure that we are monitoring what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Libya and in a way that will enable the international community to hold responsible those members of the regime who are perpetrating violations of human rights.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 The review continues, the options are refined and reviewed and considered, and obviously, we want to work with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 We feel it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to -- so that any action we take be done in a coordinated way with our international partners, because that is a powerful message to the people of Libya, to the Libyan regime, and to the people around the region:\xc2\xa0 This is not about the United States; it is not about Western powers, European powers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the people of the region, and in this case the people of Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me switch topics really quickly.\xc2\xa0 Regarding Secretary Locke, when do you expect to name a successor for him? And do you expect that his appointment to be ambassador to China will go relatively rapidly through the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly anticipate that Secretary Locke will be approved by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He has been approved obviously once before for his current post, and he is a, we feel, supremely qualified candidate for the ambassadorship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The process that the President just went through was one to search for a replacement for the ambassador to China.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one -- that was the primary goal.\xc2\xa0 It was not to search for a replacement for whoever filled that role.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you on naming a nominee to succeed Secretary Locke.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First of all, happy birthday to your sister.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She thanks you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Republicans on the Hill have seized upon NPR\xe2\x80\x99s latest woes to talk about how it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the federal government to stop subsidizing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposes more than $400 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any response to the recent kerfuffle involving the resignations of both Schillers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, everyone agrees that we need to cut spending.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a budget that does that in dramatic fashion.\xc2\xa0 We also -- that budget also contains within it the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congress to find common ground, as you know, on the broader budget issues.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that -- or rather, we do not support calls to eliminate funding for National Public Radio and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as is evidenced by our budget. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we think they are worthwhile and important priorities, as our budget makes clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just elaborate a little bit?\xc2\xa0 Why are they important priorities?\xc2\xa0 What do they do that -- I mean, Republicans argue, okay, Republicans argue that the marketplace should support the programs of public radio and PBS.\xc2\xa0 Why does the administration disagree?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Mara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re forgiven.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just feel for -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Why does the administration disagree?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly offering a full-throated defense of that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, can you elaborate? Why is it --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- wait, wait.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by a full-throated defense.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it was pretty full-throated.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I am saying is that our budget makes clear -- you guys could -- Mara, would you want to come up here?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the budget makes clear the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities, and among them are the funding at the level that we stipulate in the budget for National Public Radio and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think people here want to get into the history of public broadcasting and public radio and why successive administrations of both parties have felt that it\xe2\x80\x99s worthwhile.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that we do. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on the budget as well.\xc2\xa0 You have the President meeting with Senate Democratic leaders, you said.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden had been sort of deputized to lead these talks and you did note that he was still making phone calls from overseas.\xc2\xa0 But is this a sign the President is going to get more actively involved in these budget talks now that you\'re moving closer to another potential government shutdown?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the President has been involved.\xc2\xa0 The White House has been involved.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, as you know, has been involved --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How has the President been involved?\xc2\xa0 Was he making phone calls before?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In this broader debate about budgets and spending, the President has been engaged since the State of the Union, in discussions with members -- leaders, rather, from both parties.\xc2\xa0 You know he has had said members to the White House.\xc2\xa0 He has had discussions, some of which I have mentioned from here and read out from here; and multiple, multiple interactions, conversations, meetings between senior White House officials and congressional officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are engaged.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t read out every meeting and phone call.\xc2\xa0 The meetings and phone calls -- or the meeting, rather, and the phone calls that I mentioned today are happening and it\xe2\x80\x99s all aimed at the purpose of finding the common ground that we need so that we can fund the government for the rest of the year, with substantial spending cuts. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs you know, an important part of this process is occurring today, I believe, on Capitol Hill when the Senate votes on two measures -- the House -- H.R.1, as it\xe2\x80\x99s known -- the House Republican proposal, which will be voted on by the Senate, and then the Senate Democratic proposal which will be vote on.\xc2\xa0 And the outcome of those votes will, we think, help guide us forward in terms of the search for common ground. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd we look forward to that happening and we\'re working very hard to do what we think is very important, which is reach an agreement that funds the government, substantially reduces spending, continues to pay for the very things -- the very priorities that are important to keep the economy growing, to ensure that the economy is continuing to create the kind of jobs that we saw last Friday with the most recent jobs announcement, and that takes us through the end of the fiscal year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBecause it is simply \xe2\x80\x93 we are too great a country, with too large an economy, to be in a situation where we are negotiating whether or not the government will remain open every two or three weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow on Libya and no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Secretary Clinton did an interview with Sky News, where she was stressing that this cannot be a U.S.-led situation, it has to be multilateral.\xc2\xa0 And the reporter noted that other countries are involved -- the Arab League has gotten behind this, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So the reporter asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIn theory, the U.S. would support a no-fly zone?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And the Secretary said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are going to support the efforts that are being made.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d that the administration supports a no-fly zone?\xc2\xa0 Not that you\'re going to implement it, but that you support it, but you\'re just trying to figure out how to make it work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to refine the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xc2\xa0 What I have said from here and what others have said and I think she\xe2\x80\x99s made clear is that we\'re reviewing a variety of options; we\'re actively considering a no-fly zone --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said, we are going to support the efforts that are being made -- the word \xe2\x80\x9csupport\xe2\x80\x9d -- we\'re going to support the efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we will support in a coordinated way the actions of our international partners, which we have leading up to this point and we will going forward, because we are an elemental part of that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But international partners like Britain and France are suggesting they support a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 So if they\xe2\x80\x99re able to go on record and say they support it, why can\'t we?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\'re getting a little ahead of yourself in terms of the process of preparing for potential contingencies, evaluating options, even preparing language -- which I think you\'re referring to -- and a decision by the international community -- by NATO, by the U.N., by the United States, by its international partners -- to endorse and pursue a specific course of action.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference.\xc2\xa0 And we are working very closely with the British and the French and many, many other countries on this effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, let me follow up on Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question because this morning she went a bit further on The Early Show.\xc2\xa0 She said --when asked about all the different options that are on the table, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe think it\xe2\x80\x99s very\xe2\x80\x9d -- yeah, I\'m one-upping with everybody -- \xe2\x80\x9cWe think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that there be a U.N. decision on whatever might be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So she is basically saying that nothing is going to happen without U.N. approval, which means Security Council approval, and we already know that China and Russia are likely to veto anything.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a way of saying that we\'re satisfied with the status quo right now?\xc2\xa0 And is that administration position, that it has to come from the U.N., as she said?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our strong preference that actions we take are done in concert with our international partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she said U.N., not just international partners.\xc2\xa0 And that means Security Council, and that means Russia and China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just go back to the point.\xc2\xa0 It is our strong preference, in this situation and many others, that we act together with out international partners, because, collectively, we are stronger than we are individually in cases like this.\xc2\xa0 It is also obviously the case -- again, not referring to the specific action -- but it is obviously the case that we always reserve the right to act -- NATO does, rather, as the United States does, to act on its own.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let me just be careful and say that our strong preference and what we are working for right now is to work with the United Nations and other -- and NATO and all our international partners on the variety of considerations that are there, the variety of options that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just answer though -- does the President agree that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very important that there be a U.N. decision on whatever might be done\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is very important that we work together with the United Nations and other international organizations and our --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said that there be a U.N. decision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you walking back what she said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not walking back what she said at all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think I just would refer you to the State Department. But it is very important that we work with the United Nations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not what she said.\xc2\xa0 Again, she said there be a U.N. decision on whatever must be done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we are working with the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with the British and French.\xc2\xa0 We are working -- we are pursuing that course as we decide, collectively, what options we make take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On another topic, as you know, in the past, the President has talked about situations in which the U.S. has a moral obligation to intervene, not just intervention on behalf on U.S. national interests.\xc2\xa0 Is he looking through that lens at this situation in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Does he consider this a situation that could get to the point where the United States has a moral obligation to intervene?\xc2\xa0 Is that one of the ways he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I would say that the statements and the actions that have been taken by this President in the three weeks since this circumstance began in Libya demonstrate the moral outrage that we feel at the actions taken by the Libyan regime against its people.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly there is a moral component to not just the actions of the United States and the President of the United States but the actions of the entire international community, and its swift and coordinated reaction to and response to the despicable behavior of the Libyan regime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance he would stop by the principals meeting today?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a sense -- is there a vigorous debate going on back there over what to do or is it more waiting to see --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want me to break it down for you who\xe2\x80\x99s on what side and everything?\xc2\xa0 Would that be okay from here?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be great.\xc2\xa0 That would be really great.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re conceding that there are two sides --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not.\xc2\xa0 I am not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At least two.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More than two sides?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was really nice of you to offer that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These meetings -- again, let me go back to my original answer to the original question.\xc2\xa0 These meetings are held frequently in the Situation Room here at the White House, principals committee meetings -- I believe there was one just a couple of weeks ago -- and they are evaluating the various options in the situation in Libya and the broader region, and the various options that we have taken and are implementing, and others that remain on the table. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on the possibility the President will stop by.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not anticipated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Rice told \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America\xe2\x80\x9d today that U.S. would keep the pressure on Qaddafi until he falls.\xc2\xa0 Is this the regime change the President is so often skeptical of?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, Wendell, that we believe -- the President has said very forcefully that Muammar Qaddafi needs to leave, needs to step down.\xc2\xa0 He has lost the legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his people and in the eyes of the world.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can be any clearer than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Mary Landrieu want the President to extend the leases that were basically frozen after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico instead of reviewing them.\xc2\xa0 As I understand, all of the leases are being reviewed now individually.\xc2\xa0 Given the increases recently in the price of oil, is this something the President could support?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Since the oil spill in the Gulf -- a terrible, terrible oil spill in the Gulf, the worst in history -- we have ensured that future permits will be granted when there is a containment -- when there is -- the applicant shows an ability to handle through a containment procedure a spill.\xc2\xa0 We have, as you know, last month -- late last month, last week -- granted our first permit for deepwater drilling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the oil spill we have granted 37 permits, shallow water permits.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think many people realize this -- that domestic oil production last year rose to its highest level since 2003.\xc2\xa0 This administration has actively pursued all forms of energy production, precisely because we think it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, and to create the clean energy industries that will drive economic growth and job creation, and our national security through a reduction in foreign oil dependence in the future.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s my answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is tapping the SPR still being considered?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new on that.\xc2\xa0 We are monitoring the situation with oil prices.\xc2\xa0 We are confident that the global system has the capacity to deal with a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 We understand the impact that higher gasoline prices have on family budgets.\xc2\xa0 But I have nothing specifically to add except that that option is one we\xe2\x80\x99re considering, which we said before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could ask one more question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- ok, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I want to get everybody involved.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Wisconsin state Senate majority leader says the President\xe2\x80\x99s political team in Chicago is working to recall Wisconsin state Republican legislatures.\xc2\xa0 Any truth to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, Wendell, honestly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to try one more time Jake\xe2\x80\x99s line of questioning on NPR.\xc2\xa0 With the proliferation of media from all points of the political spectrum and all points of opinion, why is it important for the taxpayers to still continue to fund public broadcasting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear what our position is on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a debate about the merits of public broadcasting --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to engage in a debate, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Mike, the reality is that the administrations, both Republican and Democratic, have supported public broadcasting in the past, and we think in an era where tough choices have to be made, including the ones that this President laid out in his proposed 2012 budget, that there remains a need to support public broadcasting and NPR.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, Representative Peter King will have a hearing, obviously very controversial.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the Deputy National Security Advisor spoke on this over the weekend -- Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House object to the tone and the comments coming from Congressman King, or do you object to the fact that this hearing is being held at all?\xc2\xa0 Or what do you object to about this hearing, specifically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I have to take issue with your premise.\xc2\xa0 We have said that we welcome congressional involvement in this issue.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue.\xc2\xa0 The Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough spoke about our position on this issue and the violent extremism here in the United States, and made points that we think are very important, which is in the United States we do not practice guilt by association, A; B, we believe that Muslim Americans are part of the solution, they are not the problem.\xc2\xa0 It is through the helpful cooperation of Muslim Americans that we are able to effectively address this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the meeting with Democratic leaders today -- Joe Manchin, Diane Feinstein have been critical of what they describe as a lack of presidential involvement.\xc2\xa0 Is this meeting called in response to their criticism?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was it scheduled?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been scheduled for days.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President meets fairly regularly with leaders of Congress.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t throw in meetings based on comments from individual senators in 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 And I would just say that the debate that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Senate and the votes that will come out today in the Senate will give us an indication of where we need to go -- Congress and the White House -- to find the common ground that the American people want us to find so that we can reduce spending, tighten our belts, live within our means, and still fund the essential services of government, our national security, and make the investments that we need to make to continue growing; to make sure that the kind of growth we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last year plus and the kind of job creation we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last year continues -- because there is no plan, no proposal that will be effective in reducing the deficit or addressing our long-term fiscal issues if we don\xe2\x80\x99t grow and create jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions -- one on foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.N. arms embargo restrict the United States from sending arms to the Libyan rebels in the east?\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain has said that it should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to the government, but what is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the arms embargo contains within it the flexibility to allow for a decision to arm the opposition, if that decision were made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question, on the budget talks, what is the President hoping to come out of this meeting today with Democrats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He hopes to continue the process of finding the common ground that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made reference to from here, which is the kind of budget cuts that we can all agree on, that the American people expect us to make, in a continuing resolution that funds the government through the end of the year, maintains the investments in education and innovation and infrastructure that are essential to economic growth, and that does not include extraneous political or social issues that are not the focus of\xc2\xa0 -- a proper focus of a budget deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is Biden -- are Biden\xe2\x80\x99s calls specifically about the CR?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what time is the budget meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s early this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 It may be within the hour.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A minute ago, you used the statement \xe2\x80\x9clive within our means.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a statement President Obama used yesterday in Boston and has used often.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is a coincidence.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, what does he mean by that?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean a balanced budget when he says we need a government and a budget that helps us live within our means?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a technical matter, beyond the broadly understood sense of the term, which is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t spend more -- that you spend -- that you manage your budget responsibly, your inflow and your outflow, and I think as a specific matter, as we talked about in the early days after our budget release, our budget is designed to get to a point where we are taking in what we are spending.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I understand that we have this huge overhang of a national debt that requires substantial interest payments.\xc2\xa0 But you cannot -- one step in dealing with our fiscal situation, with our deficits and our long-term debt, is to get to a point where we are living within our means, spending only what we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what his budget proposal does, and he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it means it\xe2\x80\x99s a budget in balance except for interest on the debt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, if you -- and I assume this isn\xe2\x80\x99t true, but let\xe2\x80\x99s say your credit card bill arrived yesterday, and you have a substantial balance and an interest payment that you have to deal with.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re never going to get that under control if you go out tomorrow and drop another thousand dollars that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t earned -- despite being worth more than that in the work that you do from here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So the point is that it is part of being responsible -- financially responsible, fiscally responsible -- to get to the point where we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been for a while, I remind you, in the years prior to getting here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a golden era in an administration long, long ago when balanced budgets were created, where surpluses were created, where surpluses were envisioned as far as the eye could see -- 1999, 2000.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the circumstance that we inherited when we got here.\xc2\xa0 It is a circumstance we hope to get to at least in terms of the balance between inflow and outflow.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important milestone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m still not clear on what it means.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to see your checkbook.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the budget talks, Kevin McCarthy yesterday --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No gift for your sister.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin McCarthy suggested yesterday that there are talks among House and Senate leaders to extend the deadline from March 18th for another two, three, or even four weeks.\xc2\xa0 Is that being circulated here at the White House?\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\'ll tell you is that we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- I think you remember me saying and probably others prior to the recent CR that was signed that our desire was to have more time to allow for the negotiations that are necessary to reach the common ground that needs to be reached so we can get a deal through the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 That is still our goal.\xc2\xa0 How we get there -- I\'m not going to get into -- draw lines in the sand about what specifically we would support or not support.\xc2\xa0 But the overall point is important, which is the American people don\'t want us to get into a situation where we are going through these cycles of negotiations on how to make sure the government\xe2\x80\x99s bills are being paid every second Monday, or every third Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we need to get very soon to the hard work, the important work, but the achievable work of negotiating a budget deal that funds the government through the end of the year, cuts spending substantially, in a way that all sides can agree on, and that maintains the important investments to keep our economy growing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re keeping that door open for that, then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to broaden the budget talks, as some Senate Democrats have suggested, to include more than just this tiny slice of the budget that you\'re focusing on now?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s often said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, that\'s an excellent question.\xc2\xa0 In the State of the Union he talked about even as he was proposing a budget -- or was going to propose a budget which would have substantial cuts in non-defense discretionary spending, he came out in front of a large audience to make the point that the non-defense discretionary budget is 12 percent of our overall budget, and there is no way to get from here to there responsibly in terms of restoring our fiscal sanity, you might say, if you don\'t address the bigger issues.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 And he welcomes the input that other leaders in Washington are providing in that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd he, as I think I said from here on Monday, welcomes the statement by the Speaker of the House in the Wall Street Journal on Friday that dealing with those bigger issues that affect our long-term debt -- entitlement spending, interest, defense -- as well as tax expenditures, that we all need to link arms and do it together.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, at some point.\xc2\xa0 But yesterday several leading Senate Democrats said that these negotiations that we\'re talking about now for the CR need to be broadened to talk about things that are mandatory and not just domestic non-discretionary.\xc2\xa0 So does he think that is premature?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say that we welcome the input from members and look forward to getting to the point where we are talking about reaching a deal on a continuing resolution that funds the government through the fiscal year, so that we can move on to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that has to come first?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not making a dividing line.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think that anyone thinks between now and March 18th we will resolve entitlement reform, tax expenditures, and all the other issues that go into a much bigger deal.\xc2\xa0 But the elements that would go into a fiscal year 2011 agreement I don\'t want to negotiate from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President then -- to follow up on Mara -- is it waiting for the House Republicans to put forward their broad budget before it would be prepared to enter into broader negotiations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jackie, we are in a situation, as we were last week, where the government shuts down on March 18th -- I mean, we\'re not -- we need to resolve the issue on the table, which is funding for fiscal year 2011.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re not waiting for anything to get to those talks.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re eager to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the broader negotiations -- he\xe2\x80\x99s put out his budget, so now --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re asking me a version of what Mara said, which is -- and I\'m not, from here, separating the near term from the short term, except that we don\'t have a choice but to deal with the near term funding posed by the short-term extension. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGo ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before you get to that near point, how worried are you that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be up against the President\xe2\x80\x99s departure to South America?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe -- and that\'s also the beginning of a congressional recess, I think.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that -- we have made clear, the President has made clear, that it is an economic -- would be incredibly harmful to the economy if we were to have a shutdown of the government.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want one.\xc2\xa0 Congressional leaders don\'t want one.\xc2\xa0 They have said so, both parties.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we can work out a deal that avoids one, as we did last week.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we think, as I said and I\'ll say one more time, it would not be good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It would create a great deal of uncertainty if we were to continue this exercise, repeat this exercise every two weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Budget Office scoring of your proposal from last week, they don\'t see $2 billion worth of savings that you said were in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We supported the Democratic proposal that was put forward -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t our proposal but it was the Senate Democratic proposal.\xc2\xa0 We have come halfway, the White House and the Democrats, with slightly separate proposals.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t match up dollar for dollar in the cuts.\xc2\xa0 The point is the Senate proposal will be voted on today -- the Senate Democratic proposal will be voted on today.\xc2\xa0 After the outcome of that vote, we will then receive I think a clear indication of the kind of -- where we need to go.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear he is willing to do more.\xc2\xa0 It is I think essential and incumbent upon the Republicans to show that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to move, as we have, as the Democrats have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBecause that\'s what the American people expect.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t expect in a negotiation or a compromise or the finding of common ground that -- they expect both sides to give, both sides to make tough choices, to come together, to do the business the people sent us here to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that\'s the difference between the Senate proposal and your proposal.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what explains the CBO --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that -- because you described it as \xe2\x80\x9cour\xe2\x80\x9d proposal, and I just wanted to make clear that, first of all, we have never formally laid out -- we made clear that we -- had indicated additional cuts that we supported or could live with, another $6.5 billion in cuts.\xc2\xa0 The Senate -- the Senate is a sovereign organization.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Democrats produced their own budget that didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\'m just saying, line for line it didn\xe2\x80\x99t mirror necessarily the same cuts. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe support it.\xc2\xa0 We want the Senate to vote on it.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll proceed from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we just follow over here --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just move around here.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t been\xc2\xa0 -- yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third row.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Third row.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions, please.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the fact that Gary Locke is Chinese-American, does the President believe this will make him more effective as an ambassador to China?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President had an announcement today where he spoke.\xc2\xa0 His words are far more important than mine on this issue.\xc2\xa0 He obviously thinks Secretary Locke will be an excellent ambassador.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of very important ambassadorial posts around the globe, and this is top shelf, as you might say.\xc2\xa0 So his background, his range of experiences, his -- what he brings to this job make him ideally suited to fill it.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that matters more than the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese-American, or that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rank it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese-American --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking, does it matter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Locke spoke about how it matters to him and it obviously matters to us that he brings that as part of who he is to the job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask you, on Guantanamo,\xc2\xa0 does the President believe that Americans want that detention center closed?\xc2\xa0 And does he have any hope for the possibility that it can still happen during his term?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t make his position based on polling, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.\xc2\xa0 What he firmly believes is that it is in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest, in our national security interest, as many military leaders have said and, as I would remind you, the previous administration said towards its end, that we should close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, and that remains his position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And based on the logic that he explained at the time, I wonder if you think or he thinks that simply declaring that he wanted it closed and that he still wants it closed achieves part of the goal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position is well known in the United States and around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And again, it is a position that\xe2\x80\x99s not ours alone or his alone.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s shared by military leaders and was expressed by the previous administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are obviously obstacles to that.\xc2\xa0 We understand the reality that we\xe2\x80\x99re living in and that this is a difficult issue. But it remains his goal.\xc2\xa0 He remains committed to seeing that facility closed, in the interest of America\xe2\x80\x99s national security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one of the members of that sovereign organization, the Senate, Chuck Schumer, who the President will presumably see today, has proposed putting entitlements on the table as well as certain tax hikes.\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about that?\xc2\xa0 And a second question from another sovereign, Dick Lugar yesterday said that he felt the United States could not afford, in a fiscal sense, any intervention in Libya. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to your question about Senator Schumer.\xc2\xa0 I would just say what I said to Mara, which is we welcome the thoughtful input of lawmakers on this issue.\xc2\xa0 It is vitally important that we all recognize what the President made clear in his State of the Union, which -- you cannot get your fiscal house in order if you only go after 12 percent of the budget, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what non-defense discretionary spending amounts to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the more people who recognize the seriousness of this and the kind of steps that have to be taken the better, because, as he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear, we have to do this together.\xc2\xa0 We have to get in the boat together and row in the same direction, with everyone sitting down and not standing up so the boat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tip over.\xc2\xa0 And he remains committed to that goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, what was your second question, Glenn?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Senator Lugar said that one of the factors we should consider in Libya is the cost.\xc2\xa0 He said we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we consider all the factors, all the elements.\xc2\xa0 And one of things I got at I think yesterday on the plane and the day before from here, and others have, is that -- Secretary Gates -- is that what\xe2\x80\x99s important when we consider these options that have memorable phrases attached to them like no-fly zone is that these are substantial undertakings that require assets and potentially put Americans and the forces of our international partners in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 And obviously they also cost money.\xc2\xa0 So all these factors are things that we consider as we develop a set of options and potentially pursue one or the other.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to AFRICOM.\xc2\xa0 How often does the President talk to the commanders of AFRICOM?\xc2\xa0 How often does he talk to Kip Ward, who is now commander there, and you have Carter Ham now commanding that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I have to take that.\xc2\xa0 Defense might know.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a chain of command.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, as far as I know, have regular scheduled contacts with different regional commanders.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- I could find out for you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, especially right now, AFRICOM is very important because administration sources are saying that this, if indeed there were to be some way to enforce a no-fly zone and to deal with military options, the U.S.-Africa command center would be the lead.\xc2\xa0 So with that, do you know anything of how the President is communicating, how is he getting information from AFRICOM?\xc2\xa0 And also, not only just with Libya, there are other issues with Cote d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire.\xc2\xa0 There are other issues within Africa. Is the President being apprised of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, absolutely he\xe2\x80\x99s being apprised of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening multiple times a day in terms of Libya and the whole region, as well at Cote d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire.\xc2\xa0 The AFRICOM is not an independent entity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the military command structure. And he speaks with his defense secretary and his commanders regularly.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information for you in terms of his specific communications with one command.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Is there somewhat of a study or some type of assessment on the psychological costs on the soldiers to go into combat again and the possibility to do more combat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Forgive me if this came up Monday.\xc2\xa0 I might just be spacing on it.\xc2\xa0 When Denis McDonough spoke on Sunday, he made a reference to the fact that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach to domestic radicalization would be forthcoming within the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you know what he was talking about.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys getting ready to unveil something new?\xc2\xa0 Or what -- I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- do you know anything more about that?\xc2\xa0 Should we expect --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what Mr. McDonough said, so -- I think that we have made clear that we take this issue very seriously.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue.\xc2\xa0 We have been engaging in it or evaluating it for some time.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons I think that -- because people had talked about the timing of Mr. McDonough\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 The timing was associated with where we are in the process of that review of the situation, which we think is very -- is an important one.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he spoke.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on what specifically he was referring to that I can announce from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there something -- even regarding policy --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I can announce.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you spoke to us on Monday, has the U.S. government been able to reach any clarity about the makeup from the aspirations of the various Libyan opposition factions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say more than I said, which is that we are in contact with opposition groups, individuals and groups, through various channels.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the King hearings, I guess I -- I know we heard from McDonough and I know that the feeling is that there is no -- there is still outreach to the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 But they are, for whatever reason, they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling demonized, that there is this guilt by association whether the administration is vouching for it or not.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear from the President on this? Obviously Muslim engagement is something that the President has been working on throughout this administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he has.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that the fact that Mr. McDonough went out and gave the speech when he did, where he did, reinforces the message that he carried, which is that it is our belief, this administration\xe2\x80\x99s belief, that, A, as I said, in the United States of America, we do not practice guilt by association; and B, that, in fact, in dealing with this issue, Muslim Americans are very much a part of the solution and not the problem.\xc2\xa0 And that is our position.\xc2\xa0 And obviously Congressman King should answer for himself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, David.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, can we -- but will we hear from the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement on when he might speak next.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, David.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A few minutes ago, Speaker Boehner put out a tweet saying -- this is it in its entirety -- \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans have one message for their elected leaders:\xc2\xa0 Cut spending now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House response to that?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s where the political debate now is?\xc2\xa0 One message about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think in the 140 characters allowed in a tweet there is room to add -- and I would say that Americans want spending cut and they want responsible government and they do not want actions taken in Washington that would undermine the recovery that we have fought so hard to achieve and that we are in the process of seeing, including the substantial private sector job growth that we saw last Friday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s more than 140 characters.\xc2\xa0 But if you put it into one of those condensers -- (laughter) --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s cheating, but nevertheless --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Americans want us to responsibly cut spending and not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to hold you to 140 characters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and not tank the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But do you think the debate is such that the emphasis has become unduly put on the cutting part of that equation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- more importantly, the President thinks that cutting spending is important, and he made that clear.\xc2\xa0 There is no disagreement here in Washington or around the country that we need to reduce our spending to deal with our deficits.\xc2\xa0 And I would remind you, again, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget that he put forward does two things:\xc2\xa0 It cuts spending and it reduces the deficit, which is a challenge that not every plan that we have heard, specific or otherwise, can meet.\xc2\xa0 So his commitment is clear.\xc2\xa0 His commitment to work with Republicans and Democrats to find common ground is clear.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged in that process now.\xc2\xa0 He is optimistic that we can find that common ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on the budget --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move around to some folks that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 On the meeting with the Democratic leaders, you said they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach common ground.\xc2\xa0 Are they trying to reach common ground among Democrats or common ground with something that\xe2\x80\x99s palatable to the Republicans in the House and Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My reference to common ground was everybody -- Republicans, Democrats -- coming together for a final resolution of this issue of funding the government through the end of the fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 This meeting is part of that process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on Libya, Jay, with Guantanamo Bay, the executive order earlier in the week, and with Congressman King\xe2\x80\x99s hearings, is there any -- is this making the delicate line the White House is trying to make in Libya more difficult?\xc2\xa0 Are these two domestic decisions making the President\xe2\x80\x99s work more difficult internationally?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 On Libya, the U.S. has been communicating with European allies.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any plans to communicate with your Asian allies such as Japan in light of the -- in light of G8 foreign ministers meeting in Paris?\xc2\xa0 And second, in Okinawa, Japan, where U.S. based is located, there was a comment by senior U.S. State Department official on Okinawa made to U.S. students saying that the people in Okinawa are lazy, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 What --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that comment, so I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the spectrum of communications we\xe2\x80\x99re having on Libya, I might also ask you to either check back with us, the national security staff, or with the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, in the back.\xc2\xa0 Final row, striped shirt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the no-fly zone, the big push seems to be coming from Britain and France.\xc2\xa0 And the situation is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of articulated that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to wait to get this right.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration -- is it fair to characterize that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be the cooler head, or is there a concern that other nations are too quick to over-commit NATO resources, which are mostly U.S. resources?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our international partners, the British and the French, and we are moving together, together.\xc2\xa0 And the leadership the United States has shown has been quite clear, as I think I pointed out and I think I reminded you at the beginning, or relatively close to the beginning, that it was the United States that initiated the meetings at the NAC, at NATO in Brussels, where a lot of these military options have been under consideration.\xc2\xa0 So we are coordinating with our international partners, and that includes, obviously, the British and the French.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question -- I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 One real quick one on public broadcasting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on public broadcasting.\xc2\xa0 From an alternative perspective, I mean, could the case be made that since only 2 percent of the funding comes from the federal government that could be a long-term benefit for public broadcasting to cut the purse strings from political pressure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to my statement before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Second question:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some conflicting reports on where the White House stands with regards to Dr. Berwick at CMS.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House still committed to seeing that through to confirmation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything, which is not meant to connote anything except that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 So let me take that question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.*<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is tax cuts so much of a mantra when it didn\xe2\x80\x99t create jobs over the last decade and 40 percent of the stimulus was tax cuts?\xc2\xa0 And do you agree with Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s news conference yesterday that oil subsidies and foreign subsidies could be alternative ways to cut the budget?\xc2\xa0 And thirdly, is Social Security off the table now that people are starting to realize that not a dime of the deficit comes from Social Security and it\xe2\x80\x99s fully paid for 30 years?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the tax cuts that this President has proposed and supported and signed into law have had a very positive impact on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The ones that were included in the Recovery Act helped us get out of a situation where this economy was experiencing dramatic negative growth -- it was shrinking; where job loss was as high as 740,000 or 750,000 a month -- to a situation now where we have real economic growth and real job growth, and have had for a sustained period of time.\xc2\xa0 And we think that the payroll tax holiday, the payroll tax cut that every American received as a result of the tax cut deal, the bipartisan tax cut deal that was reached in December, which the President signed, has had a salutary effect on growth in this quarter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we think they are part of the package.\xc2\xa0 And I would remind you that this President has passed something on the order of 14 or 17 small business tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 So they are part of the puzzle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the broader -- it is true that, as I think our budget director has said, that Social Security is not the problem when it comes to our near-term deficits, our annual deficits.\xc2\xa0 It is, however, an issue in terms of its long-term solvency and health.\xc2\xa0 And this is a vital program that we intend to make stronger as we address the overall issue of entitlement reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on Libya for a second.\xc2\xa0 You keep mentioning NATO.\xc2\xa0 Is intervention in Libya something that can be sold as the purview of NATO, and is that a strong line of possible action you\xe2\x80\x99re pursing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just back up here and make clear that we -- first of all, we are not at a decision point.\xc2\xa0 We are considering these options.\xc2\xa0 We are actively considering a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 We are very committed to pursuing a process by which the options that we do decide on are -- that we work with our international partners to take them and implement them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBeyond that, distinctions between -- NATO is obviously a military alliance and that is a fit place for discussing the military options that we have.\xc2\xa0 It is also vital, we believe, very important to the whole way that we deal with the unrest in the region that the international community broadly is part of this; that it is not just the West, it is not just the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it has not been and that has been a great virtue.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a virtue that we hope to continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOkay, last one.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the upcoming anniversary of the oil spill last summer, I wonder is the President satisfied with the current level of new regulation over the oil industry and the level of preparedness for another potential incident like we saw last year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just refer you to the -- I forget who asked the question about drilling -- that we take very seriously the need to have the regulations in place that will help prevent the kind of environmental disaster that we had because of the Deepwater spill; that the containment facilities are adequate.\xc2\xa0 And that is why those companies that have sought leases for deepwater drilling have had to prove that they have that capacity. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we, as I mentioned, approved the first lease since that process -- those regulations were implemented last week.\xc2\xa0 We are very much interested in responsible but effective oil exploration and recovery, and that is why we have approved 37 shallow-water permits and why overall, as I noted, domestic oil production is at its -- last year was at its highest level since 2003.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it for me, folks.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the bullying conference tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>\n\t1:49 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
