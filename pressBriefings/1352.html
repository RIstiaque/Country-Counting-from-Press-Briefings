BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard, flight to Buffalo.\xc2\xa0 In his remarks, the President will talk about the economic crisis and some of the steps that he and the administration have taken to get us out of it.\xc2\xa0 During the economic crisis, the President and his allies in Congress were forced to make some politically difficult decisions to get our economy back on track.\xc2\xa0 As a result of those actions, we\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to see jobs created and the economy growing.</p>\n<p>The President will talk about the actions that were taken and also point out that many of his vocal opponents stood on the sidelines just predicting failure.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll urge Congress to act on additional jobs legislation, and say that it should not fall victim to the same partisan posturing we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the course of the last year.</p>\n<p>So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>There is, on the logistics -- you guys should all have the backgrounder.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, when we get into cell coverage, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it, about the places where we\xe2\x80\x99re going and what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing and all that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, it seems like every once in a while we get these White House to Main Street trips, you go out and you talk about jobs, which you promised to do full-time at the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 What pressure is the Obama White House putting on Congress to actually pass a jobs bill?\xc2\xa0 What are you doing besides having the President make speeches every once in a while to say they ought to do it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Sheryl, the President and his team are working every day to try to advance jobs legislation.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out some of the things that he thought could actually get some jobs created; create an environment where small businesses can create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s some of what he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about today.</p>\n<p>But as you can imagine, his team is working with members of Congress of both parties to actually make some progress on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we seeing any progress?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that if you look at the jobs report from last week, 290,000 jobs would suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no bill.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s actually been quite a few initiatives that have passed through country to create jobs, and I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see some of the results of that.</p>\n<p>I would suggest that you check out some of the things that have passed through Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, Mark Zandi was predicting I guess yesterday that the unemployment rate will go over 10 percent again as more people reenter the workforce.\xc2\xa0 Does that jibe with what your prognostic -- your predictions are as far as the economy is concerned?\xc2\xa0 And double-digit unemployment as we head into November, what problems does that present to you in keeping majorities in the House and Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that creating jobs isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing for the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s doing it because you -- because without jobs, the economy is not going to be strong; Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to pay for -- make their mortgage payments, pay for college tuition, pay for their energy consumption.\xc2\xa0 So jobs are critically important, not just as a political tool.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave the predictions about specific numbers to the experts at CEA.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that one of the realities of so many jobs being lost is that, as a result, many Americans decided that -- many Americans decided to stop looking for jobs.\xc2\xa0 And as they get added back into the workforce, they\xe2\x80\x99re factored into those numbers on the unemployment rate.</p>\n<p>So basically that number is a demonstration of us being a victim of the success of actually creating jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about who he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with and what he wants to tell them, in terms of the families or relatives?\xc2\xa0 Or who are they, Flight 3407?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 When we land, the President will be talking with some of the families from Flight 3407.\xc2\xa0 It will be a brief meeting where the President is looking to extend his condolences.</p>\n<p>Throughout -- for the past year, Secretary LaHood, Administrator Babbitt and others have met with the families, along with senior DOT and FAA officials about 10 times.\xc2\xa0 And this is just an opportunity for the President to see these families face to face.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he done this before, Bill, met with families of accidents where the government was not involved?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You can -- we were just at the mine tragedy in West Virginia where he did, and early in the administration he had a meeting with the families who were victims of the USS Cole, and the 9/11 families as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Greek debt crisis, has the President made any more calls to European leaders?\xc2\xa0 And also, today Chancellor Merkel said it was -- called it an existential crisis that threatened the euro zone.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that view, and is he concerned that it might spill over into the U.S. economy?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99m qualified to comment on existential crises.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that the President has been concerned about and deeply engaged in, having called leaders in Europe to discuss aggressive measures that ought to be taken and that they are taking in order to make sure that their economy and the euro is strong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In New York tonight, how much is he expected to raise?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DNC for the numbers on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the oil spill hearings that have been going on, are there contingency plans in place for the administration for some of these leases that are going to come online later this summer past this 30-day report Salazar has?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, fellow Buffalonian Julie Pace of the Associated Press, I would point you to the Department of Interior for any plans on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration working with them to come up with plans past this 30-day Salazar report?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean, our focus right now is plugging that hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and obviously finding out what caused it and what we can do to mitigate any of the environmental damage.\xc2\xa0 On a parallel track, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at what we do going forward.\xc2\xa0 But the key thing happening right now is this interagency report on what exactly went down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About tonight, is there any hypocrisy about raising money with Wall Street executives presumably on the heels -- in light of Wall Street reform being still discussed?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a big presumably.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the guest list of who will be there.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that the President is going to New York City, as he\xe2\x80\x99s gone around the country before, to talk about issues that are of key concern, and part of being the leader of your party is helping to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the resources in order to be competitive with the person they\xe2\x80\x99re running against.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of folks who will be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this issue of the security funding, the transit funding being cut for New York City -- response?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to point out that one in three dollars that are being spent on port and transit security from the recovery plan are going to New York City.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re receiving an increase of some $47 million.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact with the congressional delegation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously working closely with Mayor Bloomberg on these issues.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a sheet that I will give you all on the money and where it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from for New York City.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reports out of New York and some members of Congress --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Members -- Chuck Schumer -- I mean, members of your own party.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s an aggressive advocate for the people of New York.\xc2\xa0 He probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want just one of three dollars going to New York state, he wants three of three dollars.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his job, to want all that money for New York State.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is making sure that New York has the resources that they need in order to keep their transit and ports safe.</p>\n<p>Hold on, brace.\xc2\xa0 You guys hold on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the President is doing a lot of fundraising but not a whole lot of campaigning.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 What about Hawaii -- the House seat?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The special election in his hometown.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no plan to do that at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much campaigning -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really seen him out there for that many candidates just yet, but we have seen him raising money.\xc2\xa0 When are we going to see that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen him out there for Senator Boxer.\xc2\xa0 Some of you guys were on that trip, too.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid.\xc2\xa0 He was in Indiana.\xc2\xa0 He was in Florida.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he actually has been doing some campaigning.\xc2\xa0 And as we get closer to the midterms, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that increase.\xc2\xa0 But as you can imagine, there\xe2\x80\x99s more than a few things on his plate right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President called anybody else about Greece and Europe?\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that part of the question.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did call --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Medvedev this morning.\xc2\xa0 You guys will get a paper readout on that shortly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was it about?\xc2\xa0 Can we have an oral readout?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll get a paper readout on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this billboard in Buffalo, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. President, I need a freakin\xe2\x80\x99 job?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I saw a picture of that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President is here to talk about jobs, what his administration has done to create jobs, what we need to do in order to create an environment where small businesses can create jobs.\xc2\xa0 So the answer is, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the path to creating more jobs, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more work to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of your fellow Buffalonians are a little disappointed at the brevity of this visit.\xc2\xa0 Why so brief a visit?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I share their disappointment.\xc2\xa0 If it were up to me, we\xe2\x80\x99d stay here for a week and I\xe2\x80\x99d be able to take the President all over town and see all the great places to eat, maybe even go to Niagara Falls.\xc2\xa0 But as I said before, the President has a lot on his plate.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s coming here to have what he hopes is a very robust discussion about the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re spending every second that we can in this great American city.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When are we going to get the readout on the Medvedev call?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You might already have it, actually.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just quickly tell us what it was about?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I wish I had details for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 But as you know, START is going up to the Senate today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 hopefully --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jobs in the afternoon, money at night.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There you go.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:32 P.M.
