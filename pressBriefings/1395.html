GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I think as the weather gets nicer we might want to move this -- like class, we should move this outside and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, wow, everybody is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go for it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, I will -- wow, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that would be so easily accepted.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Without objection, so ordered, and I will have WHCA start setting that up.\xc2\xa0 That sounds like a great idea.\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 That sounds good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now we\'ve broken all the news, let\xe2\x80\x99s move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, a few questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support the idea of the House passing the health care bill without actually ever voting on it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, I think as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss repeatedly over these past couple of weeks, this week there will be a final vote on health care.\xc2\xa0 There will be an up or down vote on where we are on health care, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to reform our health care system.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is -- that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what -- that\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to members to gain their support for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a scenario unfolding in which the House would vote on the fix it bill, as you know, but never actually vote on the underlying Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 And the House Speaker has been candid about that.\xc2\xa0 If that happens, would the President be okay with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ben, I -- there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a vote on health care reform this week.\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to know where people are on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 There, I\'m sure, are those that are going to want to make this about the legislative process rather than the heart-wrenching stories of people like Natoma Canfield that the President discussed yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But the vote that we have on health care this week -- and I\'m not under the impression that the House has made up its mind on what that process is going to be, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it -- but I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that people -- this would be a final vote on health care.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll know where health care is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, along with policy, has said that process is important, too, to the American people -- transparency.\xc2\xa0 So when you say a vote -- I think -- don\'t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that there be a vote on the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t think anybody is going to be -- I don\'t think anybody is going to misinterpret the outcome as to where people are on health care.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate I\'ll get questions today on who the President is speaking with and who\xe2\x80\x99s he meeting with, and you\'re going to ask me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But -- and you want to know that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me finish my point.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re going to want to know where they are on health care.\xc2\xa0 When you do your whip counts, you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out who\xe2\x80\x99s where on health care.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine there\xe2\x80\x99s many Republican strategists that you all will interview this week that will say -- we won\xe2\x80\x99t look at the vote that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be had on Friday or so and it\xe2\x80\x99s not about health care.</p>\n<p>So, again, the President is focused on, after having worked on this for a year, getting this done; focusing on the stories that he repeated yesterday outside of Cleveland on behalf of people like Natoma Canfield; and believes that the stakes are higher than the next election or somebody\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to follow, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President meeting with and speaking with?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you brought it up.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Undecided members of Congress who will vote later this week on health care reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is he -- just to follow up on that, when he does meet with lawmakers, particularly one on one, what is he offering them in exchange for their votes, if anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Offering the case for why health care reform should be passed this year; offering the case of why 60 percent of small businesses will receive a tax cut in helping provide their employees with health care; offering the case for why the mother of a young child won\xe2\x80\x99t sit on the phone anymore with an insurance company arguing about a so-called preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Those are the types of anecdotes that the President will be offering members of Congress about why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to put aside the day-to-day politics, put aside the next election, put aside your poll numbers, and instead focus on the problems that the American people have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s just making that case for the bill?\xc2\xa0 No quid pro quo?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he making headway?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On China --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a quick follow please?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get around.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for a while, I presume.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to move to China, and if the administration has any reaction to the bill that\xe2\x80\x99s being put to the Senate by Schumer and Graham.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the text of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw the President mentioned just a few days ago that he wished and hoped that China approached their currency using a more market-based interpretation, and I would point you to the Treasury for any further announcements on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there does seem to be rising rhetoric here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is the President concerned this could undermine efforts to get China to collaborate in the G20, or even escalate into a trade war?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, believes that diplomatic relationships sometimes come with disagreement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading about a few recently.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t curtail our ability to work on problems of mutual concern like the global economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President still believe, as he said in the campaign, that China does manipulate its currency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would refer you to what the President said just a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I just want to push a little bit on this up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 I mean, just again yesterday the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo look, Ohio, that\xe2\x80\x99s the proposal.\xc2\xa0 And I believe Congress owes the American people a final up or down vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a final up or down vote plus -- using a deem and pass procedure.\xc2\xa0 He is promising the American people repeatedly in the last couple of weeks, including in the East Room with the doctors in the white coats, a straight up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 Why are you not being clear with the American people about what you want the House to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, we\xe2\x80\x99re being clear.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re being clear with the people of the United States and with Congress that there is going to be a vote this week, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to know how people are -- where they stand on health care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it may not be a vote on the actual legislation.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this I think is a legislative process game that people play --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a process --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Let me just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why won\xe2\x80\x99t Democrats go on the record about this legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, Ed, let me just make this point.\xc2\xa0 I am sure that CNN is going to be filled with stories between now and when that vote happens about where people are on that vote.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking people where they are on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get -- find out what meetings are happening here so you can ask people where they are on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this vote is going to be about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to know where people are on health care reform, on where they are on the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal on health care reform, not on where they are on a rule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also -- that part is true, leading up to the vote, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been a fundamental part of this republic that basically at the end of a long debate like this, there is an up or down vote --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the American people want to know what people are doing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand this is a -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not under the impression the House made a final decision.\xc2\xa0 That announcement, a decision --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- off the table then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll make that announcement.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll make that decision.\xc2\xa0 But understand, Ed, again, we hear the same process arguments from the same people that used very similar arguments on their side of this in many previous Congresses.\xc2\xa0 So again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit like reconciliation -- I was against it; before I was for it; and now you point out that it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the weight of your arguments are so much on the right side of history, why not just go before the American people and say here\xe2\x80\x99s an up or down vote on legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I don\'t think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- I don\'t think when you go out into the public next week after the legislation passes and ask people how they feel about their congressman\xe2\x80\x99s vote -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be asking them how they feel about their congressman\xe2\x80\x99s or congresswoman\xe2\x80\x99s vote on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be asking them because that\xe2\x80\x99s what this vote is about.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, without getting into specific numbers, can you tell us what percentage of the President\xe2\x80\x99s day he\xe2\x80\x99s actually devoting to making these calls and what kind of a reception he\xe2\x80\x99s getting?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he getting a lot of pushback?\xc2\xa0 Are these long conversations?\xc2\xa0 Are they short?\xc2\xa0 What are the nature of these calls?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Longer with some than others.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In English?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon me?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In English?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to other words?\xc2\xa0 No, this is children-approved programming, Helen.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I have not gotten a list of members that he\xe2\x80\x99s called today, but I know he reached out -- well, obviously he talked with Representative Kucinich yesterday on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked with and called -- either met with or called members over the past several days and, again, made the case for why reform is important now; why this has to be the time where we finally do something about health care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how is that argument being received?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we are making steady progress toward passage of the bill this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this is -- his entire day is devoted to making these calls?\xc2\xa0 Is it half the day?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a sense since we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing him at all.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back and look at his -- at the in-depth schedule to give you an educated guess on percentage, but -- no, I mean, look, the President, again, has a PDB every day; we had a senior advisors meeting and he\xe2\x80\x99s got stuff later today that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deal with health care.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President considered pulling out of these horrible wars where innocent people are killed, and take care of the desperate needs in this country -- in the cities, on health, education and welfare?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Helen, obviously relating to Iraq, we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99re on a path to getting our combat troops out of there by the end of August.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in both Iraq and Afghanistan we obviously are -- we have apologized on numerous occasions for the loss of innocent life.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- replace a human life?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it certainly does -- those are the type of actions that you obviously regret.\xc2\xa0 I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Ambassador Eikenberry and General McChrystal say those exact things to civilians in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that we would not be in Afghanistan if the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was in our strong national interest to do so.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the other part of your question, I think the President has outlined a robust agenda for improving health care reform in this country -- or improving health care in this country for -- we\'ve laid out many ways to improve our educational system and make our children more competitive and ready for either a career or college at the end of high school, and to address other problems that the President believes have been neglected for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no money for these needs, no money.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\'ve made some tough decisions about how to pay for health care reform, different than has been done in the last few years in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We believe there are priorities the President should pay for, and we have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You talked earlier about what the President is offering people when he makes these calls.\xc2\xa0 Is he offering to campaign in their districts and to come out and raise money for them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on the case that he will make and the case that he hopes everyone makes on why this legislation is important for the American people, and important for the constituents of their district.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been numerous reports that he and/or the White House have made specific offers to campaign and raise money for wavering Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Are these reports incorrect?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s also been reports that we won\'t campaign for people that don\'t, which are also --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are those incorrect?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those are incorrect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has not made any --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not been in every meeting, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President is focused on outlining the merits on behalf of the legislation and the policy that, again, will cut costs for the American people, make health care more affordable and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on that, but is he also, at the end of the call, saying, hey, I\'ll campaign for you, I\'ll raise money for you?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume we\'ll campaign for many people.\xc2\xa0 Some will vote for it, and some will vote against it.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend his time doing scheduling and political events.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a quid pro quo?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I said that earlier to Ben that that was not the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not a quid pro quo?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make campaigning or raising money contingent upon how they vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is focused on the legislation at hand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said Speaker Pelosi will make the decision or will announce the decision on how the House proceeds procedurally on this.\xc2\xa0 Is the President involved in any way in making that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are people in the White House involved in making that decision --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume that we have been involved for many, many months on getting health care done.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of all the conversations, whether they\xe2\x80\x99ve weighed in on process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say the final decision is hers, though, not the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think the final decision is the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, on the special deals, last week one day you went through the different states where there had been special deals -- Nebraska and Louisiana and Vermont and Montana.\xc2\xa0 Do you stand by the list of deals that were taken out of the legislation last week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to look at it again.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any reason to believe --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President still fighting to keep those special deals out of this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve taken quite a bit out of there and have asked the Senate to take anything else out that, again, I think as you saw people outline, would benefit one place or one state rather than something that can be -- that can affect a broader group of people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about Montana, for example?\xc2\xa0 Does the President support keeping that in?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I addressed that last week on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but do you stand by it now still?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe this deem and pass scenario constitutes an up or down vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask people how they stand on health care.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to ask them how they stand on deem and pass.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a vote count that constructs not the process for the rule but where you are on health care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys would be satisfied.\xc2\xa0 Since you\xe2\x80\x99ve extolled the virtues of an up or down vote, you would be satisfied with this deem and pass scenario?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- I think that -- again, I think there are many that would want to conflate this process into something that\xe2\x80\x99s different than the product; that is different than the heart-wrenching stories of people, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, like Natoma Canfield, who made decisions to give up her -- who made a decision to give up her health care to keep her house, a gamble that she\xe2\x80\x99s lost.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I ask about the up or down vote because Speaker Pelosi said -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting -- \xe2\x80\x9cI like it, this scenario, because people don\'t have to vote on the Senate bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would ask one of her --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m interested in how you would square those two concepts.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would ask one of her capable spokespeople on what she had to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but wait -- all right, but would you agree that there seems to be some inconsistency between what she said and the notion of an up or down vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to one of her capable spokespeople.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, then real quickly, just -- do you -- would you agree that it exacerbates the perception --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that this is a dirty or underhanded process?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting today that the Israelis are considering even more settlement activity after their announcement during the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip there last week.\xc2\xa0 What is the reaction of the Obama administration to this latest increase in settlement activity?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 These are reports of?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to base my comments off of would-be reports of.\xc2\xa0 I\'m certainly happy to comment at some point based on whether or not the \xe2\x80\x9creports of\xe2\x80\x9d are actual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that last week, the Vice President was in Israel to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the security of Israel and its people.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier mature, bilateral relationships can have disagreements.\xc2\xa0 And this is one of those disagreements.\xc2\xa0 It does not break the unbreakable bond that we have with the Israeli government and with the Israeli people on their security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have, throughout this process, hoped to engender the type of trust between the two sides that would lead to sitting down and discussing directly these issues.\xc2\xa0 Events on either side that complicate that we condemn on either side.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back around.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said that the problem with the politics of the health care bill is not with policy but with process.\xc2\xa0 So what is the difference between a deem and pass or a self-enacting rule, and the kind of process that the President was condemning when he made those statements?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we were -- I think the President was talking about the end of the Senate bill on some of the deals that Chip asked me about that are gone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the deals are different from the final enactment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jonathan, this is a process that has been used -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by the richness with which people can pivot to believing what they used four out of 10 times in a previous Congress to pass things now have great objections to using so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you guys wanted to hold yourselves to a higher standard.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fact is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not holding -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not changing the standard we\xe2\x80\x99re holding ourselves to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pointing out the, quite honestly, low standards with which many of the people that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me about have been quoted as saying.\xc2\xa0 When Republicans use these types of rules four out of 10 times in a previous Congress and then vociferously object to the use of that rule now, I think that is -- I think that is -- again, the standard is to embrace something and then find it objectionable a pivot that requires something few figure skaters in the Olympics are able to pull off.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this the first -- is this the most significant social policy legislation to pass in 30 years, or is this just another run-of-the-mill bill going through a process like that has been used --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a quantitatively different argument I would assume you\xe2\x80\x99re making now, right?\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\'t have it both ways.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s the same --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- no, but neither can -- Jonathan, but neither can somebody else have the argument.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s not whether that is used; you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the use is based on the scope -- is that right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t any more have to do with the use of the rule.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve now switched the argument to be the rule can only not be used if the scope exceeds some arbitrary barrier, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not whether I would agree with it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you whether your agreement to the previous scenario extends to the latter scenario.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, if you look at the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You can think about that and we can -- yes, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Schumer and the China currency stuff, Schumer and Graham said today it helps to put pressure on the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys agree that this congressional pressure helps go towards the goal the President has been very clear about, which is to have a more market-oriented appreciation of the yuan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, not having evaluated the legislation or their proposal -- again, I think the President has been clear recently, the President was clear with the Chinese in Beijing, about a market-oriented approach to their currency.\xc2\xa0 So I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into the specifics of the legislation, just the language, the body language from Capitol Hill, is that helpful?\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that helps with leverage with the Chinese?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the most leverage that the President has is sitting face to face with leaders in Beijing and telling them that a market-oriented approach to their currency -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s about as much leverage as one can bring to bear in a single sitting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would you prefer that some of the rhetoric gets toned down from Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass judgment on their proposal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric Cantor called Rahm Emanuel a couple of days ago, asked him to tone down the rhetoric --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it was yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- against Israel.\xc2\xa0 He said when you scold Israel, basically you take some of the pressure off the Palestinians to do their own negotiating.\xc2\xa0 Do you disagree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said earlier today and as I said last week when asked about this, there are actions that each side takes that hurt the trust needed to bring these two sides together.\xc2\xa0 The State Department reiterated -- or I will reiterate what the State Department said yesterday about the deep concern that we have around inflammatory rhetoric around the rededication of a synagogue in Jerusalem.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful on that side of the ledger.</p>\n<p>Again, Prime Minister Netanyahu has apologized and found regrettable the timing of the decision that was announced during the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think what is important to understand -- and I believe Congressman Cantor understands -- is that despite a disagreement that you might have, our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is unchanged.\xc2\xa0 Our commitment to its people is unchanged.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the Palestinians?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President reiterated that at the beginning of his trip.\xc2\xa0 That was the reason for his trip.\xc2\xa0 He reiterated that in a speech -- after the Prime Minister found cause for regret, the Vice President reiterated our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on health care, in order to get the Senate bill through the House, if there is a specific vote, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to change the minds of some of the 31 Democrats who voted against the House bill in November.\xc2\xa0 What gives you confidence that you can do that?\xc2\xa0 What gives you confidence, especially since there are a number of Democrats who voted in favor of the House bill who now say they can\xe2\x80\x99t support the Senate bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Health care.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, but based -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about somebody like a member who is more -- well, I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 Look, there are -- I think there are those that voted against the legislation for any number of reasons -- not believing that there was enough cost control in the legislation, or disagreeing with the mechanisms that were set up around choice and competition -- that they may find the Senate bill more to their liking in terms of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that -- again, I think the case that the President will make -- I also think the case -- one of the strong cases the President will make, as we get to the end of this debate, I do think it becomes far more crystallized in people\xe2\x80\x99s minds that this is the last chance to do something.\xc2\xa0 And what does our health care system look like if we do nothing?\xc2\xa0 We know.\xc2\xa0 Letters come with skyrocketing rate increases on the individual market.\xc2\xa0 Families will see over the course of the next several years average premiums for a family go from $13,000 to $24,000.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens if we walk away.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, in many ways, is having a positive effect on the idea of doing something now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the case the President made to Dennis Kucinich?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably part of the case that he made to him.\xc2\xa0 And then he was helped by somebody in the crowd that the President asked that person to repeat so the congressman could hear.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, by your way of thinking, by the end of the week, Friday or Saturday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a vote and either health care will have passed or it will have failed.\xc2\xa0 Is the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- just, by the way, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go way out on a limb here, but I moderately believe most in the room would agree with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So given that, is the President prepared then for his voice to be largely absent in the week following that as the reverberations from whatever happens on -- one way or the other, that he will be halfway around the world?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You all will be asking him, ad nauseum, about Indonesia and Australia and democracy over here and exports and\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s more --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly, all the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got my questions written --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I -- we better get a much better Indonesia briefing for the President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell us about the yuan --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, he is prepared to be there during that week, whichever way it happens?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Michael, more seriously, that when the President -- as I said last week, when the President talked to the Speaker and the Majority Leader, while there was an agreement to give both sides a few extra days of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time to help passage, the President was also\xc2\xa0 -- the President and the leaders agreed also of the importance of this trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I went through some of that reasoning last week.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia is critical to -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re critical to Indonesia -- in helping on counterterrorism and, ultimately, in protecting our country; the type of trading relationships that we have with these two countries, and that we hope to expand with these two countries; help grow our economy.\xc2\xa0 So it is -- it is an important trip that the President will take and I think he looks forward to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there people that you all are leaving behind that you would normally -- who would normally take that trip, but are staying here to deal with that week?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any plans for the trip to make adjustments to allow --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope the schedulers aren\xe2\x80\x99t watching.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Your scenario might have caused some heart palpitations in a certain few rooms.\xc2\xa0 No, look, I -- the Vice President will be -- obviously be here as this next goes to the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I think, obviously, the President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s enormously important.\xc2\xa0 I do believe that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, honestly, whether some of the staff that will stay would necessarily have gone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of them?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rahm?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Chief of Staff will be here and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the Chief of Staff had plans -- in fact, certainly under the previous trip schedule, he was not planning on going for a whole host of commitments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things, Robert.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Sunshine Week and the President has --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I noticed the beautiful weather.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The beautiful sunshine outside and the President has --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Coordinated by Ben LaBolt in order to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- has praised his administration for openness.\xc2\xa0 So in that spirit, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you will release in real time a list of the people that the President is talking to about health care this week.\xc2\xa0 Can we have the names?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President will meet with undecided members of the House, meet with senators --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a no?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- looking to make the strongest case possible for health care reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up -- I\xe2\x80\x99m taking that as a no, you won\xe2\x80\x99t -- you won\xe2\x80\x99t be giving us the names of the people that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to sit in on some of your assignment meetings just as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you would like to be the pool reporter for some of the Oval Office --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you usually know what I\xe2\x80\x99m working on, so why can\xe2\x80\x99t it be in return?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I\'m mean, why not?\xc2\xa0 Why not tell us who he is reaching out to?\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about opening the process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve read many of your stories and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed down many of the people that the President is likely to see this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as a follow on that, I understand he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be on FOX News, talking about health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And the administration\xe2\x80\x99s tussles with FOX News are well known, so can you talk to us a little bit about why he\xe2\x80\x99s going on FOX now and what he thinks he can accomplish by reaching out to their audience in particular?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously they have a pretty big audience share and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that a lot of members that are undecided are going to be -- they watch and their constituents watch this news.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to continue the argument on why health care reform is important to pass this year on FOX.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he really think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to change the minds of FOX viewers, many of whom I suspect are opposed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly worth a shot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You partially answered this, but Israel claims over the years it\xe2\x80\x99s tried to protect holy sites -- Christian, Muslim and Jewish holy sites.\xc2\xa0 Have you ever discussed this with the Palestinians and asked them to refrain from attacks on either people\xe2\x80\x99s holy sites?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have -- I would say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m taking this a little bit broader -- I would say the types of things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us and, quite frankly, administrations in the past discuss as unhelpful to moving this process along are -- is any call for the incitement of violence.\xc2\xa0 Again, I mentioned the State Department -- reiterated the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s guidance on what we believed was unhelpful rhetoric around the rededication of a synagogue in Jerusalem as a real-time example of the type of action and rhetoric that is not in any way productive and undermines the trust that\xe2\x80\x99s needed for both of these sides to sit down and directly address their issues and move forward on peace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To be precise on health care, when you talk about an up or down vote this week, you are talking about the Senate bill passing the House, or being passed in some way by the House.\xc2\xa0 Would the President then sign that?\xc2\xa0 How quickly could he sign it?\xc2\xa0 And would he wait for secondary -- the fixed legislation to come along?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I understand this, that\'s a decision that will largely -- that will be governed largely by a decision by the parliamentarian to -- that might require that signature prior to the taking up of reconciliation -- if that\'s, as I understand it, that\'s what the President would do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say this, and I said this over the weekend, that the President has and is spending time talking with senators, understanding that, again, this is a two-step process; that they have a very important role to play, and the President has and is continuing to work with the Senate on their part of this, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Senate language as it was passed last December, would he be able to sign that right away?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate language, if it goes to the House, would he be able to sign that right away, like before he\xe2\x80\x99s wheels up on Sunday morning?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- this is a better question for the House.\xc2\xa0 The President would make himself available to do that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he was told he needed to by the parliamentarian, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Otherwise he would wait for the reconciliation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- this is -- I don\'t want to get into hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 Again, the answer I outlined -- let me -- I think I can break this up and answer your question.\xc2\xa0 The procedure outlined, as I understand what the parliamentarian has either -- has decided or is likely to decide -- what I was saying a minute ago on the second part, pushing back, is I assume that bill can be gotten down here quickly, though.\xc2\xa0 It will take some time to enroll and what have you.\xc2\xa0 But if the President -- if that process requires that the President sign that bill, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to do so prior to leaving.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he sign it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President -- and did the President offer --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say it again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it in this country, then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, a lot of this would depend first and foremost on the parliamentary decision, and secondly, on the quickness with which a bill can be enrolled and moved down here. It\xe2\x80\x99s only Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of time to get it to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he offer Tim Kaine a job during lunch?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he offered him salt.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 He had -- I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I would say that he offered Governor Kaine a job a few years and he gladly accepted it, and he is doing a great job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I -- just one little housekeeping thing, then a subsequent question on health care.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to have another public event on health care this week?\xc2\xa0 And what might it be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me double-check with scheduling.\xc2\xa0 I believe -- I believe he will -- I believe he is likely to have at least one more, if not more than one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In town, yes.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of assets overseas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- nobody would go and say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- we\xe2\x80\x99d love to fill up the bird and go somewhere.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not overseas, I meant --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 No, no, even outside, even in the continental United States, I think they would look at us like we were crazy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of your arguments about this deem and pass scenario, what you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of saying is this discussion is kind of silly, because everybody is going to look at their votes as either for or against the health care bill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s not only how they\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it, I think, quite honestly, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a silly exercise to pretend that you\xe2\x80\x99re not voting for the Senate bill and the Cornhusker Kickback when you vote for the rule?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just as when you vote for the reconciliation that corrects that, you will have done that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But so anybody who votes for the rule --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And since those, I think, in this bill will be simultaneous, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to you and your editors how you would work that out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except for the reconciliation part won\xe2\x80\x99t be finalized for quite --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the corrections -- some of the corrections\xc2\xa0 -- right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for quite a while -- quite many days after that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve proved my earlier point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Nancy Pelosi can\xe2\x80\x99t -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that she can\xe2\x80\x99t provide any cover for her members to act as if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for the Senate bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the process, Mara, again, as I mentioned to Ann, is a two-step process -- right?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote on legislation; they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote on a series of corrections.\xc2\xa0 The President will sign -- looks forward to signing all of that and reforming our health care system.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 If or when the legislation passes, if it comes under the sort of cloud of controversy -- very tight votes, criticism over the whatever -- at what cost is that going to be to the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to govern going forward, and to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 position heading into the midterms?\xc2\xa0 I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s a risk you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take that getting this done --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Flesh out for me just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this passes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s ugly, right -- if the health care overhaul becomes law but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bad feelings about it, and all your Republican friends are mad at you and -- don\'t feel good about it and all this sort of stuff, will it impair the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to govern going forward, and to what extent -- and the caveat being that from where you\xe2\x80\x99re coming from, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to have this than not to have this -- totally get it -- but if it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of not clean and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy at the end?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- taking this in two separate ways -- again, I think the President has made clear through his commitment the importance of getting this done.\xc2\xa0 That having been said, we will wake up next week, next month, several months from now with many critical and important issues.\xc2\xa0 Senator Dodd introduced financial reform yesterday to put in place strong rules governing the way our financial system should work that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t 18 months ago when we watched Wall Street collapse and the dreams of many in America collapse.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue that is going to be on the plates of legislators, regardless of the outcome of health care.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned in here over the past several days the Supreme Court case around Citizens United that the President has serious reservations about.\xc2\xa0 In financial reform, we have -- the President has outlined a fee on banks to pay taxpayers back completely for the money that they lent financial systems through the TARP program.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of health care, those problems still exist and they have to be addressed throughout the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>I think that those are important issues not just for Congress and the administration but I outline them as important issues for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that -- I don\'t think that they want that process to stop because of health care reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you look to build coalitions that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need both within the Congress and the goodwill of the American people on all these issues -- on financial reform, on cap and trade, looking maybe way down the road now -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is do you think that your ability to get the votes that you need on those things and to have the goodwill you need on those things will be somehow impaired because of sort of the political costs of getting this big, important bill through?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\'t -- I don\'t believe that\'s true. I don\'t think that\'s true either in Congress and I certainly don\'t believe that\'s true on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 Again, there are important problems that will exist.\xc2\xa0 There will be important solutions that the American people will want to see their Congress act on.\xc2\xa0 I cannot imagine that we want to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the collapse of our financial system because of reckless behavior by announcing that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have new rules of the road going forward.</p>\n<p>I don\'t -- and I think that elections -- I don\'t think anybody wants to go -- I said this last week -- I don\'t think people want to go home saying that those rules of the road haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed, and it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re back to the wild, wild west.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people, their constituents, are not going to accept that a disagreement that was had in March affects your ability to institute strong rules of the road on Wall Street in September.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, to sort of follow up on that, SEIU had a poll that was released yesterday that sort of talked about the bad taste people have in terms of some of these process issues -- the Cornhusker Kickback -- and said that was actually more dangerous to the Democrats in the midterms than what was actually in the bill.\xc2\xa0 And that comports with what we heard out of Massachusetts from voters who voted for Scott Brown.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a very real danger, if not for the White House, but for Democrats on the Hill, that the spinning of this, the deals -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten this torrent of press releases from Republicans in the last two days\xc2\xa0 -- kickbacks, deals, this kind of talk harms --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the one you mentioned specifically is the one the President specifically has taken out of the legislation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President would disagree that the process that ended late last year didn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the way people viewed the product at the beginning of this year. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has asked that that type of stuff be taken out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has engaged Republicans and Democrats alike in a process that puts the focus back on what the legislation does for the American people.\xc2\xa0 I do think that the rate increases by the insurance companies have had a galvanizing effect in letting people know what happens again if we walk away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this perception, though, that you were talking about last year into this year, is that informing these conversations you\xe2\x80\x99re having with undecided members?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if they\xe2\x80\x99re coming to you and asking for specific things, is the President now more likely to say, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to make those kinds of deals?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President is making the case based on the legislation.\xc2\xa0 And I think the process that the President has been engaged in over the past several months has in many ways been to clean up where that process went wrong at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a clarification on the FOX News thing -- he is going on with Bret Baier?\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be live?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Likely taped.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial reform, the President has met recently a few times I believe with Jamie Dimon.\xc2\xa0 Has he asked him, and other executives, to ease up on their opposition to having a consumer financial protection agency?\xc2\xa0 And also -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll do two at once here -- has Larry Summers and Tim Geithner been brought in to talk to their former Wall Street colleagues about their opposition to having such a bureau or agency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this.\xc2\xa0 The President used the occasion of them being here last year on small business lending to talk about not only the consumer financial protection agency but also overall financial reform.\xc2\xa0 We believe it is in the interest of the American people to set rules of the road to give -- to empower consumers with the information they need, and to do so in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t carve out certain lenders like payday lenders or things like that in protecting consumers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Larry and Tim have talked with anybody on Wall Street in the past 24 hours since Senator Dodd introduced his legislation.\xc2\xa0 I do know that the NEC and the Treasury Department were indeed working with, and have been working with, Senator Dodd over the past many weeks on the legislation that he introduced yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you do know there\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous lobbying effort on the part of banks and other Wall Street firms targeting this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President continue to sort of try to beat that back?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, I think you saw in his statement, is committed to a strong consumer agency.\xc2\xa0 He will seek opportunities as it relates to the overall bill to strengthen it, and will fight, as he said yesterday, any effort to weaken the legislation that he believes, again, provides very clear,\xc2\xa0 common-sense rules of the road so that the American people are never on the hook for the excesses of Wall Street banks.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, talk -- I want to ask you a question about tradeoffs for the health care reform bill.\xc2\xa0 HBCU has been saying that they got word from Hill leaders last week that funding -- $2 billion worth of funding for HBCUs over 10 years -- was on the chopping block, and it was put back in yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern that this President put all this money in, had this big ceremony to help fund HBCUs -- Historically Black Colleges and Universities -- and the money was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I know what -- Tuskegee being here --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Morgan State, we had Hampton -- okay, anyway -- Howard -- but going back -- going back to the issue, they are concerned that if it was able to linger and be on the chopping block once, what\xe2\x80\x99s to say it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen in the next few days before a vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I get where you\xe2\x80\x99re going.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m lost on the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m lost on the -- you said why it was on the chopping block, why it was added back in, and why it would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Hill leaders were saying that they had to shave some money for reconciliation, and that was one of the areas that they tried to shave -- HBCU money, that the President is definitely -- he said he was standing by, and he even reiterated that to the CBC.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get DPC to look into -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough on the HCBU process on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this President -- but does this President stand by HBCUs and the funding that he put in --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and would he stand up to these lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me -- I want to get -- obviously the President is supportive of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\xc2\xa0 Around the specific instance that you mentioned, let me get some guidance from DPC.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, perhaps a sore point, but Congressman Darrell Issa has accused you, Robert Gibbs, of being part of a cover-up because you will not say whether the White House offered Joe Sestak a job for not running against Arlen Specter.\xc2\xa0 Guilty or not guilty?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to several people in the White House; I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to people that have talked to others in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told that whatever conversations have been had are not problematic.\xc2\xa0 I think Congressman Sestak has discussed that this is -- whatever happened is in the past, and he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on his primary election.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office look into whether this was a crime --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my previous lines.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sestak says he was offered something.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to what I just said a minute ago.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for anyone from your administration to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu next week while he\xe2\x80\x99s in town for AIPAC?\xc2\xa0 The President is away but the Vice President might be around.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are obviously away while they\xe2\x80\x99re here. I will check with NSC and see whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Vice President or whether others in the administration --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the relationship with the Turkish administration, Turkey recalled its ambassador two weeks ago because of the genocide resolution passed, and Turkish Prime Minister said last week that unless they see some steps taken by the U.S. administration, Turkey is not going to send its ambassador.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, absence of the Turkish ambassador in Washington, is it a matter of concern for the U.S. administration?\xc2\xa0 And second, are there any steps being taken by the U.S. administration to assure Turkish administration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- on the second part, let me check with the NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we believe that Turkey is a valuable partner.\xc2\xa0 The President traveled there on one of his first trips abroad to demonstrate the importance of that partnership; on that trip, worked on a process that has now resulted in -- or resulted in the announcement of more normalized relations, pending parliament passes a protocol, and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly hopeful that that will happen.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:37 P.M.
