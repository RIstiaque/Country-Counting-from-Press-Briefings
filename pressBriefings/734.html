Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:25 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back from what I hope was a fabulous weekend.\xc2\xa0 And I have no announcements to make at the top.\xc2\xa0 I think you probably saw, if you did not attend, the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that he made his nomination for Secretary of the Treasury.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I got nothing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Secretary of Labor.\xc2\xa0 There is a Secretary of the Treasury.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still Sunday.</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. take on this EU plan with Cyprus that would basically call on Cyprus\xe2\x80\x99s government to raid the personal accounts of its citizens?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously monitoring the situation right now. Our general proposition is that we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s very important for Europe to take steps necessary, as they have been, to both grow and deal with sovereign debt issues.\xc2\xa0 But as regards this particular situation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Cyprus -- beyond saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring it -- I mean, refer you to Treasury beyond saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The markets, the global markets have obviously reacted negatively to this.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern, anything you would say to the American people about whether this might ricochet to the U.S. economy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on markets.\xc2\xa0 You might see if Treasury officials will comment on them.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we have long said that a strong, stable Europe is in the interest of the United States, and that applies broadly to our approach to all of Europe and to all of the eurozone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With regards to Cyprus, I would refer you to Treasury except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President had any reaction to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s announcement today that she publicly backs gay marriage now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President believes that any time a public official of stature steps forward to embrace a commitment that he shares to equality for LGBT Americans he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with him about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, but I know that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he feels in general when major figures in our society make their views known.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to how far this country and how quickly this country has traveled, as he has said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if she gave the White House any heads-up that she would be making this announcement today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that she did.\xc2\xa0 She is obviously a private citizen, and her views are in concert with the President\xe2\x80\x99s, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that she gave any heads-up.</p>\n<p>Reuters.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Mason.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Cyprus -- and without commenting specifically, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, about what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at there -- does the U.S. -- would the White House intellectually support the idea of taxing people\xe2\x80\x99s bank accounts for any reason?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, without commenting on Cyprus -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my roundabout way of trying to get you to just comment on the overall theme.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any more you can say about that particular piece?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is the wise course to defer to the Treasury Department and to note only that we are monitoring this closely, as you would imagine, but that our overall approach has been to support a strong, stable Europe because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest not just of Europe but in the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President, when he makes further travel later this year -- G8, G20-related trips -- do any specific stops in Europe to discuss not just Cyprus but the EU crisis in general?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no specific scheduling announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President of the United States participates generally in meetings like the G8 and G20.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly the case that international economic issues are top of the agenda also -- often in these meetings and will be again this year.</p>\n<p>The situation in Europe and the eurozone has been prominent in the discussions in the past several years that the President has had with his counterparts, and I imagine that will continue to be the case.\xc2\xa0 But as part of a broader discussion of global economic issues, the need for all economies to take steps to grow, even as they deal with their debt challenges -- as is the approach that this President takes, as you know, which is to ensure that we implement economic policies that ensure economic growth and job creation, expansion of the middle class even as we tackle our deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of balanced approach he supports here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict when these summits come around what will be absolutely top of the agenda, but that issue is certainly one that is frequently discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just one follow-up then on Tom Perez.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s already some criticism today from Republicans that Mr. Perez was particularly political in approaching -- in his approach to the law and in aggressively seeking to allow the hiring of illegal workers.\xc2\xa0 Are these concerns that you think may affect his ability to get Senate confirmation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that Tom Perez is enormously qualified for this position.\xc2\xa0 His record is substantial; his resume is full.\xc2\xa0 As you know, under Tom\xe2\x80\x99s leadership at the Justice Department, the Civil Rights Division has settled the three largest fair lending cases ever on behalf of families targeted by unfair mortgage lending practices.\xc2\xa0 The division has fought to protect the rights of every American student to achieve the quality education they will need to compete for the jobs of tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 It has dramatically increased the enforcement of human trafficking laws, and stepped up its efforts to ensure our nation\xe2\x80\x99s veterans do not lose their civilian job because they are serving our nation.</p>\n<p>Prior to serving in his current role, Tom was the Secretary of Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, which protects consumers and workers through the enforcement of a wide range of consumer rights, workplace safety, and wage and hour laws.\xc2\xa0 And his record is impressive.\xc2\xa0 His personal story is remarkable.\xc2\xa0 You wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99re one of five siblings and you\xe2\x80\x99re the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s not the doctor if you\xe2\x80\x99re the failure in the family, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s enormously talented and qualified for the position.</p>\n<p>Yes, Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I want to go at the Cyprus question again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good luck.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been a lot of positive signs about the trajectory of the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 And I guess, if you can be specific as to what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s concerns are that what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there in Cyprus could potentially stall what is happening here in the U.S.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said all along, through the last several years, that we need to address the issues that we can control, and we have done that repeatedly with the policy decisions that this President has made and has implemented.\xc2\xa0 And that has led to a period of sustained economic growth, although not, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, enough economic growth, which is why we have work to do.\xc2\xa0 It has led to three years of private sector job creation -- more than 6.3 million private sector jobs created, but not enough.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes we need to press on with a jobs and growth agenda that ensures that even as we deal with our deficit and debt challenges, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to grow the economy, and to do it in a way that enhances job creation, that strengthens the middle class, that protects seniors, that allows for investments in education, innovation, manufacturing, research and development that underpin our future economic development and growth.</p>\n<p>So we take that approach in part because it helps insulate the United States as much as possible in a global economy from the impacts of various events around the world.\xc2\xa0 But we do live in an international, global economy, which is why the President has engaged so regularly and consistently and aggressively with his counterparts around the world as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression -- a global economic crisis and financial crisis that affected nations around the world.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific comment on today\xe2\x80\x99s news, except to say that we have long said that a stable, strong Europe is in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to discuss with and coordinate with his counterparts to help in any way we can to help bring that about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, Republicans are going through quite a bit of retooling, trying to become more inclusive, pull in a different kind of demographic.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if -- any reaction at all from the President as there\xe2\x80\x99s this big move in reacting to what happened in the 2012 elections.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as the President has said, he believes that a strong, two-party system is important in our democracy.\xc2\xa0 It is also true, as he has noted and the Constitution requires, he will not be running again for office, so his view of this is a little different, probably, than it was a year ago or more.\xc2\xa0 But I would say, again -- this is not coming from the President, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the best way to increase support with the public for your party is to embrace policies the public supports.\xc2\xa0 And embracing policies the public does not support or aggressively rejects makes it more difficult to earn the public\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when it comes, again, to matters like how we grow our economy and, as we grow our economy, how we deal with our deficit and debt challenges, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted frequently, the public overwhelmingly supports a balanced approach to that challenge.\xc2\xa0 The public does not support -- did not support last year, did not support the year before -- an effort to deal with our deficit challenges by asking seniors to bear the burden through voucherized Medicare; asking families who have to deal with disabled children or parents in nursing homes to bear the burden all so that the wealthiest can enjoy a massive tax break -- a tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Tax Policy Center says the latest Republican budget out of the House would give a $5.7 trillion tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Even in today\xe2\x80\x99s numbers, that is a load of money, and somebody has got to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 And there is no way to do it by any tax analysis that\'s credible without sticking it to the middle class if you believe you can do it in a revenue-neutral way.\xc2\xa0 The middle class pays.\xc2\xa0 The wealthy and well-connected benefit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not economic policy that makes sense for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly doesn\'t make sense for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when can we expect the President to make his March Madness picks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you on that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will be, as so many sports fans will be, paying close attention when he can.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s about to head off on a foreign trip.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, catch the news when he can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot of time on the plane to work his brackets.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, going back to the question about Hillary Clinton and her endorsement of gay marriage, there seems to be continued support, growing support for this.\xc2\xa0 Republicans even today, as Dan mentioned, did, in fact, say they have to appeal more to gay voters.\xc2\xa0 What is it going to take -- why does the President not promote now -- why does now not promote federal legislation to make gay marriage legal nationwide instead of going state by state?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President addressed this, and I would refer you to his words, his views on this matter, his views on the decision to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case, his views about how that brief addressed the question the Court was asking, but that on the broader principle, in his view, as to whether or not a state could present a reason to discriminate against LGBT Americans that was constitutional, he could not imagine it.\xc2\xa0 But again, the brief filed responded to the case at hand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the President, but I would encourage you to look at his remarks on that matter.</p>\n<p>Yes, Mr. Rosen, welcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to be back, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two subjects, if I may.\xc2\xa0 First, on the Perez nomination, this nomination comes shortly after the issuance of a report by the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Inspector General, which touched on Assistant Attorney General Perez\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing the report, but faithfully.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It states that the investigators did not find that Mr. Perez misled them but that his testimony before them did not capture the essence of the matters under investigation, and that by the common understandings of the English language, he should have known better, in essence.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the thrust of the report.\xc2\xa0 Was this report a factor for the President in his decision to nominate Perez?\xc2\xa0 Did anyone read this report before nominating him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can be sure that in any nomination process, all the necessary background research is done.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that the criticism in the Inspector General report, as you noted, of the Civil Rights Division -- well, as you didn\xe2\x80\x99t note, but I will -- largely predated Tom Perez and even this administration. In fact, the report concluded that in the wake of the improper hiring practices that took place in the previous administration, Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez restored nonpartisan, merit-based hiring to the Civil Rights Division.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Inspector General concluded that voting rights enforcement decisions made by leadership were not due to improper racial or political considerations.\xc2\xa0 After a number of past incidents of harassment of voting section career staff based on perceived political affiliation, mostly occurring between 2004 and 2007, the Inspector General reported that Mr. Perez has taken a number of steps to foster a more collegial and professional workplace.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s from page 133 in the report.</p>\n<p>The Inspector General report found that the Civil Rights Division handled the new Black Panther case -- I\xe2\x80\x99m beating you to the punch here -- that they handled it properly.\xc2\xa0 The OPR \xe2\x80\x9cconducted an investigation of the new Black Panther party case, and issued a report dated March 17th, 2011, which found that the attorneys did not commit professional misconduct or exercise poor judgment, but rather acted appropriately in the exercise of their supervisory duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I could continue with the quotation.</p>\n<p>So the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you reading -- you were reading?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that amazing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m reading from a report, James.\xc2\xa0 And I think the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you address the part of the report that I brought up then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which is?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is that the investigators found that Perez did not intentionally mislead them but that by the plain understanding of the English language, he should have testified in a way that captured the essence of the matters under investigation and that he did not do so.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the operative sentence is the first part, which is Mr. Perez did not mislead, and that was the finding of the report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Different subject, if I may.\xc2\xa0 I checked for this in recent briefings and didn\xe2\x80\x99t find that it had been addressed, at least on camera.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House take a position on whether the various lawmakers who have been seeking access to the Benghazi survivors should, in fact, have that access?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said on your air the other day, the White House is certainly not preventing anybody from having access to any of the survivors of the Benghazi attack.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that government employees -- in this case, some of them in highly sensitive positions -- have responsibilities that existed before and exist after an attack like that.\xc2\xa0 But investigation is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Cooperation with and briefing of members of Congress continues in the investigation, as appropriate, and has been in keeping with the incredible amount of cooperation we have provided to Congress, and all of their inquiries with regard to the Benghazi matter.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what else to say about this.\xc2\xa0 I know that some general assertions had been made.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is it\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation and certainly nobody at the White House is preventing anybody from talking to anyone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question, if I may.\xc2\xa0 When I traveled with Secretary Kerry earlier this month, I had a chance to interview him overseas, and I asked him when we will hear from the Benghazi survivors.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry disclosed for the first time publicly that he, in fact, had gone to Walter Reed and met with one of the survivors himself.\xc2\xa0 To your knowledge, has President Obama made any effort to meet with or speak with any of the Benghazi survivors himself?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t talk specifics in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visits to Walter Reed.\xc2\xa0 I can --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or elsewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, according to a recent poll taken in Israel, 10 percent of Israelis view President Obama favorably.\xc2\xa0 What type of reception is he expecting?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s his message going to be to the people there to try to change that perception of him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will visit Israel with a message about the enduring relationship between the United States and Israel, about the unshakeable commitment the United States has to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security -- a commitment that is measured not just in the amount of assistance, but in the strong bonds that our people share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, I think I could point you to comments by Prime Minister Netanyahu, by Ehud Barak, and others who have offered their opinions about the fact that no previous administration has done so much for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security as this administration has.\xc2\xa0 And the President will certainly talk about that.</p>\n<p>He looks forward to speaking about the future of the relationship, especially with Israeli youth.\xc2\xa0 This is, as you know, just an incredible country that has this ancient history and yet a vibrant democracy and a vibrant economy, especially an economy that is innovative and filled with entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 And the President will certainly look to highlight that.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you he\xe2\x80\x99s very much looking forward to this trip.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to his meetings with Israeli leaders, as well as Palestinian leaders and the King of Jordan.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very important and worthwhile trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 According to some foreign policy experts with whom we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken, they\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the best that the President can hope for in this trip is to really convince the Israeli people that he stands with them, that he is on their side.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment?\xc2\xa0 And if not, what are his other expectations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that he, again, looks -- I think I would answer it the way I just did.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to this trip.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to engaging with Israeli leaders, as well as Israeli youth and other Israelis to talk about the U.S.-Israeli relationship, to talk about Israeli security and our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is when it comes to our relationship and this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the security of Israel, I would -- you don\'t have to take our word for it or his word for it.\xc2\xa0 I would point you, again, to statements made by prominent Israeli leaders about the nature of that commitment, which is as firm and strong as it has ever been.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one on immigration, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The RNC report also called for Republicans to embrace comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Does that, in any way, impact, move the efforts to get immigration reform passed forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that that does.\xc2\xa0 What moves it forward is what we continue to see as encouraging progress in the Senate with the so-called Group of Eight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important reminder that even as we deal with other challenges like our budget and deficit issues, that there is a broader agenda, an agenda that is shared not just by the President but others who believe we need to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We need to move forward on measures to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 We need to move forward on investments infrastructure and education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And those trains, if you will, keep moving in a positive direction.\xc2\xa0 And it is worth noting that there are signs of continued progress from Gang of Eight on comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President, as he has said in the past, believes that\'s very important and will continue to encourage that progress and look forward to the development of and passage of a bipartisan bill that he hopes he will be able to sign, because that\'s good for the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he identified a specific deadline by which he would like to see legislation proposed, and if not, that he will put forward --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have not identified a deadline.\xc2\xa0 The President has said that he sees no obstacle in moving quickly.\xc2\xa0 And he has encouraged the Congress to move quickly, the Senate in particular to move quickly. And there has been steady progress.\xc2\xa0 The tripwire, if you will, is more about whether or not that progress is seen to have slowed or stopped.\xc2\xa0 And that has not happened.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the opposite is true; it seems to be continuing.\xc2\xa0 And that is viewed here by the President and the rest of us as very positive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if the President\'s commitment to Israel is the unshakeable commitment of the U.S. to Israeli security and that\'s the message he wants to bring, why is he not speaking to the Knesset, as every other U.S. President recently has done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will be meeting with Israeli leaders and will be giving a speech that will be covered by all of the Israeli media to Israeli youth.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s entirely appropriate to the idea that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t he do both?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The notion that Israel\'s security is of concern only to members of the Knesset I think would be challenged by pretty much every Israeli over the age of five or six.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said why can\'t he do both?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re doing a lot.\xc2\xa0 The schedule is very packed, I can tell you, with meetings and events and a speech.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s going to be, we think, a trip that will reflect the President\'s commitment to Israel\'s security and to Israel\'s future, as well as his commitment to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, sure, but --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I\'m just telling you -- we chose, the President chose to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\'t the President speak to the Knesset?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re speaking to -- the President will speak to all of the Israeli people in front of an audience of young Israelis who have it within their hands the power to shape Israel\'s future.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks that\'s entirely appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And he will be meeting with Israeli leaders and government officials, of course.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s I think message will be heard by Israelis who are both members of the Knesset and who are not.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President heads in one direction, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- the other side of the world there are some very provocative actions and comments and statements being made by the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in contact with his allies, with his support system over there in Japan, et cetera -- in South Korea, as well as China, regarding the latest comments and the latest actions, including the rescinding of the Armistice during the 60th anniversary of that taking place?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President is very focused on this issue, and that his senior national security team is focused on this issue.\xc2\xa0 As you know, with U.S. leadership at the United Nations Security Council, a resolution sanctioning North Korea passed unanimously with Russian and Chinese support\xc2\xa0 -- a not insignificant occurrence.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is we remain committed to ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 And this means deterring North Korean aggression, protecting our allies, and the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state, nor will we stand by while it seeks to develop a nuclear-armed missile that can target the United States.\xc2\xa0 We obviously, as you know, made an announcement recently about developments in our missile defense program that reflects what we consider the increased threat from North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work with all of our allies and partners on this issue to pressure and isolate North Korea, to make clear to North Korea what its options are and how it needs to proceed in order to rejoin the community of nations.\xc2\xa0 And our position is quite firm on that.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nakamura, haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you in a while.\xc2\xa0 Welcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for having me back.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The door is always open.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Number one --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As long as you have your pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the -- bright red.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Two questions on immigration.\xc2\xa0 The Gang of Eight talks in the Senate on the immigration bill, I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a general sense that the senators are potentially looking to make changes to the way the family visas are allocated, maybe to put a little less emphasis on family connections and more of an emphasis on work skills.\xc2\xa0 Philosophically speaking, does the White House think that sort of a rebalancing of those priorities is necessary, is the right way to go?\xc2\xa0 I think right now, two-thirds of the visas given are for family reasons, and only 14 percent for employment reasons.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are saying we need to do more for the economy, this is a way to prioritize, because there is a huge backlog.\xc2\xa0 Is that the right way to go?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to judge the bill or the work of the Group of Eight before it has emerged.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just philosophically, I mean.\xc2\xa0 Is that the right way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, philosophically, the President thinks both are important.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to his blueprint for his views on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And it is obviously important to ensure that people from abroad who are coming -- young people from abroad who are coming and getting educated here with engineering degrees and the like, who have an interest in starting businesses or contributing to the American economy here, should be welcome to do that here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 But it is also obviously important that family relationships be honored, and I think that an approach that takes both into account is one the President would support.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to judge an outcome here when it\xe2\x80\x99s just in train, if you will, not -- it\'s not a completed effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other related question, or tangentially related.\xc2\xa0 The Chamber of Commerce came out last week and said that they were -- they felt that the negotiations with the AFL-CIO on immigration, as asked by the Senate and the White House to maybe come to an agreement on a guest worker program, had bogged down.\xc2\xa0 The Chamber says that they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for 400,000 new visas for guest workers, brand-new visas, and that the Chamber responded -- or that the AFL-CIO responded but with maybe a much lower figure of 10,000.\xc2\xa0 Forget figures for a second.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- is the President and the White House concerned about where those negotiations stand?\xc2\xa0 Do they think they can still come to an agreement?\xc2\xa0 And where do you all stand on a guest worker program that was not included, like, in your principles, and the President, as you know, in 2007, as a Senator, voted to sunset such a bill, or such a program?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we hope that the Senate will work on the issue of guest workers and we have noted the discussions that the Chamber and labor have had.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is -- I think in general we are seeing positive progress when it comes to the overall effort towards producing a comprehensive immigration reform bill, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there are issues and challenges that remain for those who are working it out.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge an outcome when we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House involved?\xc2\xa0 The Chamber seemed to indicate that it was mostly the Senate making the decision -- helping negotiate that and making decisions on their bill.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House involved with the Chamber and the AFL-CIO in a really active way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any role to elucidate here for the White House in that effort.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we believe that the Senate can address this.\xc2\xa0 Our broader principles have been laid out in the President\xe2\x80\x99s blueprint, and as you know, the President has prepared, if progress stalls in the Senate, to move forward with putting his own bill on the table.\xc2\xa0 His hope is that progress continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we believe, based on the evidence and the reporting of you and others, that that progress does continue, that there does seem to be at this stage real interest by both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate on finding a negotiated solution to this big challenge that could produce bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a very welcome development, and we hope that\'s where it heads.</p>\n<p>Sure, Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are not against a guest worker program?\xc2\xa0 You\'re for --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re for one?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I don\'t -- I mean, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past is that this is being worked on, and we hope it will be worked on in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It was not included in our blueprint, as others have noted in their questions, but we would look to the Senate and outside groups to work on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but just because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in your blueprint, that doesn\'t mean you\'re against it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And against a program that would be permanent, not sunsetted?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about things that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been decided.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to draw lines about what has to be in the bill.\xc2\xa0 What I would point you to is our blueprint.\xc2\xa0 And on this issue, I would point you to the work being done by the Senate and others on it.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Republicans have come out with a plan for outreach.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re spending $10 million for outreach, particularly for the black community.\xc2\xa0 Does the Democratic Party, particularly this White House, feel that it has to vie for the black vote?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I would say that as a principle that the President had when he was running for election is one that I think everybody who runs for office should have, which is that you have to make a case for your election with every voter.\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- that\'s sort of out my territory, but that\'s certainly reflecting the President\xe2\x80\x99s views from the past.\xc2\xa0 He himself obviously is not running again.</p>\n<p>For questions about the counterpart to the RNC, the DNC, what their view is, I would refer you to the DNC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with current issues, particularly as it comes to Cabinet posts that are up for the new nominations or appointments, is there concern in this White House from the community?\xc2\xa0 Have you been talking to the African American community about the lack of black appointments in this Cabinet for this second term so far?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to others, and you could direct your questions to others in the White House who do that kind of outreach.\xc2\xa0 I would only say what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, April, which is that this President is committed to diversity.\xc2\xa0 He believes that diversity is valuable because it enhances the decision-making process in the Cabinet, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important within his senior staff for the same reason.\xc2\xa0 And the President is obviously continuing to make personnel announcements, both for his Cabinet and other positions, as he did today, and that process is not finished yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you said the process is not finished -- are you leaving the door open to say there could be an African American appointed to a Cabinet post before it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply noting that posts that will be empty have not all been filled.</p>\n<p>Donovan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden in Italy this morning made some comments about the Mideast peace process, and he said that when the President goes to Israel, he will be delivering the message that the U.S. plans to be \xe2\x80\x9cvery engaged\xe2\x80\x9d in the peace process.\xc2\xa0 And I know you have said that really the focus is on the Palestinians and the Israelis sitting together and having direct one-on-one talks.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe a little bit what the White House really expects its role to be going forward in the process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously the United States has been -- under this President and previously -- an important player in the process that has sought as its end goal peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 And that is true in this administration.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s view and our policy is built around the notion that on the issues that divide them, Israelis and Palestinians need to have direct, face-to-face negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we have no role -- far from it -- but it does mean that neither we nor others can negotiate those issues on behalf of the Israelis and Palestinians, and hope to reach a solution.\xc2\xa0 The Israelis and Palestinians have to sit down together and have face-to-face negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it is why we have made so clear that with regards to either side, unilateral actions that make returning to direct negotiations more difficult are, in our view, unhealthy and unproductive to the process -- unhelpful and unproductive the process.\xc2\xa0 But certainly we have and will continue to be engaged in the Middle East peace process.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Syrian main opposition is meeting today in Istanbul, Turkey to form an interim government and select a Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a message to them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten anything specific.\xc2\xa0 With regards to that meeting, I can tell you that we support the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 We have recognized the Syrian Opposition Coalition.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work with our partners to provide both humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition.</p>\n<p>We believe strongly that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future will -- has to be without President Assad; that he has blood on his hands, and he is in no way to be a part of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future, as the Syrian people have decided.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen increasingly, albeit too slowly, signs of progress by the opposition and erosion of the regime\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is absolutely the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position that, working together with our partners on this issue, we will continue to support the opposition, support the Syrian people, pressure and isolate the Assad regime to help bring about the day that Syrians can chart their own future, a more democratic and prosperous future.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Voice of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Jay, there are two messages out of Israel today.\xc2\xa0 One was some remarks by Netanyahu seeming to hold out a hand to Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 The other one was a remark by the Housing Minister saying that they intend to go ahead with the current pace of settlement building.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that kind of -- is that a helpful thing to have on the eve of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that particular announcement, except what our general position is, is that unilateral actions that make it more difficult to engage -- to resume face-to-face negotiations, direct negotiations, are not things that we view favorably.\xc2\xa0 And that was true of unilateral efforts at the United Nations by the Palestinians, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been true of actions by the Israelis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is in our view and it\xe2\x80\x99s the position of the Israeli leadership that a two-state solution is the preferred goal here for both Israelis and Palestinians, and that all of us who are party to that process, but in particular the Israelis and Palestinians, ought to take steps that enhance the prospect of progress.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any specific reaction.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, have you heard anything about attempted hack of the Justice Department website?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any comment on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t neither heard of it and therefore I do not have comment on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question from Colorado.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From Colorado, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on this young woman\xe2\x80\x99s question about the high unemployment out in places like Colorado, all around the country, especially in the minority communities -- exceptionally high unemployment.\xc2\xa0 And when there is government workers who may be furloughed, millions of Americans unemployed, and family budgets that have been cut, how does the President justify lavish vacations and a golf trip to Florida at taxpayer expense?\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to cut back on his travel?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that this President is focused every day on policies that create economic growth and help advance job creation.\xc2\xa0 We have presided over the past three years over an economy that\xe2\x80\x99s produced over 6.3 million private sector jobs, and we have more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And this President\xe2\x80\x99s number-one priority is growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 When you come to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not working in the minority communities.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is unemployment has come down.\xc2\xa0 It has not come down nearly enough.\xc2\xa0 And what we need to do is embrace policies that advance job creation, make secure the middle class, and create ladders of opportunity for those who aspire to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We certainly do not need to embrace economic policies that shift the entire burden of deficit reduction onto senior citizens, middle-class families, Medicaid recipients.\xc2\xa0 The proposal coming out of the House would slash Medicaid by a third.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect inner-city jobs.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it does?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 People who depend on Medicaid to help take care of their kids who are disabled.\xc2\xa0 People who depend on Medicaid to take care of their parents who are in nursing homes.\xc2\xa0 People who are not in the middle class but aspire to it, who depend directly on Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 I think you need to examine what the Medicaid program actually does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you just respond to what Speaker Boehner said over the weekend on ABC News?\xc2\xa0 He was asked if revenues are still on the table, and he said the President got his tax hikes on the 1st of January; there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any more talk about revenues.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing that, too, but also again faithfully.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 No, no, you are.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And this will be -- I should go.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys go.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some positive comments from Republican lawmakers, especially in the Senate, about the idea that they could go along with a balanced approach to deficit reduction -- a balanced approach that the President has embraced, that Democrats in the Senate have put forward, that bipartisan commissions have suggested is the right way to go, and which the American people overwhelmingly support.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been some interesting reporting about Republican views on the budget in the House and how a number of them, including Chairman Ryan and John Boehner said last year, that the people will decide in the election in the fall which course we ought to take, whether it ought to be the House Republican approach to the economy and budgets and deficits, or the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery what the results of that election were.</p>\n<p>But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing:\xc2\xa0 The President believes there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation when it comes to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It is wholly unacceptable, not just to him but to the vast majority of the American people, to say that the well-off and well-connected should not have to do any more, that only senior citizens, middle-class families, people trying to send their kids to college, people trying to take care of parents in nursing homes, they bear the burden.\xc2\xa0 And you know what?\xc2\xa0 In addition to bearing the burden, they\'re going to pay for more tax cuts for the well-off and well-connected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But didn\'t he get his tax cuts on the 1st of January?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a proposal that includes revenue that was far exceeded, obviously -- or exceeded the roughly $600 billion that came with the rate increase for those making $400,000 or $450,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 Now, that may affect some folks, especially in the front row, but it does not affect the vast majority of the American people who had their tax cuts extended permanently.</p>\n<p>It is absolutely the case that the President believes what John Boehner said last December.\xc2\xa0 There are ample loopholes that we could close that benefit the wealthy and well-connected.\xc2\xa0 There are substantial tax provisions, special provisions for those who have lobbyists, that we can limit or eliminate, and that by doing so that we can produce revenue that helps reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 It is an entirely conservative position that we should close the loopholes that John Boehner says we should close; we should cap the deductions that John Boehner supposedly says we should cap, although we never see specifics; and use that revenue towards deficit reduction as opposed to tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s a very conservative position.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s embrace a balanced approach that includes entitlement reform and savings from it, tax reform and savings from it -- put it together, reduce our deficit, hit or exceed that $4-trillion target, and do the right thing by not just the economy in a macro sense, but for individual middle-class families across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s belief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the charm offensive over?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to engage with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Look, you cited John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 I think others have cited Senator Corker.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is there are Republicans who go along with the notion supported by the vast majority of the American people, including a majority of self-identified Republicans, that we can move forward on deficit reduction in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And that includes tough choices for Republicans as well as tough choices for Democrats.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
