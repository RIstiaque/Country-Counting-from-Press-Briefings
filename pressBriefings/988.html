Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:44 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Hope you\'re enjoying the spectacular weather.\xc2\xa0 It\'s supposed to get even warmer this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I take questions I wanted to remind you that later today the President will participate in an interview with YouTube and Google+ to discuss his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 The interview will be held through a Google+ hangout, making it the first completely virtual interview from the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President will answer questions submitted by and voted on by citizens from across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough the White House YouTube channel, nearly 228,000 people submitted more than 133,000 questions and cast over 1.6 million votes leading up to this interview with the President.\xc2\xa0 President Obama will answer a selection of the top-voted questions submitted through YouTube and engage with Americans in locations across the country, virtually, in the Google+ hangout.</p>\n<p>\n\tContinuing the administration\'s commitment to public engagement and participation, the White House launched an official presence on Google+ this month -- earlier this month.\xc2\xa0 The White House Google+ page delivers news, engagement opportunities and behind-the-scenes content to its followers.\xc2\xa0 President Obama\'s interview kicks off a series of White House hangouts in which members of the Obama administration will continue to use this platform to engage with citizens on a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 Video of the Google+ hangout will be streamed on WhiteHouse.gov and to the Briefing Room at 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain exactly what Google+ is?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Google+ is Google\'s social media vehicle.\xc2\xa0 But for more questions I refer you to the good folks at Google.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re right to ask.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There are some reports out of Cairo that the U.S. embassy there is giving shelter to Americans to prevent them from arrest.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House taking any steps to secure and protect their freedom?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can confirm that there are a handful of American citizens at the embassy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not aware that they\'re in any danger, but that handful of citizens has opted to stay in the embassy compound in Cairo while waiting for permission to depart Egypt.\xc2\xa0 As you know, these are citizens who have been told they cannot leave Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have, in our discussions with the staff of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, we\'ve made clear our concerns about this issue and our disappointment that these several citizens are not being allowed to depart Egypt, in connection with the government\'s investigation into NGOs.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work with the Egyptian authorities to resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said a "handful," and also "several."\xc2\xa0 Do you know how many we\'re talking?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more specific for you than that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a precise number to give you or any individual names.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To my question you said they\'re not in danger.\xc2\xa0 But they are in danger of arrest, are they not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what they are in -- what the issue is, as I understand it, is that the Egyptian authorities have said they cannot leave the country.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that there is an issue of arrest, although I would refer you to the State Department for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President, more broadly, growing frustrated with the pace of change in Egypt, particularly in the military council\'s hold on power there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is important to step back and noted -- and note, rather, that Egypt has achieved several historic milestones in its transition to democracy in recent days, including the first seating of democratically elected representatives of the People\'s Assembly since the revolution, the transfer of legislative authority to those representatives by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and the SCAF\'s announcement that it was taking steps to lift the state of emergency that has existed in Egypt for several decades.\xc2\xa0 There was also the peaceful commemoration of the revolution that made these steps possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we congratulate the Egyptians on these important steps toward fulfilling the promise of Egypt\'s revolution, which, as we all remember, inspired the world.\xc2\xa0 There are challenges that remain, but it\'s important to remember that Egypt has come a very long way.\xc2\xa0 As regards the issue that you talked -- that you started this round of questions with, we are concerned about it and we are in discussions with Egyptian authorities about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic, on a domestic matter.\xc2\xa0 I know sometimes you comment about the happenings on the Republican campaign trail, sometimes not.\xc2\xa0 This was one comment over the weekend -- I was wondering if you had a reaction to the chairman of the RNC comparing President Obama to the Italian ship captain who abandoned his passengers in that tragedy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because that was obviously -- well, let me just say that if you are so desperate for attention that you make an analogy that Michael Steele deems inappropriate, you know you\'ve probably gone too far.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russia\'s foreign ministry says Syrian President Assad\'s government has expressed a willingness to participate in Moscow-mediated talks to resolve Syria\'s crisis.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the U.S. position on these talks?\xc2\xa0 Would they have any -- would there be any concern that this would just further delay the process of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s exit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have details at this point on that meeting but, in general, we support efforts to reach a political solution that stops the violence in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are intensely discussing with the Russians the real deterioration on the ground in Syria and the very disturbing rise in violence there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re discussing with the Russians and other partners how best to use all the levers at the command of the international community and the United Nations to press the Syrian government to stop its appalling and ultimately ineffective and harmful repression.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re working with all our partners, and we believe that the Security Council -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the Security Council take action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. fully back the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s initiative that\xe2\x80\x99s been brought to the Security Council?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Security Council should not permit the Assad regime to assault the Syrian people while it rejects the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a political solution.\xc2\xa0 We do support the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s role in this process.\xc2\xa0 And governments that act to prop up Assad\xe2\x80\x99s brutal regime will find themselves in a small minority and criticized for abetting further human rights violations.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at where this process is headed.\xc2\xa0 Assad\xe2\x80\x99s fall is inevitable.\xc2\xa0 And so as governments make decisions about where they stand on this issue and what further steps need to be taken with regards to the brutality of the Assad regime, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to calculate into your considerations the fact that he will go.\xc2\xa0 The regime has lost control of the country and will eventually fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if Assad\xe2\x80\x99s fall is inevitable, as you say, is the U.S. involved in or aware of any international efforts to arrange his going into exile?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that -- none that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we support the Syrian people in their transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with our international partners to continue to pressure the Assad regime to get it to stop its brutal and appalling behavior, and to step aside so that that transition to democracy and a peaceful transition can take place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President this weekend in his weekly address talked about the nominations process and said that a senator was going to hold all nominations unless he fired Richard Cordray.\xc2\xa0 Is this just a complete breakdown of the system?\xc2\xa0 And does that mean more recess appointments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the first part of your question.\xc2\xa0 It is an example of how the system has broken down. That out of pique, a single senator can hold up all nominations is highly unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President mentioned it in his weekly address.\xc2\xa0 It is not how the system should work.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, to hold up the process and claim that no nominations will be cleared until the President removes the consumer watchdog that is so vital to the implementation of the Wall Street reforms that were put into place to prevent the kind of disastrous financial crisis that caused the greatest recession since the Great Depression is shocking in and of itself.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not a position that would be broadly supported by the American people; may not even be a position broadly supported by the constituents of the senator in question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s just the wrong approach, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that is conducive to getting the work that the American people want done, done here in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report today that Freddie Mac has securitized large sections of its mortgage holdings to earn interest, at the expense of homeowners who could refinance because if they did so, Freddie Mac would lose money on their investment portfolio.\xc2\xa0 Does this constitute a conflict of interest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we saw those reports and they certainly raise some concerns.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is an independent institution with independent governance, so we don\'t make those kinds of decisions.\xc2\xa0 But I believe Treasury is looking into it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would seem that it flies in the face of the President\xe2\x80\x99s request to make homeowner refinancing more easy and more affordable.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not an expert in this, but I don\'t know that it flies in the face of that at all.\xc2\xa0 I think it is a judgment worth looking at -- again, by an independent agency.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s commitment to making refinancing more available is absolutely firm and is not changed by anything that this independent agency is doing with regard to that.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ll hear more details about that from the President later this week about the refinancing initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 How much of a drag will the continued debt problems in Greece have on the U.S. economic recovery?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said, and it continues to be the case, that Europe remains a concern.\xc2\xa0 The Europeans have taken important steps towards dealing with their financial issues -- financial and markets issues.\xc2\xa0 There have been positive developments, but more work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And this is a European issue and the Europeans have the capacity and the wherewithal to resolve it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have been very engaged, both at the level of the President and, in particular, at the level of the Secretary of the Treasury, in an advisory capacity because we have some experience dealing with this kind of financial crisis and mitigating and resolving it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact that in a global economy a problem in Europe could affect our economy only reminds us and reinforces the fact that we need to take every measure we can on the issues that we control, to ensure that our economy keeps growing and it keeps creating jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why the President put forward the American Jobs Act in the fall.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he looks forward to the Congress extending without drama or delay the payroll tax cut to 160 million Americans, as well as unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why he will continue to press on the initiatives contained within his State of the Union address that are aimed at economic growth in the manufacturing sector and in innovation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause there -- because it is a world filled with potential problems to our global economy that may or may not transpire, you need to, here in Washington, do everything you can -- as an elected member of Congress and as President of the United States -- to create some insurance for our economy, that it continue to grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this President is committed to doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you say that the President has been involved in an advisory role, has he been making phone calls?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what specifically has he been doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any recent phone calls to read out to you, but as you know, for the past many months the President has been engaging with his European counterparts on this issue via telephone, as well as in meetings at the G20, for example.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Geithner has as well, with his counterparts, and he\'s traveled to Europe as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while it is a European issue that requires a European solution, we have important experience that we can bring to bear in advising -- offering our advice and counsel to the Europeans in how they deal with this.\xc2\xa0 And we urge the Europeans to continue to take the important measures necessary to stabilize the situation, to build the firewall necessary to ensure that this is resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the State of the Union, the President said -- talking about the importance of keeping young people in school -- said, "So tonight I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18."\xc2\xa0 Can you flesh that out a little bit more? What specifically is the President going to do to push this proposal, I guess, forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details for you on the proposal.\xc2\xa0 The principle itself I think the President believes is very important, that in today\'s economy, it is vitally important that states take action to ensure that Americans stay in school, that they get the education they need\xc2\xa0 -- the minimum education they need to be competitive in the workplace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President\'s commitment to education as a cornerstone to our economic growth I think has been clear now for three years, and his approach has been to reform in a way that has enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an area where there has been a significant amount of bipartisan support, and he continues -- he looks forward to continuing to work with members of Congress and other stakeholders around the country to push education reform forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause it really is -- it really is about our economic future.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that we have the most skilled workforce, the most educated workforce because that\'s our competitive advantage with other countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, are we going to get any details -- is the public going to get any details about the so-called Buffett Rule before the budget?\xc2\xa0 Or is it going to be in the budget?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate more details from us prior to the budget.\xc2\xa0 The Buffett Rule, as you know, as the President described it in the State of the Union, and certainly as Mr. Buffett has described it, is a principle that will guide the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to tax reform, and that principle is simply that it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- in an environment like the one we live in, where we have important investments that we need to pay for, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s national security or investments in education and innovation, everyone needs to pay their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to have a tax code that because of loopholes and other things within it where you have a millionaire or a billionaire paying a lower effective tax rate than some sizeable number of middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to get details?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you will get more details, but not prior to the budget.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The budget will be scored by CBO?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden over the weekend attended a retreat in which -- a Democratic House retreat in which he shared some details, in his inimitable style, about the decision-making process in the OBL raid, in which he said that he actually recommended against it, and everybody else in the room, with the exception of Secretary Panetta, hedged their bets.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Vice President Biden was one of the handful of people involved in this process, and I certainly -- I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking accurately.\xc2\xa0 I think the broader point, as the President has made here, is that this was not a sure thing, but the President had so much faith in our special forces and their capacity to fulfill this mission, that he made the call to go forward.\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Gates has spoken about this as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s a presidential-level decision, because in the end, as with a lot of decisions, your advisors come together and have compelling arguments on either side, and you have to make the call.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President did in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roger and then Wendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Along the lines of budgets, Mr. Furman, last week in a conference call, mentioned corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 Will that be part of the budget, too?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you will see more details about corporate tax reform around the period of the release of the budget, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you say \xe2\x80\x9caround the period,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning budget date, February 13?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I mean around that date.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pin it to a specific date.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, another subject.\xc2\xa0 Three Republicans in the Senate are introducing legislation to give Congress the authority to approve Keystone.\xc2\xa0 Will the White House -- will the administration weigh in, in opposition to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an opinion on a possible piece of legislation that may or may not come to pass.\xc2\xa0 I think we need to remember when -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important for you to remember and everyone to remember in looking at this issue how we got here.\xc2\xa0 A process was in place, consistent with precedent, where the State Department was reviewing the request for a permit here.\xc2\xa0 When significant concerns were raised about the pipeline route, not least by the Republican governor of Nebraska, a decision was made to seek an alternate route -- one that did not run through territory over the aquifer there in Nebraska.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe State Department made that decision; the President concurred on that decision.\xc2\xa0 It required an expansion of the time period to review the request, as would be appropriate because it was an alternate route -- an alternate route that, as far as I know, still has yet to be identified.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans, with absolutely clear warning from the State Department that doing so would put them in an untenable position, chose instead for political partisan reasons to insert this extraneous measure in the payroll tax cut extension, thereby all but ensuring that the State Department would recommend denying the permit because it could not grant a permit on a pipeline route that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even been identified.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s why we are where we are.\xc2\xa0 And whatever actions are taken in the Congress with regards to this, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have that as a backdrop when you\xe2\x80\x99re writing about it or discussing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s only a bill introduction and, as you say correctly, it\xe2\x80\x99s got a long way to go.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the White House would try to head it off, with a sense that momentum --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to predict.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing, on the meeting with Saakashvili this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be asking Georgia to contribute more troops in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 And also, what does the meeting -- what kind of impact may it have on U.S.-Russia relations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that the President looks forward to the meeting with Georgian President Saakashvili today in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 This year marks the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Republic of Georgia.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday the two Presidents will discuss further strengthening the U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership by enhancing our cooperation in the fields of trade, tourism, energy, science, education, culture, and security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama will underscore the importance of our defense cooperation with Georgia, including Georgia\'s substantial contributions to international security operations in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President will reconfirm U.S. support for the integrity of Georgia\'s territory within its internationally recognized borders.\xc2\xa0 The President also looks forward to discussing upcoming elections in Georgia and the reforms that will ensure Georgia\'s continuing transformation into a vibrant and stable democratic state.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow\'s that for an answer?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I get all that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to -- (laughter) -- well, let\'s wait for the meeting to happen, and if we have a readout to provide, we will provide it to you.\xc2\xa0 I think that our approach to Georgia and Georgia\'s relations with Russia has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And this meeting is -- the President looks forward to it, for all the reasons I just described.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Recognizing that the upcoming budget will have elements of restraining spending and also try to preserve the economic recovery, which direction will it tilt toward?\xc2\xa0 More spending to make sure the recovery doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go south, or really getting a handle on the debt?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, as you know because you reported on it, the spending has already been decided through the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 The overall amount that will be put forward in the budget was decided in August in a bipartisan vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s important, since you asked, to remind everyone that when it comes to deficit reduction and dealing with our long-term debt, this President, working with Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, has already locked in over $2 trillion in deficit reduction through spending cuts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore needs to be done, and you can be sure that the proposal the President put forward last fall for a comprehensive balance to deficit and reduction will be reflected in his budget, because it\'s the right way to go, as every independent bipartisan commission has said and which this President firmly believes.\xc2\xa0 And that balanced approach has to include revenues as well as entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 The President has been committed to that approach from the beginning and he remains committed to it, and you\'ll see that reflected in the budget.\xc2\xa0 Spending was decided with Republicans late last summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iran, Secretary Panetta says that it\'s possible they could have a nuclear weapon within a year should they decide to try and do that.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman says at some point the U.S. is going to have to decide whether to act militarily to prevent that.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that since the President has already said all options are on the table, he\'s going to have to make that decision within a year whether or not to use military force to deal with Iran\'s nuclear program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear two things:\xc2\xa0 one, that he is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 That is our policy.\xc2\xa0 He has also said that he takes no options off the table.\xc2\xa0 The strategy that he has been pursuing, with broad international support, has resulted in the most onerous sanctions ever placed on Iran that have had clear effect on the Iranian economy and on the Iranian regime, that have isolated Iran more than it has ever been.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue the pressure, using all the means at our disposal, working with the international community, to pressure Iran into living up to its international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does the President agree with that timetable, though, that he\'s going to have to make a decision in a year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s Wendell\'s words about when he has to make a decision.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary also went on to talk about delivery vehicles and the timeline for that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to get into --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did suggest that it would take longer --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- analyzing timetables.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that this President\'s policy is clear.\xc2\xa0 He has stated repeatedly that he and this administration are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We have a comprehensive strategy that we\'ve been executing with the international community and partners and allies around the world that is having a clear impact on the Iranian economy, and we continue to make clear to the Iranians that the way to relieve the pressure is to -- through the P5-plus-1 process, live up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 That is the right approach.\xc2\xa0 It is also the right approach to leave no -- take no option off the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No one denies the impact the sanctions are having, but they also don\'t appear to be dissuading Iran from moving forward with its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Secretary Panetta\'s assertion that they could do it within a year put a timetable on the President for making a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s an estimate based on the administration\'s view about the development of the process in Iran.\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change our strategy, which is continue to put pressure, continue to isolate, continue to make clear to Iran what its options are and how outside the international community their behavior has placed them, and also make clear that we\'re not removing any options off the table -- from the table -- and then move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, are there signs that, other than having a clear impact on the Iranian economy, the strategy is having an effect on their decision to go forward --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, I appreciate the question, but what signs would you look for economic sanctions to have except for on the economy?\xc2\xa0 So that\'s -- they are having the desired effect.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, the diplomatic/sanctions approach we hope will have the effect of changing Iranian behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is certainly important to push that process forward, working with our international partners, and it is simply a fact that we have a situation where the world is united against Iran on this issue, and Iran internally is divided, which is the reversal of the world as it was when President Obama took office, where the world -- or much of it was blaming the United States in its approach to this for what was clearly Iran\xe2\x80\x99s problem.\xc2\xa0 And through the policies of this President, and the approach that this President has taken, the world now sees Iranian behavior for what it is, and that has resulted in the kind of sanctions regime that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to put together.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post reported on Friday that the DOD is taking what was supposed to be a decommissioned warship and turning it into a large floating base, reportedly headed to the Middle East somewhere.\xc2\xa0 Can you say specifically where it\xe2\x80\x99s headed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that this might be perceived as antagonistic towards Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would refer to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 As is the case with the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, our presence there is part of a rotation that has not changed at all and ensures that we maintain a significant presence in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding the specific issue that you just mentioned, I would refer you to the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, Jay, Occupy Wall Street protesters are making headlines again.\xc2\xa0 As you know over the weekend, 400 protesters were arrested in Oakland, and now today the National Park Service is expected to clear out protesters, potentially as we speak, from a site here in D.C.\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction?\xc2\xa0 And is the administration concerned that some of these protesters are taking things too far?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, with regards to Oakland, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a local law enforcement matter.\xc2\xa0 Here in Washington, I would refer you for specifics to the U.S. National Park Service and the U.S. Park Police.\xc2\xa0 And our position has been and continues to be that we need to balance First Amendment concerns of the right to demonstrate, the right to speak freely, with public safety concerns and public health concerns.\xc2\xa0 And we understand that whether -- that local law enforcement, as well as, in this case, the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police, are weighing those considerations when they make these decisions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since Mr. Grossman, Mark Grossman, was unable to get into Pakistan, has the President had any discussions with him specifically about that matter and about the state of our relations with Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 Plus, I have a related question, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you now, which is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any conversations the President has had with Mr. Grossman.\xc2\xa0 Broadly, I could give you our view of U.S.-Pakistani relations and the fact that that relationship has been and continues to be complicated but is very important to our national security interest, to our fight against al Qaeda, and to the stability of the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s our broad view.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on the President and Ambassador Grossman.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you also -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been some time since we got any kind of announcements about the AfPak meetings.\xc2\xa0 Why has that fallen off?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk about how many meetings he\xe2\x80\x99s had since the last time we heard about those meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a high priority, a national security priority for the President.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very transparent about the implementation process of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be.\xc2\xa0 We are in now a phase of drawing down the surge forces as we begin the transition to Afghan security lead that will reach a culmination in 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of meetings of the AfPak group, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an issue that is discussed frequently in the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security time with his National Security Council advisors.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?\xc2\xa0 Coming back to Syria for a moment, the Turks tried a few months ago to have talks with Assad and try to come to a settlement.\xc2\xa0 And at that time, the President waited for a few days but then told Prime Minister Erdogan, you know, this is not working, we have to move on.\xc2\xa0 And so I wonder why in light of that precedent, you even said that -- you sounded somewhat open to the Russian effort.\xc2\xa0 Why would the Russians --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support efforts to bring about a solution that results in the Assad regime leaving, to the peaceful transition to democracy that the Syrian people demand and deserve, and we welcome efforts toward those ends by the Arab League, by the Russians, by the Turkish government.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is -- because we share the goal here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stop you from pushing for a resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 It will not stop us.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re sending Hillary Clinton up to New York just to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are.\xc2\xa0 She\'s going up the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 I believe she\'s put out a statement just within the last hour or so on this issue and making our position very clear.\xc2\xa0 The Security Council should not permit the Assad regime to assault the Syrian people while it rejects the Arab League\'s proposal for a political solution.\xc2\xa0 As I said before, governments that act to prop up Assad\'s brutal regime will find themselves in a small minority, and criticized for abetting further human rights violations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause Assad\'s fall is inevitable.\xc2\xa0 And as we -- as countries make this determination about where they -- the approach they want to take to this issue, they should understand that the genie is out of the bottle -- Assad\'s regime will fall. It will not -- the status quo ante will not pertain again.\xc2\xa0 And everybody needs to work towards a peaceful transition in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last time around, the administration was willing to give the Turks a little bit of time to see whether they could make something happen.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like this time you\'re saying to the Russians, okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, we support you, but we\'re going to go full-steam ahead at the U.N.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s an either/or; I think it\'s a both/and.\xc2\xa0 And obviously these processes don\xe2\x80\x99t all happen when you just snap your fingers.\xc2\xa0 This is part of working with the international community, working with our partners and allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as we saw just over the weekend, the level of carnage in Syria seems to be increasing; the appalling brutality is not abating at all.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important that the international community come together to make clear to the regime that this is unacceptable and it has to stop.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, many people have heard the rumors about the First Lady\'s purchases in New York.\xc2\xa0 I know it\'s British tabloids, but can you help us squash this rumor?\xc2\xa0 In light of other --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Neal, I\'m shocked that you\'re the one to ask this question.\xc2\xa0 But let me just answer and say that, at least when I was a reporter, usually the standard for British tabloid reporting was the assumption that it was false.\xc2\xa0 In this case, it\'s utterly false, and it\'s irresponsible of an American news organization to repeat the story, even allowing that it could be true.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you provide some evidence that it\'s wrong?\xc2\xa0 Because I\'d hate to print some incorrect information.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, can you provide -- I\'m not going to go there, Neal.\xc2\xa0 It\'s false.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us the President\'s thinking in deciding to go to the Alfalfa Club dinner on Saturday night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has attended this particular dinner before.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly a tradition here in our great nation\'s capital for sitting Presidents to attend these functions on occasion.\xc2\xa0 I think they would all wish that it were annual.\xc2\xa0 In this case -- in this President\'s case, it has not been with either this dinner or the Grid Iron.\xc2\xa0 He enjoyed himself.\xc2\xa0 He hopes that his speech entertained.\xc2\xa0 I certainly thought it was funny.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to see all of the speech.\xc2\xa0 You put out excerpts, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t put out a transcript.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe the Alfalfa Club has a long tradition of -- I think we\'re pushing the envelope here in terms of its traditions and our release of excerpts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol, you\'re awfully quiet over there.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, on the Google thing tonight, are you guys monitoring those questions, or is Google doing -- who\'s going to choose --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s Google+ that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House isn\'t doing any screening of the questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I know we\'re not picking the questions.\xc2\xa0 Would that we could.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tConnie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Has the President ever said anything about this long, extensive series of primaries and debates?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe, especially in this time of economic hardship, that these are really a good thing for the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the primary process is the way that we in this country choose our nominees for the major political parties.\xc2\xa0 He obviously participated in a very long process four years ago, and he looks forward to the time when there is a nominee from the other party and for that debate to be joined.\xc2\xa0 But the process has a long tradition behind it.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There was a report a week ago that the Labor Department and other agencies had already given their thumbs-up to an executive order that would bar -- that would expand the existing executive order barring discrimination in federal contracting based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and that the issue is at the White House for review.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that report?\xc2\xa0 And do you know if and when the White House is going to approve that order?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t confirm it.\xc2\xa0 I will take the question and look into it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:25 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
