Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Please accept my apologies for the late start today. \xc2\xa0Let me do one thing at the top, and then we\'ll get to your questions and we can get going here.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President received an update today from his Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco about the forecast for Hurricane Joaquin. \xc2\xa0He received additional details about the preparations that are underway at FEMA in advance of the storm. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tA couple of those points: \xc2\xa0FEMA has increased its staffing at our 24-hour watch center in Washington, D.C. to provide additional reporting and monitoring of the situation. \xc2\xa0FEMA incident management assistance teams and other lead elements have either deployed or are preparing to deploy to potentially affected areas to support response activities and ensure there are no unmet needs. \xc2\xa0FEMA staff have been activated to prepare for the establishment of potential incident support bases, which pre-position supplies like water, meals, blankets, and other resources closer to potentially affected areas. \xc2\xa0And of course, FEMA maintains significant stockpiles of commodities including millions of liters of water, meals, blankets, and other resources like that at distribution centers across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final thing I\'ll say here is that, particularly at this point, we encourage all Americans that live in areas that could potentially be affected by Hurricane Joaquin to monitor local radio, television, and official social media accounts for updated emergency information, and as always, to follow the instructions of state, local and tribal officials. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this obviously is something that the President and his team are closely monitoring here, and I anticipate we\'ll be doing that through the weekend. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, Kevin, we can go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President, in New York, had high praise for the Secret Service in recent days for the work they did last week. \xc2\xa0But what is the White House reaction to the reports that agents widely accessed a committee chairman\xe2\x80\x99s personnel file and that aspects of that file eventually became public? \xc2\xa0Are apologies enough in this case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, as you point out, the Director of the Secret Service and the Secretary of Homeland Security both called Congressman Chaffetz personally to offer an apology on behalf of the agency. \xc2\xa0Both men, both Director Clancy and Secretary Johnson, indicated a commitment to holding accountable those who may have improperly handled information. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously an agency like the Secret Service takes very seriously the responsibility that they have to properly handle sensitive information, and the report that was released does raise significant concerns about whether or not all those procedures were followed -- or at least whether those procedures were followed properly. \xc2\xa0So I do think we -- the President certainly has confidence that the appropriate steps will be taken to hold accountable those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow those procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would be remiss if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t restate something that I mentioned yesterday, which is that we did see a significant mobilization under the command of the Secret Service over the last week to professionally and effectively provide security for the visiting dignitaries to the United States. \xc2\xa0That included President Xi who made a high-profile visit to the United States, including his visit here to the White House; obviously, Pope Francis; as well as more than 100 dignitaries in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Secret Service wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just responsible for providing for the security of each of those individuals; particularly when it comes to the Pope, there were hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans over the course of his visit who made an effort to try to see him, and the Secret Service was responsible not just for his security, but also for the security of those Americans who participated in those events.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think the results of that visit and the security that was provided is a testament to the tremendous professionalism and competence of the men and women in the Secret Service. \xc2\xa0And when there are mistakes that are made, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Director do the right thing, which is step up and take responsibility for them, offer an apology where it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate, but also assure not just Congressman Chaffetz but also the President and the American people that there will be accountability. \xc2\xa0And I think we can have confidence that that will happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President lost confidence in leadership over there to address this appropriately?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not at all. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, I think their initial response to this report I think is a strong indication that there is effective leadership in place at the Secret Service, to say nothing of the effective completion of the very difficult but core mission that the Secret Service carried out over the last week or so in the midst of a series of high-profile visits.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0Russia\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister says his country and the U.S. coalition see eye-to-eye on targets of their fight against terrorism in Syria. \xc2\xa0Is that accurate? \xc2\xa0And does that reflect the activity over the past 48 hours, as the U.S. sees it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as the Secretary of Defense acknowledged yesterday in his news conference, the early indications from the Russian military operations is that despite their claims that they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on ISIL, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually carrying out military operations where there are few, if any, ISIL forces operating. \xc2\xa0So it certainly calls into question that declaration. \xc2\xa0And it raises the concerns that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us state previously about how -- if Russia is genuinely focused on fighting ISIL, then they will make the kind of constructive contribution to the 65-member anti-ISIL coalition that the United States is leading. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have put forward a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and we are working with 65 other countries to implement that strategy. \xc2\xa0And we would welcome the constructive contribution of Russia to that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, following up on that, does President Obama feel that President Putin broke his word after their meeting this week with regard to their intentions in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the conversation that the two Presidents had focused on a range of things -- about the shared interest that we have in stopping the spread of ISIL extremists, and certainly to counter the safe haven that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to establish for themselves inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0There was also a shared view when it came to the need for a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have long made the case that the root of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s problems is the political turmoil inside of Syria, and the only way to address whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the spread of ISIL or the significant humanitarian crisis that started in Syria is to address the fundamental political problem there. \xc2\xa0And the case that we have made, and the case that generally Russia has acknowledged, is the need for a political transition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there are important differences of opinion about what that political transition ultimately looks like, but there was agreement about the need for some kind of political transition inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m referring more to the airstrikes, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And so when it comes to the airstrikes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that we would welcome a constructive contribution from Russia to the anti-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen them be prepared to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you also agreed that there would be talks to de-conflict the operations. \xc2\xa0These Russian airstrikes today happened before those talks. \xc2\xa0Does that indicate that the talks are even worth having?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They are worth having, Jeff, and they continue to be both a priority for President Obama and for President Putin. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, I can tell you that there was a call that was hosted today by U.S. defense officials and some of their Russian counterparts. \xc2\xa0This is a telephone call that lasted about an hour today; it took place via video teleconference. \xc2\xa0It was led by Elissa Slotkin over at the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0She is the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. \xc2\xa0The discussion focused on ways the United States and Russia can communicate and effectively de-conflict our operations inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in some cases, these were actually some basic aspects of our operations that we want to try to agree to, to avoid unintended consequences here. \xc2\xa0So there was a discussion about ensuring that military aircraft inside of Syria are operating consistent with international rules and safety regulations. \xc2\xa0There was a discussion about ensuring that military personnel operating inside of Syria are communicating on internationally recognized channels. \xc2\xa0And all of this is an effort to de-conflict our ongoing operations there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was the first discussion of what I anticipate will be a series of additional discussions about de-conflicting our efforts. \xc2\xa0And in the context of that call, I\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t point out that, once again, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense, Elissa Slotkin, underscored the importance of focusing our efforts on our shared objective, which is degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0And she pointed out that the Russian military operations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far raise some concerns because Russia is targeting areas where there are few, if any, ISIL forces operating.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything that the United States is doing or can do to protect the Syrian opposition from these Russian airstrikes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, I think the challenge here is one -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0I think the burden here is on Russia. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, carrying out indiscriminate military operations against the Syrian opposition is dangerous for Russia. And the reason I say that is that it is only going to prolong the sectarian conflict inside of Syria, if not make that conflict indefinite, and it also risks Russia being drawn even more deeply into that conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen -- and I say this, knowing that Russia has already acknowledged that there\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution inside of Syria -- that ultimately a political transition will be required. \xc2\xa0And Russia, as I mentioned yesterday, will be no more successful in imposing a military solution on Syria than the United States was in imposing a military solution on Iraq, or than the Soviet Union was in imposing a military solution on Afghanistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe way that Russia has carried out these indiscriminate strikes against the Syrian opposition has also further isolated Russia. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements of concern from members of the U.S.-led anti-ISIL coalition, statements from Turkey and Jordan, and other leaders in the region, but also around the world, raising concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activities. \xc2\xa0And I think, most tellingly, we saw statements from both Iran and Saudi Arabia on this matter. \xc2\xa0And those who understand the nature of this sectarian conflict will not be surprised to hear that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military activities was one that was filled with words of praise, while the statement from Saudi Arabia was filled with words of criticism. \xc2\xa0And I think that highlights the risk that Russia is running here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I guess the two last things I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out here is that the effect of these kinds of indiscriminate airstrikes essentially drives what would otherwise be moderate elements of the Sunni opposition to Assad into the arms of extremists, creating an extremist problem -- or I guess I should say exacerbating an extremist problem -- for Russia inside of Syria, but also exacerbating the extremist problem that Russia has inside of Russia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why you heard me say when there were initial reports about Russia moving military equipment to Syria that it would be counterproductive for Russia to double down on the support of President Assad, this is exactly what I was talking about. \xc2\xa0And this is going to have consequences for the efforts of everybody, including Russia, to counter extremism in the region and around the world. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, these grave consequences for Russia are more dangerous than any diplomatic response that could be imposed on Russia by the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President happy with what Russia is doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Obviously we would prefer Russia to make a constructive contribution to our ongoing anti-ISIL effort, and it certainly is not in the interest of the United States for Russia to exacerbate this sectarian conflict. \xc2\xa0But ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s the Russians that will pay the highest price for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the Russians seem to be particularly targeting groups funded and armed by the CIA. \xc2\xa0How will the President respond? \xc2\xa0And this is a renewal of the Cold War-like war of proxies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not at all. \xc2\xa0And here\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand. \xc2\xa0I was making reference to indiscriminate --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not indiscriminate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- airstrikes. \xc2\xa0Well, I think it is indiscriminate, because -- and let me explain why. \xc2\xa0Because Russia, in justifying these actions, suggests that they are carrying out operations against opponents to the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0The fact is there are extremist, ideologically-driven, essentially terrorists who are opponents of the Assad regime -- \xc2\xa0these are groups like ISIL and Nusra -- that have been the focus of our operations. \xc2\xa0There are also elements of the Syrian opposition that could more accurately be described as moderate elements of the Syrian opposition that are simply arming themselves to try to defend their communities, their homes, and themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime has been carrying out terrible acts of violence against these civilians. \xc2\xa0And so that\'s the kind of indiscriminate activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Russia engaged in. \xc2\xa0And the danger associated with that kind of indiscriminate military action is that it distracts from the organizations that should be the focal point of these kinds of activities -- namely ISIL -- and serves to drive away the kind of moderate opposition that ultimately the international community, including Russia, is going to be counting on to be a part of the political transition that\'s long overdue inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, Josh, the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m pushing back on the \xe2\x80\x9cindiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d is your own military analysts are saying that these attacks are actually very well thought out. \xc2\xa0They\'re going after the people that now are the greatest threat to the Assad regime and also are closest to Russian military facilities. \xc2\xa0Those people also happen to be the people who are being funded by the CIA sort of on our side, so that it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- they\'re not doing this willy-nilly. \xc2\xa0They are going after the people who represent the worst threat to the Assad regime and their own position in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just issue a clear disclaimer once again, which is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in a specific discussion of any activities that the CIA may be involved in or may not be involved in inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0What I will say as a general matter, though, is that there -- and this is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, which is that there are opposition groups inside of Syria that have benefitted from U.S. support, and there is a variety of ways in which that support has been provided. \xc2\xa0It includes the training-and-equipping operation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in here that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yielded the kind of results that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see. \xc2\xa0But it also includes support in the form of things like medical equipment, rations and other supplies that are useful to fighting forces in a difficult environment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are also moderate Syrian opposition groups with whom we have no relationship. \xc2\xa0The fact is these kinds of groups that are operating against the Assad regime are pretty fluid. \xc2\xa0And the fact that these kinds of alliances are so fluid actually underscores the risk that Russia is taking; that by taking strikes against these moderate Syrian opposition groups, they only make it more likely that these -- what could currently be described as moderate Syrian opposition groups seek to align themselves with the extremist ideologues that Russia claims to be fighting.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the concern that we have. \xc2\xa0And that is the risk that Russia is running when they wade knee-deep into this sectarian conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your view -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about all these risks that Putin seems to be taking on. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s not an idiot. What is the White House view of what Putin is trying to achieve here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use that word to describe President Putin, that\xe2\x80\x99s correct. \xc2\xa0But I think for weeks now we have indicated a lack of clarity about what Russia\xe2\x80\x99s true intentions are inside of Syria, and that is to say -- that is not to leave anybody with the impression that the United States was somehow surprised that Russia was actually using that military equipment that they moved into Syria in the last few weeks, but rather to describe the choice that President Putin faces about how to protect Russia\xe2\x80\x99s diminishing influence inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, Syria has been the client state of Russia in the Middle East for years. \xc2\xa0And Russia has made a significant investment in that client state, and over the last five years, Russia has seen that client state essentially unravel. \xc2\xa0And it has risked the significant investment that they have in that country, and this significant military deployment is aimed at shoring it up. \xc2\xa0And the question that President Putin faces is how exactly to shore that up. \xc2\xa0And continuing down a path of carrying out military operations in an indiscriminate fashion against the Syrian opposition is actually going to run counter to the stated goals of Russia because it only will prolong the sectarian conflict that has torn that country apart.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0I want to put this gently, but there seems to be this view that Putin keeps stealing your lunch money. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of -- that he seems to be --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that before.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, exactly. \xc2\xa0Is there -- you just have to sort of wait out that view? \xc2\xa0I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s this sense of this sort of playground battle that he seems to be getting the best of the President on. \xc2\xa0How do you fight that, or can you not? \xc2\xa0Or do you just leave that aside?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me take that on in a couple of different ways. \xc2\xa0I think the first is that if you examine the interests of other countries in the region, that is not at all what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. \xc2\xa0The fact is, Russia is responding to a situation inside the Middle East from a position of weakness. \xc2\xa0Their influence in that region of the world is waning. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the media reports that pointed out that the military base that Russia operates inside of Syria is actually the last military base that Russia operates outside of the former Soviet Union. \xc2\xa0And that base is located in the country that over the last five years has been torn apart, and where the security situation there is highly unstable at best. \xc2\xa0And Russia is responding to that urgent situation trying to shore up their investment. \xc2\xa0So this has not been a long-term benefit from Russia. \xc2\xa0This is Russia trying to salvage what\xe2\x80\x99s left of a deteriorating situation inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the second thing is a careful consideration of U.S. interests. \xc2\xa0The President has been very clear from the beginning that the prolonged commitment of U.S. military personnel on the ground inside of Syria is not something the President was willing to consider. \xc2\xa0And instead, we have implemented a strategy that has put the safety and security of the American people at the top of the list. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I walked through yesterday some of the military actions that the United States has taken inside of Syria to take extremists off the battlefield there, and this includes operations against individuals like Abu Sayyaf, who was killed in a U.S. military raid inside of Syria over the summer; and ISIL operative named Junaid Hussain, who was actually a British national, who was recruiting Western targets for lone-wolf attacks. \xc2\xa0And this includes also an ISIL leader and foreign fighter recruiter named Tariq al-Harzi; to say nothing of the strike that was taken against David Drugeon, who was a French national but an extremist operating inside of Syria -- not affiliated with ISIL, but yet very focused on planning significant attacks against Western targets including the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has worked aggressively to safeguard our interests in that without making the kind of commitment that draws the United States into another land war in the Middle East. That is something that the President does not believe serves our interests well. \xc2\xa0And again, I made reference to the fact that that\'s exactly what Russia is getting drawn into and will have to pay the significant price for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said earlier that you and Russia have a shared objective, which is to degrade and destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0Are you confident that that is actually Russia\xe2\x80\x99s objective?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do believe that Russia is being forthright when they say that they are quite concerned about the threat that is posed by ISIL and are prepared to take military action to try to destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\'s not exactly what they\'re doing right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that\'s how we started this briefing, which is that they are taking strikes in the country where there are few, if any, ISIL operatives in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that doesn\'t make you question that that is actually their objective, to destroy ISIL? \xc2\xa0I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I was walking through in response to Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s question are some of our shared priorities. \xc2\xa0That is clearly a priority of the United States. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a stated priority of the Russians, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any reason to dispute that that is one of their priorities. \xc2\xa0I certainly have ample reason to dispute that they\'re taking the actions that are going to accomplish that goal. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think they\'re actually taking actions that are counterproductive to that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First off, I was just wondering if you could give us a tick-tock of what the President has been up to for the last couple days on this -- whether he\xe2\x80\x99s had conversations with Secretary Kerry, the CIA Director, meetings in the Situation Room -- just how he\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed and updated on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have a lot of detail to share with you. \xc2\xa0The President has been briefed by his national security team about events on the ground inside of Syria and the President has had conversations with members of his national security team about it. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any specific meetings to tell you about. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, Russia has been a fluid -- Syria has been a fluid situation for quite some time, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for the President to get updates on the conditions on the ground when things are changing rapidly. \xc2\xa0And that certainly has been the case over the last 24 to 36 hours.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s latest actions have led the President to reconsider either what the U.S. is going to put into Syria, or what the U.S. might do in other regions where we\'re in some sort of conflict with Russia, including Ukraine. \xc2\xa0Obviously, arming Ukraine has been kind of an issue that\'s dangling out there. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if any of those things is under new reconsideration after what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0And I made this point yesterday. \xc2\xa0I would not -- at this point, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the kind of change that would prompt a significant, broad reevaluation of our policy either with regard to Syria or with Ukraine. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just stipulate that I frequently convey to all of you that the President and his team are always reviewing our strategy in Syria and looking for areas where we might be enjoying a little bit more success and sort of refining and reforming our strategy as necessary. \xc2\xa0That\'s part of an ongoing policy process. But this has not caused a broad-scale -- or a broad reevaluation of our strategy inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to Ukraine, the situation there I think is pretty cut and dried, which is we continue to see Russia interfering in eastern Ukraine; we continue to see them destabilizing and violating the territorial integrity of a sovereign nation; and as a result, Russia has sustained serious and worsening economic consequences. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked before about the decline in the value of their currency, the downgraded economic growth projections for Russia, the expectations that their economy will shrink by 3 percent to 4 percent this year and will remain in recession new year. \xc2\xa0They\'re now the world\xe2\x80\x99s 15th largest economy, one step behind Spain, and declining.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the situation in Ukraine, unfortunately, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed. The kind of change we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see is for Russia to begin implementing their side of the bargain when it comes to the Minsk agreements. \xc2\xa0And once they start doing that that is how Russia can start to reintegrate into the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Our friends at Reuters have reported that there\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of Iranian troops that are now entering into Syria to bolster the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if you can confirm that, say if it\'s going to need any steps from the U.S., and also if you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from our regional allies? \xc2\xa0I know that you mentioned statements from the Saudis earlier -- but the Saudis, the Turks \xc2\xa0-- if the Iranian intervention there is going to lead them to either bring more troops, more military equipment, whatever, into the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve actually highlighted what may be the most important piece of evidence to indicate how Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military activity is worsening the sectarian conflict inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0I have seen those reports; we\'re aware of those reports and we\'re taking a look at them. \xc2\xa0I cannot independently confirm them, but if true -- and the reports are coming from a variety of sources -- it would be a rather apt and even powerful illustration of how Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military intervention inside of Syria, focused on an indiscriminate bombing of Syrian opposition targets, has worsened the sectarian conflict there; that you see, at least according to these reports, Iranians racing to Syria to take up arms and join the fight. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is not good news for the Russians. \xc2\xa0And that is consistent with a worsening sectarian conflict that only puts off a political solution -- a political solution that the Russians themselves have made a priority and said would be necessary to solving the problems inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last one -- just on the conversation you had with Gardiner -- I know that you can\'t confirm whether the CIA has backed any of rebel groups that were targets of this bombing, but do you know if any of the targets received U.S. backing of some sort, any sort of assistance? \xc2\xa0And if so, or even if not, what your message to rebel groups that might want to work with the U.S. would be who are worried about that not providing them any protection against the Russians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'ll just restate again that I will not be in a position to discuss any activities that the CIA may or may not be responsible for inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0But for a more specific analysis of the targets that were hit by Russia yesterday I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0I certainly wouldn\'t rule out the possibility that there may be some opposition groups in that part of Syria that have received support in one form or another from the United States. \xc2\xa0And again, it reflects the risk that Russia is taking by carrying out these kinds of indiscriminate operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy failing to discriminate between ideologically driven extremists like ISIL and Nusra and moderate Syrian opposition elements that have a political concern with President Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and have taken up arms solely to defend their families and their communities is going to lead to bad outcomes for Russia. \xc2\xa0It\'s only going to deepen the sectarian conflict. \xc2\xa0It\'s only going to further inflame sectarian tensions inside of Syria that results in more Sunnis directing their ire at Russia, both inside of Syria and back home in Russia. \xc2\xa0That is the risk that Russia is running right now. \xc2\xa0And it has significant consequences for the national security of Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Real last one. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I know that you said that you weren\'t surprised that Russia used its military equipment that they were bringing in. \xc2\xa0Were you surprised by the targets that they had chosen in this mission?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There had not been a discussion between the Presidents in their meeting in New York on Monday that included operational details. \xc2\xa0So there was not advance notice that was provided other than the notification that was provided to the United States by a Russian military official in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President spoke some time ago about what he wants to accomplish before he turns the keys over to the next President. \xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear Syria is going to be a mess at the end of the second term. \xc2\xa0I mean, what realistically at this point does he hope to accomplish?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sort of, on a day-to-day basis, draw conclusions about an environment that\xe2\x80\x99s so fluid. \xc2\xa0But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that what the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority has been all along is to prevent extremist organizations using the chaos inside of Syria to establish a safe haven that could then be used to attack U.S. interests or even the U.S. homeland. \xc2\xa0And that will continue to be the focus of our efforts there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I guess what I would say in terms of over the next year, what kind of progress do we want to make, making progress in terms of applying pressure and even taking out leading ISIL figures operating inside of Syria and Iraq would be a priority; further strengthening and, where possible, expanding the international coalition that we have built to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe added three new members to the ISIL coalition just this week. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of sort of the further expansion of that coalition. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen recent announcements from the British and the French about the possibility that they would take additional action inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the members of that coalition are becoming even more active in it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then the third thing -- and in some ways, this is the most difficult one -- is there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- for all this discussion of our military actions there, which are critical to the national security of the American people -- for all of that military action, we are going to ultimately need a political transition. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution that can be imposed on Syria. \xc2\xa0A political solution will be required.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd hopefully, over the next year or so, we can make more progress than we have so far in trying to at least build a mechanism for talks about a political transition to take place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Putin have a point when he said at the U.N. that right now, the only force -- this is back to the military component -- the only forces on the ground that are battling extremist groups like ISIS are the forces of President Assad and Kurdish militias?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- you can check with the Department of Defense on this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that President Putin has a very strong case when he talks about Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces fighting ISIL. \xc2\xa0The fact is, Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces have predominantly been engaged in the areas where we saw Russia take strikes yesterday, and again, those are areas where there are few, if any, ISIL forces. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that his case is very strong there.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis case is stronger when he talks about the effectiveness of some Syrian Kurds and Syrian Arabs who have been taking the fight to ISIL on the ground. \xc2\xa0But those are precisely the opposition that the United States and our coalition partners have been actively supporting, both through airstrikes and supporting their efforts on the ground, but also in providing the kinds of equipment and material that are valuable in a fighting environment like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But then just this last question. \xc2\xa0So the President\xe2\x80\x99s resolve -- he has said consistently for some time now, that Assad must go -- remains. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no -- you\xe2\x80\x99re adding the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow,\xe2\x80\x9d and you have for some time said \xe2\x80\x9cultimately\xe2\x80\x9d-- \xe2\x80\x9cultimately\xe2\x80\x9d a political transition. \xc2\xa0Is there any solution that would involve the Russians, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as necessary, that would continue Assad\xe2\x80\x99s role as the President of that country for some period of time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me explain the use of the world \xe2\x80\x9cultimately.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The reason I keep using that has less to do with Assad and more about explaining why -- if a political solution is required, why the United States continues to take robust military action to protect the country. \xc2\xa0And by saying this situation only ends with a political solution, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody to be left with the impression that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do anything until we start to a political solution. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I typically use the word \xe2\x80\x9cultimately\xe2\x80\x9d there, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do these other things to protect our interests and to protect the country while we pursue a political solution.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when it comes to Assad -- a legitimate question -- the things that Assad has done inside of Syria, perpetrating terrible acts of violence against innocent civilians, have caused him to lose the legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to legitimacy in two different ways. \xc2\xa0The first is, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost the moral legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0No leader who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to use the military of that country to carry out heinous acts of violence against that country\xe2\x80\x99s citizens is fit to lead the country. \xc2\xa0So there is a simple moral case about what Bashar al-Assad has perpetrated on other human beings -- Syrian citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s also a more practical argument to be made about how Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country, which is that there are -- that depending on sort of how you draw the lines, probably 80 percent of the Syrian population no longer views him as a legitimate leader of Syria. \xc2\xa0He no longer exercises authority in the areas where they live. \xc2\xa0They no longer view him as a legitimate leader of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try to unify that country again -- something that Secretary Kerry has said that Foreign Minister Lavrov told him is a priority of the Russians -- that just as a practical matter, just doing the math, if 80 percent of the country is not controlled by or is viewed by [views] Assad as a legitimate leader, it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible for him to continue to lead that country -- which is why we need the kind of political transition that includes a moderate Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is the inherent tension in the case that the Russians continue to make. \xc2\xa0They say, well, we need a political solution inside of Syria and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re supporting Assad. \xc2\xa0It is not possible to have a political transition inside of Syria that results in Assad continuing to lead the country because he\xe2\x80\x99s not supported by the vast majority of those country\xe2\x80\x99s citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you used the word \xe2\x80\x9cindiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d many times today, and I want to try to see if you and the administration are arguing that it is indiscriminate because it\xe2\x80\x99s an accident, or it\xe2\x80\x99s indiscriminate because it\xe2\x80\x99s intentional. \xc2\xa0Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between the two, and it goes to the likely U.S. response should this behavior continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me try to say it more clearly, which is that we believe it is important -- and this is clear in the operations that the United States and our coalition partners have carried out -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important to discriminate between the targets that you\xe2\x80\x99re considering. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States and our coalition partners have discriminated in those targets. \xc2\xa0We have focused on hitting ISIL targets, predominantly. \xc2\xa0There are other extremist organizations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously carried out strikes against. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve avoided taking strikes against members of the moderate Syrian opposition. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s Russia -- and the Assad regime, frankly -- that have essentially described the Syrian opposition as essentially one unit. \xc2\xa0And failing to discriminate between ideologically driven terrorists and Syrian citizens who are just trying to defend their homes and their communities and their families is a grave mistake that will lead Russia even deeper into a sectarian conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you for that. \xc2\xa0Is it an intentional mistake by Russia? \xc2\xa0Because there are some who look at it and say Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really know the terrain that well, they\xe2\x80\x99re bombing lots of different things and are not really sure what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, do you believe and does this administration believe Russia, in fact, knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a miscalculation, from your point of view, but it is, nevertheless, intentional?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is a grave miscalculation, and it is one that carries significant risks for Russia and for the broader region. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reason to call into question their ability to hit the targets that they intend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s intentional?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s intentional.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think they are hitting the targets that they intended to hit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Although I do believe that that is -- and it is the position of the United States and, I think, many observers that that is counterproductive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So help me understand what you are saying today and what Ash Carter said yesterday. \xc2\xa0Ash Carter said many things, -- among them, the most colorful metaphor of the day, the prize goes to him for \xe2\x80\x9cpouring gasoline on a fire.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0What I hear you saying is, this is a gross miscalculation; we\xe2\x80\x99re more or less content with the Russians screwing this up in their own way, and are willing to sort of stand by and watch them inherit all the negative things we think are going to come from this. \xc2\xa0So which is it? \xc2\xa0A gross miscalculation they\xe2\x80\x99re going to come to rue, or pouring gasoline on a fire?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Major, I think Secretary Carter -- you can ask his spokesman, but based on what I saw on -- well, I read the transcript last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We both did.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We did. \xc2\xa0So the point that I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make is actually the same one that I am -- that by wading more deeply into the sectarian conflict, by carrying out military operations indiscriminately against the Syrian opposition, they\xe2\x80\x99re only fanning the flames of the sectarian conflict. \xc2\xa0And the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making is that Russia will have to pay the costs for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, let me also be clear that we don\xe2\x80\x99t view that in the U.S. interest either, because -- and the reason I make that point is -- I just sort of described to Jon that one of the sort of three things we hoped we could make progress on would include a political transition inside of Syria because that ultimately will be necessary to solve all of the problems plaguing Syria, including the ability of extremist organizations to create a safe haven inside of Syria, or to address this terrible humanitarian crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in terms of the refugee problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the problem, though, is that by exacerbating the sectarian conflict, the Russians are essentially prolonging the sectarian conflict, and making a political resolution much more difficult to achieve. \xc2\xa0And the consequences will principally be borne by the Russians who will be inspiring the anger and violence of many Sunnis inside of Syria, including potentially some Sunnis that could previously be described as moderate.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no satisfaction I take in conveying to you that Russia is making a grave error and miscalculation here, but it is a fact. \xc2\xa0And it, frankly, is why Secretary Kerry continues to engage in conversations with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage in conversations through this operational military channel to ensure that our operations are properly de-conflicted. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States is going to continue to lead an international coalition to pursue our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0So since you consider this an intentional act from Russia, do you believe that the targeting of the forces we are supplying and backing, by whatever means, is an act of aggression against the United States and its interests in Syria, and therefor ought to be subject to a formal diplomatic and strategic protest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say with a lot of specificity precisely which targets Russia hit. \xc2\xa0So I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you know they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit, you know that we\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of them, and you believe it to be generally intentional. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you, is that act of aggression against the United States and its interests worthy of a protest to the Soviet -- to the Russian government? \xc2\xa0Forgive me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear -- and Mark and I had this conversation yesterday -- that certainly Russian military activities against opposition groups that are genuinely fighting ISIL do come into conflict with out counter-ISIL strategy. \xc2\xa0And we have made that point clear to the Russians. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it has taken the form of a formal diplomatic rebuke of some kind, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no mistaking our perspective on this, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been conveyed to the Russians in a variety of channels.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to get a big-picture view of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy in this region in particular. \xc2\xa0Can you give me a grade at this stage, given all that\xe2\x80\x99s happening? \xc2\xa0It has been fluid, and I know that you said that there\xe2\x80\x99s always a constant and ongoing evaluation. \xc2\xa0But if you were grading right now, what grade would you give the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would hesitate to do the letter grade thing because the situation on the ground is fluid. \xc2\xa0But I think that we have been pretty forthright about our concern about the situation inside of Syria, and it\xe2\x80\x99s multifaceted. \xc2\xa0Certainly one principal area of concern is the unthinkably terrible humanitarian situation inside of Syria and in the region that has been caused by Syrians fleeing violence inside their country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking to read some of the accounts of these otherwise innocent Syrian families who have been terrorized in their own homes, subjected to violence either by extremists like ISIL, or the Assad regime, and been forced to leave their homes and, in some cases, even leave their country. \xc2\xa0And that is something that, I think, as the President has described, is something that stirs our conscience.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that there are extremists that are operating inside of Syria, and we see ISIL extremists trying to establish a safe haven inside of Syria that they could use to not just destabilize Iraq but also to inspire acts of violence in other places as well. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a subject of some concern, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So barring a grade, would you say you\xe2\x80\x99re dissatisfied with the way things are going, broadly speaking?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who says that they\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied about the situation in Syria right now. \xc2\xa0What is true is that the United States has been effective in building and leading an international coalition of 65 countries to implement an integrated strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And there have been important military actions that have been taken against leading ISIL targets. \xc2\xa0Those are strikes that have made the United States safer. \xc2\xa0We have made some progress in shutting off different lines of financing that ISIL has used to fund their reign of terror. \xc2\xa0We have also been ramping up and made some progress -- modest progress -- in countering ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to use social media to radicalize individuals around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that there haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- and what\xe2\x80\x99s also true in Syria is that by backing some moderate Syrian opposition elements, they had been successful in driving ISIL out of about 17,000 square kilometers of territory inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0That is principally in northern and northeastern Syria where that progress has been made, but it has limited ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s access to the border with Turkey. \xc2\xa0And there is some active effort underway that includes our allies in Turkey to seal off entirely that 600-mile-long border.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are areas where we can point to some important progress, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that would say they\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with how things are going in Syria right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to switch gears for a second and ask you about Bibi Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s comments today at the U.N. \xc2\xa0He made a very powerful statement about the fact that he felt that not enough people in that body were coming to the defense of the people of Israel, and he criticized them for standing by -- deafening silence. \xc2\xa0Is he right about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an opportunity to see his speech. \xc2\xa0Frankly, I was spending a lot of time preparing for the other questions we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing today. \xc2\xa0What I will say is that when it comes to a nation that is ready and willing to come to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s defense, no one has been more loyal than the United States of America, including under the leadership of Barack Obama. \xc2\xa0And the President is proud of the strong relationship between our countries and the unshakeable bond when it comes to our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Can you tell me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Russia facing now the same legitimate question you faced when you were putting together the coalition to fight ISIL in Syria, which is, could you fight the extremists inside Syria without propping up Assad? Because the Russians would say, well, it took the United States a long time in the train-and-equip program to vet who is an extremist and who is a moderate opposition, and still you failed to really distinguish and ascertain the moderate opposition in Syria that\xe2\x80\x99s worth equipping and training.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would acknowledge that it has taken some time to build the capacity of opposition forces on the ground inside of Syria who can take the fight to ISIL. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress, but there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a whole lot more to be done. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem is that progress that they have made is progress that they have made not because of the Assad regime, but actually in spite of it. \xc2\xa0The fact is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve often seen the Assad regime carrying out military operations against moderate elements of the Syrian opposition, and we have not seen the Assad regime demonstrate either the willingness or the capacity to carry out military operations against ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the other tension in the argument that is being made by the Russians, is it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make the case that you\xe2\x80\x99re supporting Assad because you want to fight ISIL when Assad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have either the desire or the capacity to fight ISIL. \xc2\xa0So it exposes a significant flaw in the logic of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s strategy here.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Different subject. \xc2\xa0Last night, you put out a statement, you\xe2\x80\x99re very excited that the government did not shut down, and --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cVery excited\xe2\x80\x9d might be generous. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Pleased, whatever.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Relieved maybe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you called on Congress to pass a budget that would reverse sequestration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are several other big fiscal issues, including highway funding that expires at the end of this month, and debt ceiling increase as well, along with tax extenders, potential tax cuts. \xc2\xa0Do you see that all as one package? \xc2\xa0Or do you think Congress should deal with these individually?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Cheryl, you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified some of the -- some priorities that we have identified. \xc2\xa0Some of them -- I think all of them are important; some are even more important than others. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m referring mostly to the debt limit.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are other economic priorities that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that are also important to us. \xc2\xa0This would include reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and long-delayed action on cybersecurity legislation. \xc2\xa0This is legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s been sitting in the Senate for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long now, but too long. \xc2\xa0And yet, we actually see the Republican leadership holding votes on appropriations bills that they know won\'t pass -- these are appropriations bills that don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of bipartisan support -- while they neglect the kind of cybersecurity legislation that is critical to our economy, that is critical to our national security, and has bipartisan support in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it makes it difficult to explain exactly what Senator McConnell has in mind when it comes to following up on the promise that was included in his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal the day after the election -- \xe2\x80\x9cnow we can get Congress moving again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0If he were actually interested in doing that, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bringing to the floor pieces of legislation that he knows stand no chance of passing, and ignoring legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s critical to our economy and critical to our national security that probably would pass if they did the work that was necessary to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell has talked about a two-year budget plan, though, now, going forward. \xc2\xa0Do you have suggestions on the shape of that, what that should include?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, we have an informed view on all of these things. \xc2\xa0And our priority has been on preventing a government shutdown, essentially reversing the sequester to ensure that our national security and economic priorities are adequately funded. \xc2\xa0That\'s been where our priorities have been.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur view is that we can only accomplish those goals if Democrats and Republicans -- if Republicans are actually willing to work with Democrats to get that done. \xc2\xa0And the last time that Democrats and Republicans were able to work together on budget legislation, they actually did come to a two-year budget agreement. \xc2\xa0Whether that\'s appropriate this time or not remains to be seen. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how things play out. \xc2\xa0But that certainly was something that Democrats and Republicans were able to accomplish together last time they were confronted with this challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Going back to the Secret Service for a second, I was thinking back to some of the other problems the Secret Service has had, and the understandable -- maybe outrageous is overstating it, but certainly a great deal of unhappiness given that the safety and security of the President and his family at times seem to be at risk. \xc2\xa0And I realize that comparing what happened to Congressman Chaffetz isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same, but it doesn\'t seem like there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern on your part. \xc2\xa0Is there concern on the part of the White House or the President that this was -- that this happened to somebody who was so vigorously investigating what was going on in the Secret Service?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chris, it certainly is not routine for the Director of the Secret Service to personally call someone to offer an apology for the conduct of his agency. \xc2\xa0It certainly is extraordinary for the Secretary of Homeland Security to place the same telephone call. \xc2\xa0I think that should be a pretty clear indication to you just how seriously the administration takes this matter, and how seriously the Secret Service takes their responsibility to live up to the high standards that they\xe2\x80\x99ve set for themselves at that agency. \xc2\xa0That includes the effective and proper handling of sensitive information.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is something that the administration, but, more importantly, that the agency takes quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And Director Clancy gave his word to Congressman Chaffetz that those who are responsible for mishandling of this information would be appropriately held accountable, and I have confidence that Director Clancy will do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it something the President takes quite seriously? \xc2\xa0Is he upset about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you about -- a couple more questions, if I can, on Russia, particularly the teleconference that took place today. \xc2\xa0Is this strictly limited to the de-confliction area? \xc2\xa0Or will some of the conversations continue about targets, some of the kinds of conversations that were had between Secretary Kerry and Mr. Lavrov?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that in a couple of different ways. \xc2\xa0The first is, this is the first in what I anticipate will be a series of operational, tactical conversations to effectively de-conflict Russian and U.S. military operations in Syria. \xc2\xa0This is something that President Putin and President Obama discussed starting in their meeting on Monday. \xc2\xa0And on Thursday morning here in Washington, those conversations began.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, based on the readout of the call that I got, it is not clear to me that there was a discussion of some of the things that you described, including targets. \xc2\xa0The discussion focused -- at least when it came to the U.S. agenda -- on ensuring that aircraft are operating consistent with international rules and safety regulations, and ensuring that communications were being conducted on internationally recognized channels. \xc2\xa0So when you have military pilots that are flying aircraft at a high rate of speed, you want to make sure that these kinds of standards are observed by everyone who is operating there and that there is an ability to communicate, if necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are the kinds of basics that were covered in the context of this call from the U.S. side. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Russians read out what they raised. \xc2\xa0But this is just the first in a series of calls, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at this point rule out that there might be a discussion of targets and some other things.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will say, however -- and this is something that was reiterated on the call by the United States directly to the Russians -- is that this call and these consultations do not at all represent a change in our policy of limiting military-to-military cooperation with the Russians as a result of their actions inside of Ukraine. \xc2\xa0That policy has not changed. \xc2\xa0And these conversations will not rise to that kind of broader strategic level. \xc2\xa0These kinds of consultations are important, but they will continue to focus on basic operational, tactical efforts to de-conflict our operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There have been multiple conversations over the last several days between Secretary Kerry and Sergei Lavrov, and at one point yesterday -- before I think that final meeting that went about an hour that was off his schedule -- he came up and said to the media, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the Pentagon.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0How do you read that statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that -- this is from Foreign Minister Lavrov?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what he was referring to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to even venture a -- all right. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And this just happened and so it may not even be on your radar that apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s been a shooting at a community college in Oregon in which there may be some fatalities. \xc2\xa0And again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know any of the details so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to project. \xc2\xa0But I just wonder, as the President looks ahead -- and I know that, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s written or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in his head, there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of this list of his priorities -- when you look at things like limiting access to guns and mental illness and the kinds of things that he spoke about so movingly in places like Newtown, is there a sense that a realistic analysis says that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that can be high on the priority list because it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to get done? \xc2\xa0Or where does that sort of fall as he looks ahead to how he spends his next 15 months or so?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chris, the issue of sensible steps that can be taken to protect our communities from gun violence continues to be a top priority of this administration. \xc2\xa0There are some common-sense steps -- things like closing the gun show loophole and others -- that have strong bipartisan support across the country. \xc2\xa0According to some polling data, there\xe2\x80\x99s even a majority of Republicans that support closing the gun show loophole.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have not yet seen that kind of strong bipartisan support across the country translate into legislative support in the United States Congress that\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient to pass legislation that would, again, implement these kinds of common-sense solutions. \xc2\xa0That said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty candid about the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s no piece of legislation that can be passed into law by the Congress that would prevent every single incident of gun violence, but there are some common-sense things that we can do. And I think the vast majority of the American people share the President\xe2\x80\x99s view in wondering why Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take those kinds of common-sense steps. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has been quite candid about how this is and has been a source of frustration for him. \xc2\xa0It has not at all been lowered on the priority scale, but at the same time, the President is quite realistic that we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to see a fundamental change in terms of the way the American people communicate this priority to Congress before we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a different outcome in the legislative process.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If Russia is hitting these targets -- and many now are saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that they are hitting U.S.-backed fighters -- how much of a setback do you see that to the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s work going forward? \xc2\xa0And if the goal is de-confliction with Russia and they\xe2\x80\x99re hitting people backed by the U.S. and destroying work that has been done, how is that not a confliction? \xc2\xa0And how could that not have been discussed in this initial contact today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I acknowledged yesterday that any sort of Russian effort to take strikes against moderate opposition fighters who are fighting ISIL does come into conflict with our counter-ISIL campaign and does run into conflict with our counter-ISIL strategy. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that quite clear to the Russians.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to what additional conversations might take place in the series of consultations aimed at de-conflicting our military activities inside of Syria, but I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that there might be a discussion of targets in the future. \xc2\xa0But when it came to what the United States raised, we are focused on some more fundamental issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So do you see a warning coming out of this? \xc2\xa0And if they are hitting those targets, which many believe they are, what are the consequences for that? \xc2\xa0Are you thinking possibly some other form of sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the consequence is that Russia is wading more deeply into what is potentially an indefinite sectarian conflict. \xc2\xa0This will serve to isolate Russia internationally. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen significant statements of concern from countries like Turkey and Jordan and others who are part of our anti-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRussia certainly risks deepening and enflaming sectarian tensions in a way that forestalls any sort of political solution inside of Syria -- a political solution that the Russians themselves say will be necessary to accomplishing their goals, to say nothing of the fact that Russia risks driving elements of the moderate Syrian opposition into the arms of extremists that are operating inside of Syria, and enflaming members of the Sunni opposition such that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to carry out acts of violence against Russia inside of Syria or against Russia inside of Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the risk that is freighted with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s strategic decisions here. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned earlier, those consequences that I just outlined are far more grave than any sort of diplomatic consequences that could be imposed by the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So are you saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s no way there would be international diplomatic consequences?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out. \xc2\xa0But it certainly will not be as significant as the prospect of Russia being sucked into a years-long sectarian conflict that only makes them more vulnerable to extremist violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, just to clarify, there is no delight taken here in the United States in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s miscalculations. \xc2\xa0The fact is Russia\xe2\x80\x99s efforts forestall a political solution that we believe is necessary to stabilizing the situation inside of Syria, to prevent the worsening of the humanitarian disaster caused by the refugee crisis, and to prevent the efforts of extremist groups like ISIL from establishing a safe haven inside the chaos of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. not believe that Russia working -- okay, aside from what happens politically down the road, is it not possible that Russia working with the regime now could defeat ISIS?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Michelle, I think that\'s going to be pretty hard for them to do since neither the regime nor the Russians are actually taking strikes against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, for now. \xc2\xa0But --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But again, this --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you say that that is one of their priorities --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This highlights the fundamental contradiction in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s strategy. \xc2\xa0They\'re supporting a regime that is either unwilling or unable to carry out strikes against ISIL. \xc2\xa0And they\'re supporting that regime by taking strikes in areas where ISIL forces are not likely operating.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you still believe that fighting ISIS is one of their priorities?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do take them at their word that they are concerned about the true impact of extremist groups like ISIL continuing to succeed in recruiting foreign terrorist fighters, in radicalizing individuals through social media, and in destabilizing the broader Middle East. \xc2\xa0I think they are genuinely concerned about that. \xc2\xa0As President Putin would tell you, just looking at a globe, Russia is a whole lot closer to the Middle East than the United States is, so they are well aware of the risks that Russia faces from extremism continuing to propagate throughout the Middle East. \xc2\xa0So I do take them at their word that degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL is a goal of theirs. \xc2\xa0But there is a fundamental contradiction in their strategy for which they cannot account.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you see it as an impossibility that they could degrade ISIS to the point of not being able to function, and then whatever happens politically happens after that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it is extremely unlikely that Russia will be able to defeat ISIL if they continue to support a regime that doesn\'t take strikes against ISIL and further enflames the sectarian divide inside of Syria, and if they continue to pursue a military strategy that\'s predicated on taking on strikes not against ISIL but against elements of the Syrian opposition, including some elements of the Syrian opposition that are actually fighting ISIL -- or at least opposed to them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, that is the fundamental contradiction on the Russian position that I think makes clear that they\'re operating from a position of weakness, and that they\'re pursuing the kind of strategy that is clearly not in the interests of the Russian people and will ultimately be counterproductive to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to make progress in the direction of their stated goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Juliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi, two domestic questions for you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First in terms of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new ozone standard to deal with smog -- this has been decried on both sides today. \xc2\xa0Both the environmentalists and public health advocates are upset.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I saw the headline in your story before I came out here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There you go. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Could you talk about what balance you were trying to strike and why you decided to revise it? \xc2\xa0It didn\'t go nearly as far as many of your traditional allies had been calling for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Juliet, for the actual decision behind the formulation of this rule, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the EPA. \xc2\xa0They can give you a much more detailed and technical explanation for how they arrived at their decision. \xc2\xa0Let me just say as a general matter, particularly when it comes to our critics who suggest that these kinds of rules will be bad for the economy, let me just point out that the EPA for more than four decades has been working with state and local agencies to cut air pollution, and in that same period of time, they have succeeded in cutting air pollution by 70 percent, while our economy has tripled. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it certainly calls into question the claims -- the dire claims of some of our critics that this kind of rulemaking is inconsistent with an economic strategy. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President would make a pretty strong case to you that there is a sound economic incentive for the United States and industries in the United States to be more focused on investments in renewable and clean energy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, on John Boehner and the possibility of him being a working partner in the last few weeks he has here on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0Can you give us a sense of to what extent you\'ve seen indications that there may be a possibility to work with him more closely on key priorities before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Juliet, there\xe2\x80\x99s an open line of communication between the White House and Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0Speaker Boehner rather colorfully described his desire to \xe2\x80\x9cclean out the barn\xe2\x80\x9d before he leaves. \xc2\xa0I think that was viewed by many here in the White House, including myself, that that was a rather apt description of what needs to happen in Congress in the next few weeks. \xc2\xa0And if there is an opportunity for the Obama administration to support those efforts, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be a willing partner.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt will, however, require bipartisan cooperation; for any of this business to get taken care of, Republicans will not succeed in passing that legislation along party lines. \xc2\xa0They can\'t -- there simply is not support that they\'re able to muster in Congress sufficient to overcome the filibuster, to say nothing of the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto pen.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if Republicans, including Speaker Boehner, in his last few weeks in office, does want to work in bipartisan fashion to \xe2\x80\x9cclean out the barn,\xe2\x80\x9d then he\xe2\x80\x99ll find partners here at the White House ready to roll up our sleeves and pick up some mops and get to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, I just wanted to ask you about what we\'re seeing over the past two days in Syria. \xc2\xa0Did the actions by Russia over the past two days make it difficult -- more difficult to recruit fighters to the opposition to the Assad government? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, John, I think the way that I would answer your question is actually to remind you of how fluid the situation is on the ground. \xc2\xa0And I do think there is a significant risk that individuals who last week would be described by an informed but impartial analyst as a moderate opposition figure and a potential moderate opposition fighter and a potential moderate opposition political activist -- somebody who could participate in the political transition that\xe2\x80\x99s needed inside of Syria -- that as a result of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions inside of Syria that that individual essentially seeks the comfort and protection of extremists, and that they make common cause with extremists to fight Russia and to fight the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat seems like an entirely likely outcome to me, and it highlights why we take no special delight in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s miscalculation. \xc2\xa0But it also highlights, I think even more importantly, the grave consequences for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s inherently flawed strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And as far as the de-confliction talks which took place today, what\xe2\x80\x99s next? \xc2\xa0Are there more talks? \xc2\xa0Were all the issues resolved today during that one-hour teleconference?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0There will be additional consultations as they work to de-conflict their efforts. \xc2\xa0So I would anticipate additional communications between Assistant Secretary Slotkin and some other members of the U.S. uniformed military and their Russian counterparts.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:45 P.M.
