Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:04 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to hear you all in a good mood on this Friday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Just a nice little buzz in the room when I walked in.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it was the buzz of anticipation.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Either way, I like it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pretty close to a real two-minute warning.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Pretty close.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very punctual.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Pretty close.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, 20 minutes after the scheduled time, however.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, come on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Setting the record straight.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements at the top, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 Darlene, would you like to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Iraq and the airstrike outside of Erbil earlier today, do you expect that there will be additional airstrikes today or over the weekend?\xc2\xa0 And can you also give a sense of how long the President thinks or expects this limited campaign will last for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you described it that way, because the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the authorization the President has been given for military action -- or has given for military action is very limited in scope and was clearly described in the remarks that he delivered last night.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any operational updates to share with you in terms of additional military action.\xc2\xa0 As you pointed out, the Department of Defense did confirm this morning that a military strike was carried out in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So any additional updates will come directly from them.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense does have significant capability and will be prepared to use that capability in pursuit of the goals that the President articulated last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your best definition of \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are two specific ways in which the President described -- well, let me say, I actually would describe them in three different ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, and first and foremost is the protection of American personnel.\xc2\xa0 There are American military and diplomatic officials in Erbil.\xc2\xa0 The artillery position that was maintained by ISIL that was struck by the American military early this morning, East Coast time, was focused on targets that were defending Erbil.\xc2\xa0 And that is why that military strike was authorized, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it occurred.\xc2\xa0 So the protection of American personnel in Iraq is a top priority and one that merits the use of military force.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second is related to this urgent humanitarian situation that exists at Sinjar Mountain.\xc2\xa0 There is a religious and ethnic minority, a population of thousands of people -- men, women and children -- who are stranded at the top of this mountain.\xc2\xa0 ISIL forces are marshaled at the base of the mountain, vowing to kill those who descend.\xc2\xa0 And that is an urgent humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the United States military last night, upon the authorization of the President, carried out successfully an airdrop of supplies, food and water, and some basic medical supplies to those individuals who are stranded on the mountain to try to provide some humanitarian relief.</p>\n<p>The President has authorized military strikes that could be used to address that situation on the mountain.\xc2\xa0 There are Kurdish security forces that are seeking to dislodge that siege there at Sinjar Mountain.\xc2\xa0 And if American military assets can be helpful in supporting Kurdish forces, then airstrikes could be carried out in pursuit of that goal.</p>\n<p>The third is slightly broader, but is related to our belief and commitment to supporting integrated Iraqi security forces and Kurdish security forces as they unite the country to repel the threat that is posed by the ISIL advance.\xc2\xa0 What will be required for that, of course, is an integrated, inclusive political leadership in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And it is why this country stands ready to support the formation of an inclusive government in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There has been significant progress on that front in the last few weeks.\xc2\xa0 There has been the appointment of a President, a speaker and two deputy speakers that reflect the diversity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s population.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The head of government in Iraq, however, is the prime minister, and the prime minister has not yet been selected.\xc2\xa0 That will be the responsibility of the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 Once that government has formed, we would anticipate, and we will certainly be continuing to urge that government to pursue an inclusive governing agenda so they can unite the country to confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the United States stands ready to support the formation of that government and that government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to repel the advance of ISIL, and that includes, where necessary, the deployment of military force; it will not include, however, the additional American combat troops being deployed to Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the humanitarian situation, is there a plan to get those people off of the mountain?\xc2\xa0 And would there be a role for the U.S. in any such operation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What is being -- the strategy right now is to try to meet the basic and immediate humanitarian needs of those who are trapped in these pretty terrible conditions.\xc2\xa0 That is what prompted the airdrop of supplies that occurred overnight.\xc2\xa0 The second prong in that strategy, as the President described it in his remarks last night, is the possibility of targeted military strikes that could dislodge the ISIL forces that are carrying out the siege of the mountain.\xc2\xa0 That would be in support of Kurdish security forces that are also trying to disrupt that siege.\xc2\xa0 So we will be acting in support of Kurdish forces who are trying to free those who are trapped at the top of the mountain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, this is -- what is not contemplated here is the introduction of American troops in a combat role to alleviate this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement on this has been today?\xc2\xa0 We know about the phone call with Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s King Abdullah.\xc2\xa0 Has he been in meetings?\xc2\xa0 Is he on the phone with other leaders trying to get allies to join this campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out any additional presidential phone calls right now.\xc2\xa0 If the President places additional phone calls that we can read out, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do that in a timely fashion today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has met with members of his national security team to get an overnight update about the situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He was, of course, as you would expect, briefed on the military strike that was carried out this morning, East Coast time.\xc2\xa0 And the President will stay in close touch with his national security team over the course of the day so that he can be updated as necessary.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the ISIS -- or ISIL make gains in recent weeks, the United States has sent military advisers, and the President last night took the action that he took.\xc2\xa0 You and he have said that there\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution to this and that the United States should not get dragged into a war.\xc2\xa0 What is to stop that from happening?\xc2\xa0 And what is to stop the Islamic State forces from advancing further into Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to take that.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a couple of different questions, so let me try and take those individually.</p>\n<p>The first one -- and this is I think in some ways is the most important thing for the American people to understand, that the President said this very clearly in his remarks last night; in fact, I have them here.\xc2\xa0 So let me just -- if you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me for a second, I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat them.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cAs Commander-in-Chief,\xe2\x80\x9d the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And so even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So that is a pretty clear expression from the Commander-in-Chief about what our intentions are and what the limit of any sort of military action would be.\xc2\xa0 And that is a clear enunciation of the kind of principle that\xe2\x80\x99s at stake here, which is this belief that there are many challenges facing the people of Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President that those challenges cannot be solved by the American military; they can only be solved through an inclusive government of the people of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress in trying to form that government, and we are hopeful that once that government is formed, that they will pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s required to unite that country in the face of the threat that exists in that country right now.</p>\n<p>If there is a role for the American military to play in supporting the Iraqi people and that inclusive government and an integrated security force that is capable of defending the country, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll use that American military prowess in pursuit of that goal as well.\xc2\xa0 It is, after all, in the clear national security interest of the United States for there to be a stable Iraqi government that can preside over a stable Iraq, and a security force that has the necessary capability to address the security situation in that country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are all difficult challenges, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to minimize them, but we have a very clear point of view that\xe2\x80\x99s based on our recent experience about the limits of American involvement in that kind of endeavor.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is this is a situation that is a very difficult challenge, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a challenge that can be solved by the American military.\xc2\xa0 There is support that can be provided by the American military, but this is a situation that will only be solved by the Iraqi people and a government that reflects the views of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief or hope that the actions that he authorized yesterday effectively will buy time so that the Iraqis will be able to organize their government and their defense forces to repel ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would describe it that way and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President did either.\xc2\xa0 Again, what I would do is -- the primary goal of the mission that the President authorized last night was the protection of American personnel who are in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President authorized military action to try to address an urgent, even dire, humanitarian situation on Sinjar Mountain, and more generally, a willingness on the part of the American people to continue to stand with the people of Iraq as they pursue a future that is reflective of the diverse population of the nation of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that future is under grave threat by ISIL extremists who are making advances across that country.\xc2\xa0 And our desire -- and it is in the clear interest of American national security for us to support the Iraqi people as they confront that threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, this is a threat that we cannot confront for them; it is a threat that can only be met and defeated by a unified Iraq in support of an integrated, capable Iraq security force.\xc2\xa0 If that requires the support of the American military, that is support that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to offer.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll not offer it in the form of a prolonged military conflict that involves the United States of America, and it will not involve American troops returning to Iraq in a combat role.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just ask a question about immigration as well.\xc2\xa0 Border patrol data show a decline in the number of children being apprehended for crossing the border illegally, and adults as well.\xc2\xa0 How does that data factor into the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, his urgency in acting unilaterally to address the immigration situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things about the data, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s views.</p>\n<p>The first thing about the data that\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand is we have seen a downward trend over the last four to six weeks of the rate at which unaccompanied children are being apprehended at the border.\xc2\xa0 However, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that compared to a year ago or even two years ago, there still is -- there are still apprehensions taking place at an elevated rate.\xc2\xa0 So while they have come down from the peak that we all saw earlier this summer, the rate is still high when you compare it to broader historical trends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing -- the second point that I wanted to make on this -- that historical trends also indicate that as the weather cools and as we enter the fall and winter season, traditionally the rates of apprehensions, the rates of those who attempt to illegally enter the country go back up.\xc2\xa0 And the volatility in these numbers is something that the administration remains concerned about, and it is why we have taken some steps within the executive branch to reprogram some funds and to devote additional resources to the border; that even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a decline in the rate, we want to make sure that the resources are necessary if and when volatility is reintroduced into that situation and the numbers start to go back up.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that we are ahead of the curve on that.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also why we continue to urge Congress to take action to provide additional resources to ensure the federal government has the necessary resources to deal with that problem.\xc2\xa0 Congress left town for their August recess without acting on the specific request that was forwarded by this administration for additional resources, but we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that when they return they will take steps to provide those resources.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to acting unilaterally to address the problems of our broken immigration system, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure -- and House Republicans failure in particular -- to take action on a common-sense proposal to address a problem that we all know exists is evidence of how poorly Congress has performed in trying to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 And because Congress has failed to act, the President is going to use the power that\xe2\x80\x99s vested within the executive branch to try to take some steps that will address this problem.\xc2\xa0 Again, those steps will not be as robust or as impactful or as long lasting as the enactment of legislation, but there may be some things that the President can do, using his executive authority within the confines of the law, to address the problem.\xc2\xa0 And if there are, the President will not hesitate to act on them.</p>\n<p>The final thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this is that immigration over the course of, let\xe2\x80\x99s say the last couple of years, in terms of our political debate, was something that was talked about quite a bit, and was -- the need to reform the system was a view that was held pretty intensely by certain segments of the population.\xc2\xa0 But I think many Americans consider this to be something less than a top priority item.</p>\n<p>The President considered it to be a high priority because of the benefit -- the economic benefits that exist and the potential for addressing some of these problems in a common-sense way was great.\xc2\xa0 There was an important piece of bipartisan legislation that was passed through the Senate to address some of these problems.</p>\n<p>As a result of the media attention around the more recent problems at the border, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- and I think some of the public polling that your new organizations have done on this issue indicates that there is broader awareness among the American electorate that this is a significant problem.\xc2\xa0 That also means there\xe2\x80\x99s broader awareness among the American electorate that Congress has done nothing to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s broader awareness among the American electorate that congressional Republicans have been actively blocking efforts to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>So that only strengthens the hand of the President to make the kinds of decisions that are necessary, again, within the confines of the law, to take executive action to try to solve some of these problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, President Obama is now the fourth U.S. President in a row to engage in military action in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He ran for President on a platform of ending the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Was he reluctant to make this decision?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think the President was determined to use military action to protect American personnel who are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He was determined to use American military assets to try to address an urgent humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 And the President is just as determined to make sure that the United States is not dragged back into a prolonged military conflict in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there a part of him, though, that just thought, given the fact that he had ended the war in Iraq, that maybe this might not be a good idea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President, on numerous occasions, has amply demonstrated his commitment to using American military might to protect American people all around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That was evident last night; that\xe2\x80\x99s been evident in other situations, as well.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>But what\xe2\x80\x99s also evident is the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to ensure that the United States is not dragged back into a prolonged military conflict in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you about something that he said back in January when he told The New Yorker -- when assessing the ISIS threat, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe analogy we use around here sometimes -- and I think is accurate -- is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make them Kobe Bryant.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to say that ISIS, they\xe2\x80\x99re no longer the JVs?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is appropriate to say is that there is no question that the Laker uniforms that were worn, to use that analogy a little -- to draw out that analogy a little bit, that were worn by the al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan has been decimated and defeated in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about that.\xc2\xa0 And that is the result of the many decisions that were made by the President and the courageous service of our men and women in uniform and our men and women in the intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>What is also true is that there are other organizations that subscribe to the violent extremist ideology that\xe2\x80\x99s espoused and promulgated by al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Many of those groups in nations across the globe are not particularly sophisticated, are focused on local sectarian conflicts that don\xe2\x80\x99t pose a significant or immediate threat to U.S. interests or the U.S. homeland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think ISIS is a --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.\xc2\xa0 There are of course a couple of other organizations that do pose a more substantial threat to the United States and our interests.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of them.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the United States, in concert with our allies and partners, take significant steps, important steps to mitigate the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by those organizations that do have designs and some capability to try to strike the United States, and in some cases, even try to strike the homeland.</p>\n<p>We do remain concerned about the military proficiency that\xe2\x80\x99s been demonstrated by ISIL, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President take steps, including the authorization of military force, that would protect American citizens who might be harmed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly, ultimately, is it up to the Iraqis to eradicate the ISIS threat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Iraqi people, the Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi government to address the security situation in their country.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about what will be required here.\xc2\xa0 There will be American support that\xe2\x80\x99s provide, but there will not be American troops returning to Iraq in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 The President is determined to ensure that the United States will not be dragged back into a prolonged military conflict there.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, the challenges that face the nation of Iraq right now are the kinds of challenges that can only be solved by the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The first is trying to get you to flesh out the comparative rationale between military strikes here and no military strikes in Syria for humanitarian purposes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of differences -- well, there are more than a couple of differences between the situation in Syria and the situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Let me highlight a couple of the most important ones that might illustrate the kind of things that are driving the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making in these instances.</p>\n<p>First, and importantly, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 military involvement in Iraq was at the invitation of the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 That is obviously an important distinction between the relationship -- to the extent that there is one -- between the United States and the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 The second thing is, the United States has in Iraq -- and this is something that we have talked about previously -- significant intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance resources in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That ensures that American decision-makers, the American military and American intelligence officers have pretty good visibility into the situation on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of assets, and that kind of intelligence to that extent does not exist as it relates to the situation in Syria.</p>\n<p>A consequence of those intelligence efforts that have been underway in Iraq for some time is that we have enhanced military capabilities in Iraq; that using that intelligence and using the partnership that exists between the United States, Kurdish security forces and Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 There is more capability for us to take the kinds of steps that would be beneficial to the security situation in that country.</p>\n<p>So this highlights the need for people who are trying to make decisions about confronting these situations to consider each of them on a case-by-case basis; that while there are lessons that can be drawn from our involvement in other places, there is no direct correlation between action in one place and action in another in terms of guiding the decisions that are made solely by the consequences for American national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House continues to get criticism over not having a signed SOFA.\xc2\xa0 A lot of your critics say that if there was a remnant of American troops, ISIS would not have gotten this big and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come to this point.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have heard that argument made by some.\xc2\xa0 The argument that those individuals are making is that the situation might be different if there were still tens of thousands of American troops in a combat role in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The consequence of that sort of military posture is that right now American servicemen and women would be on the front lines fighting ISIL in cities and towns all across Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that that would be in the national security interests of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that that would be in the best interests of the United States military.\xc2\xa0 And there is a fundamental disagreement about that.</p>\n<p>However, I would submit that I think the vast majority of the American public would be on the side of the President in reaching the conclusion that the situation in Iraq is a situation that is best resolved by the Iraqi people, by an inclusive Iraqi government, and by a capable Iraq security force that has the ability to represent and protect the interests of every citizen in Iraq.</p>\n<p>And the United States can be in a position to offer support, military and otherwise, to the Iraqi government and to the Iraqi security forces as they carry out that effort.\xc2\xa0 But the President does not believe it would be in the interest of the United States of America for tens of thousands of American combat troops to be on the ground in Iraq fighting ISIL right now.\xc2\xa0 And that is just an honest disagreement that exists between the President and some of his critics on Capitol Hill, many of whom are in the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What about less than that?\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s been this -- the argument is \xe2\x80\x9ca remnant.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So not tens of thousands, less than 10,000 type of troop levels that we left in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, even if -- so, say you had thousands of American troops on the ground in Iraq, they would still be in a position where they would be on the frontlines fighting ISIL trying to protect Iraqi towns and cities.\xc2\xa0 And the President does not believe that that would be in the interests of American national security.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how was the invitation to intervene in Iraq conveyed to the U.S., and by whom?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was conveyed by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to the American political leadership.\xc2\xa0 In terms of what that conversation was like, or who was on either end of that conversation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But that is an invitation that they have -- that the Iraqi political leadership has talked about publicly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how -- when it was conveyed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if Iraq is the subject of the weekly address tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has taped the weekly address, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if that is the topic.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had two on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The first was, the State Department said that there was a meeting here at the White House earlier today to kind of coordinate regional partners and allies that might be interested in helping with ammunition or aide supplies.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if part of those conversations with allies is included bringing them in for military operations in Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would actually refer you to the Department of Defense on that matter.\xc2\xa0 But let me say a couple of other things about that that might be instructive for you.\xc2\xa0 The first is that there are these joint operation centers that exist in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 These are operation centers that include American military personnel, officials from Kurdish security forces, and personnel from Iraq security forces.\xc2\xa0 Those JOCs, as the military calls them, are up and running both in Erbil and in Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 And they are important to coordinating the efforts of all those who are involved right now on the ground.</p>\n<p>Through those joint operation centers, for example, these Iraqi security forces have been able to deploy assets in support of Kurdish security forces that are operating on the ground.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been a pretty effective tactic so far and something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult with them about.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, other partners in the region that the United States has worked with on a variety of issues to try to confront this and other challenges and the broader instability in the region.\xc2\xa0 Those are nations like Jordan; the President spoke to the King just this morning.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly will be in touch with them as we confront the ongoing situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also true of nations like Turkey and the UAE.\xc2\xa0 There also are other NATO allies of the United States that are concerned and have made public their concerns both about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the broader security situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult with them in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want them to lend a hand militarily?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys are interested in?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult and cooperate with them.\xc2\xa0 And if we have any specific asks to make of them, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll make those to them directly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I just wanted to ask about House Speaker John Boehner commenting on the strikes today.\xc2\xa0 He said that he was dismayed, and accused the President of, for political reasons, kind of refusing to reengage concretely on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what your reaction to that is.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Speaker might be one of those individuals who suggest that it would be in the core interest of American national security for there to be thousands or even tens of thousands of American troops to be on the frontlines in Iraq fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow him to state his own position if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, there\xe2\x80\x99s just an honest disagreement between the President and the Speaker of the House on that specific issue.</p>\n<p>I would point out that there has been extensive consultation between the President and leaders in Congress in confronting this issue.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me for a minute, I\xe2\x80\x99ll review some of the highlights of that consultation.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just eight days ago the President convened a meeting here at the White House with the congressional leadership to talk about this issue.\xc2\xa0 This was the congressional leadership in both houses, in both parties.\xc2\xa0 It also included members of relevant committees, national security committees on this topic.\xc2\xa0 That was a follow-up to a meeting that the President convened back in mid-June a couple of months ago, with the four leaders of the House and Senate, the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>In advance of the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement last night and his official announcement of an authorization to use military force in Iraq, there were a number of phone calls that were made from senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team to members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 This included the bipartisan leaders of both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It also included the chair and ranking member of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, the House and Senate Armed Service Committees, the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, and to even some members of the Appropriations Committee in both the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>So there has been a genuine and sincere effort on the part of this administration to closely consult with members of Congress on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the partnership and support of those members of Congress as we confront these very difficult challenges.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that there were statements that were issued by Democrats and Republicans that were complimentary of the decision that the President announced last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just really quickly, does talking to Appropriations suggest that you guys are going to seek any additional emergency appropriations from Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.\xc2\xa0 But it does indicate a sincere commitment to coordinate closely with the relevant officials on the Appropriations Committee.\xc2\xa0 So should that need arise in the future, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have keen understanding as to why that request is necessary.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 One, can you talk in as much detail as you can about the specific things that happened that President Obama was told that triggered this intervention?\xc2\xa0 Were there particular things on the ground?\xc2\xa0 Was it a particular movement of ISIL in a particular place?\xc2\xa0 And when was he told those things?\xc2\xa0 Can you kind of walk us through that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then second, follow up I guess on the last question -- a lot of the reaction from the Hill, while there have been statements from Republicans, yes, we think this is a good idea, most of those statements have said it\xe2\x80\x99s too late -- I mean, it should have been done sooner, and they encourage it to be more -- in the words of Mr. McCarthy, a \xe2\x80\x9cmore fulsome\xe2\x80\x9d and a broader, more comprehensive plan than has been put forward.\xc2\xa0 So are there efforts that are going to be underway to kind of lay out what the kind of longer-term strategy of this is at some point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that Mr. McCarthy may be in the category of individuals whose view was raised by Jessica earlier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I mean, he may, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not saying he wanted tens of thousands of boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But there are lots of people out there who are saying the very limited sort of targets that you guys are talking about should be broadened.\xc2\xa0 And is there some reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And then the tick-tock --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I only raise to note that it seems likely, even, that Mr. McCarthy may just have a difference of opinion with the President about what our core national security interests are in Iraq and how they\xe2\x80\x99re best served.\xc2\xa0 And that difference of agreement will not inhibit our commitment to coordinating and consulting with Mr. McCarthy and his colleagues in the Congress as we move forward in Iraq.</p>\n<p>But make no mistake that the decisions that are made in Iraq, in consultation with Congress, will be decided or guided by the President\xe2\x80\x99s views about the equities relating to American national security.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our view, again, that the protection of American personnel in Iraq is of paramount concern, and there is a stated willingness on the part of the President to act militarily in support of a unified Iraqi government and a more capable and integrated Iraq security force.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, as it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s briefings, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to talk in a lot of detail about those from here.\xc2\xa0 The President did receive a number of updates from members of his national security team over the course of the day yesterday.\xc2\xa0 This included Department of Defense personnel.\xc2\xa0 Many of you saw the photo that was put out by the White House late in the day yesterday that showed the President in the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about earlier.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about what was it in the last week or two that led the President to decide after weeks and months of holding back on airstrikes, what was it specifically that sort of triggered in him the decision that, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to move in this direction?\xc2\xa0 This didn\xe2\x80\x99t all happen -- or did it happen all yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there are three things that I can cite for you, probably not in the detail you would like.\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional detail we can provide, then maybe we can follow up with you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there are three things that come to mind here.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the urgent reports that we were seeing out of Sinjar Mountain about the dire and deteriorating humanitarian situation in that region of the country, those reports were deeply disturbing and certainly influenced the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take military action in support of a humanitarian mission there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And those came in --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Over the course of this week -- that we saw those reports over the course of this week.</p>\n<p>The second thing that I would note is there were reports of -- and many of these were public reports -- of advances that ISIL was staging in the direction of Erbil.\xc2\xa0 And there was concern about the safety and security of American personnel who are in Erbil.\xc2\xa0 And that also led to the President\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a more robust military action could be required to ensure the safety and security of those American officials in Erbil.</p>\n<p>The third thing I would note -- and this is also an important part of this, and this relates a principle that the President first discussed back in mid-June when there were reports of the significant advances that ISIL had made sort of the first time around here, and that relates to the progress that the Iraqis have made in forming their government.\xc2\xa0 That it was only in the last few weeks that we have seen Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership take the necessary steps to appoint a speaker who was Sunni, and to appoint deputy speakers, one of whom was a Kurd and the other who was Shia, the appointment of a Kurdish president and progress toward eventually appointing a prime minister who would lead the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so the success that they have -- or I should say, at least the progress that they have made in forming that government, in line with the procedures laid out in the Iraqi constitution, was a source of some encouragement that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership was prepared to pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that will be required to unite the country.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that remains to be done on that effort, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to urge them to make that kind of progress.</p>\n<p>The Vice President, as you know, has been on the phone frequently over the last several weeks, in touch with members of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership on this issue.\xc2\xa0 You know that he was in touch with President Barzani in the last day or two to discuss some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 So he obviously has played a very important role in both urging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue the kind of governing agenda that we believe is necessary, but also closely coordinating with them in terms of their assessment of the situation on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional detail you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you follow up.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in terms of this authorization for airstrikes, is it open-ended in terms of time, or is there an end date?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has not laid out a specific end date.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to sort of take this approach in which those kinds of decisions are evaluated regularly and are driven by the security situation on the ground, both as it relates to the safety and security of American personnel, but also as it relates to supporting the ongoing efforts of both Kurdish security forces and Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when the President comes back from Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard for those two days, are those meetings going to be related to this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting schedule when he does return.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he does have conversations on this topic when he is back in the White House, not next week, but the week after.\xc2\xa0 But again, the President had planned to return to the White House before this recent announcement.\xc2\xa0 So there are other meetings in the schedule, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this had nothing to do with those plans at all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did not.\xc2\xa0 It did not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Nothing to do?\xc2\xa0 And you said that a top priority is protecting Americans serving in Erbil and in Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 The President actually has said -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s called it two months ago that the top priority is protecting Americans serving overseas.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then why not simply evacuate, so like he did in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Why not -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one way to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re okay and get them out of there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That certainly is an option.\xc2\xa0 However, there\xe2\x80\x99s very important work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done at the consulate in Erbil and at the joint operations center that I mentioned earlier in Erbil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that work a higher priority?\xc2\xa0 Because the President said the top priority is protecting Americans over there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And if we are in a position where we can conduct the kind of military action that will protect Americans but allow them to do the very important work that is currently underway in Erbil, then that\xe2\x80\x99s what we would like to do.\xc2\xa0 And that is the -- again, that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any discussion of a drawdown of personnel -- diplomatic personnel at the consulate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but you can check with the Department of State about our posture when it comes to our personnel in the consulate in Erbil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the humanitarian effort here, given that 200,000 or so have been killed in Syria, more than 2 million forced from their homes, how did that not rise to the level of a humanitarian intervention, but this with a significantly smaller number of people involved did?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there has been a significant humanitarian intervention in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about a military intervention.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s my point -- but it was not a military intervention.\xc2\xa0 That the United States remains the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to Syria and to Syrian refugees who have fled to other countries to escape violence in that country.\xc2\xa0 There has been significant resources that have been dedicated to trying to build up the moderate opposition in Syria to try to counter the threat, both that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by the some of the extremist opposition groups in Syria, but also to withstand the assault from the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the response in Syria has been very robust, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the situation on the ground in both Iraq and Syria is different, and that has consequences for the kinds of military capabilities and risks that are associated with different responses.</p>\n<p>So the President is constantly evaluating both of these situation to determine what is in the best interest of American national security, and that is what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s making in both countries.</p>\n<p>Sam, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you told Jonathan there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific end date, but earlier you mentioned that our military engagement will not be prolonged.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can give us what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cprolonged\xe2\x80\x9d is.\xc2\xa0 And I have a follow-up question after that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer a specific fate from here.\xc2\xa0 But the President is determined -- the President ran for this office determined to try to wind down the conflict in Iraq responsibly and to bring servicemen and women home.\xc2\xa0 So the President has a long --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no end date, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be prolonged?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what the American people should expect in terms of engagement.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeframe you can give them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a timeframe that I can share right now, but there is -- there are two principles at stake here and you are insightful to notice the tension between the two.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, I appreciate that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It happens to be true, Sam, that there is a determination on the part of the President to use American military force to protect American personnel in Iraq to address the ongoing humanitarian situation there and to achieve a goal that is in the clear interest of American national security, which is a stable Iraqi government that is able to exercise some control over the security situation in that country.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s necessary because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a pretty volatile region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And trying to restore some stability to that country in that region is an important goal of American national security.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President is determined to ensure that the United States is not dragged back into a prolonged military conflict in Iraq.</p>\n<p>One way that we can prevent that from occurring is to not return combat troops to -- or American troops in a combat role to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that the President has made very clear, and that is a principle that will also apply in this situation.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer up a specific date, but I am able to offer a specific presidential commitment that a prolonged military conflict that includes U.S. involvement is not on the table here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My follow-up question was -- I just wanted to get your reaction to the other side of the criticism, or point, I should say.\xc2\xa0 In Peter Baker\xe2\x80\x99s piece today, Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies said the following -- I\xe2\x80\x99d like your reaction to it:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot bomb Islamist extremists into submission or disappearance.\xc2\xa0 Every bomb recruits more supporters.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is she right?\xc2\xa0 Is she wrong?\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I read earlier a statement from the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks last night, and there is a key phrase that I truncated for the sake of efficiency.\xc2\xa0 In light of your question, I should not have cut off because it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 The President said, \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where I ended.\xc2\xa0 He continued to say, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause there\xe2\x80\x99s no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that the President believes in a principle that I spent some time articulating yesterday, which is that there is no military solution to the underlying problems in Iraq, there\xe2\x80\x99s only an Iraqi political solution.</p>\n<p>And so our efforts -- including our military efforts -- are in support of an inclusive Iraqi government that can bring some stability and security back to the people of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 It will require them to govern in a way that inspires the confidence of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population that the government is looking out for their interests and their security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me rephrase that.\xc2\xa0 I guess her point is that bombing, the use of military force even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ground, has the potential to be counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 Is that concern at all shared in this administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, of course that is something that is considered, but there are these other principles that are at stake in terms of the protection of American personnel and addressing humanitarian situations and supporting the formation of an inclusive Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 These are difficult equities to balance.\xc2\xa0 But the President I think has been pretty clear about what he thinks is the best way for us to balance those equities in a way that maximizes the benefits for American national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up, please?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Tamara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to get you to clarify something that you talked about, which -- you talked about the need for a political solution and you said that if the Iraqi government forms an inclusive government, that -- it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there could be more military involvement, and I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping you can expand on that.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that there would be a broader mission of airstrikes?\xc2\xa0 What are you saying happens if their government forms in a way that is satisfactory to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are the kinds of decisions that will be made by the President, again, based on conditions on the ground, based on the capability of the American military, and based on the kinds of decisions that are made by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also be evaluating the capability and integration of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be testing the degree to which they\xe2\x80\x99re able to coordinate with Kurdish security forces to confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also be monitoring what sort of condition ISIL is in, and whether or not they continue to have capacity and capability to destabilize the security situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of factors at play here.\xc2\xa0 Despite all those factors, there\xe2\x80\x99s one sort of underlying principle, which is that this is a situation that we cannot solve for the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 This is a situation that the Iraqi people must solve for themselves.\xc2\xa0 The United States stands prepared to stand with them as they confront this very difficult challenge, but ultimately, it will be the -- responsible of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s government and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to confront this threat.</p>\n<p>Now, as they confront that threat, if military assistance from the United States is necessary, the President will evaluate that request, will evaluate conditions on the ground and some of the other things I just mentioned to determine what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of American national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What will not occur is the United States will not be dragged back into a prolonged military conflict in Iraq, and the President will not send American troops in a combat role back to Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re not closing the door to somewhat of a broader mission -- broader than defending the mountain and -- which is not the proper terminology, but --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understood what you said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- broader than that or defending U.S. personnel.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like it is potentially broader depending on the political situation.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President indicated in his remarks last night, and even indicated six or eight weeks ago when he first spoke on this topic, a willingness to use military action in support of an inclusive Iraqi government that is successfully inspiring the confidence of the American -- of the Iraqi public and representing the interests of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.</p>\n<p>There is a longstanding military-to-military relationship that exists between the United States and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There are longstanding political ties between the American government and the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is committed to standing with our partners in Iraq as they confront some of these threats.\xc2\xa0 There are some limits, however, and those limits are rooted in the fact that these are only challenges that can be solved by the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to follow up.\xc2\xa0 The President said in 2011 when he brought home all U.S. troops, Iraq is not a perfect place, but we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving behind \xe2\x80\x9ca sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why did that turn out to be so wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what happened, Ed, is we saw that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s government pursued an agenda that was not inclusive; that it did not succeed in unifying that country, it did not succeed in even unifying Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces.\xc2\xa0 And that meant that Iraq was not able to withstand the pressure and eventually an assault from ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is why the President, for a number of months now, has been urging -- well, the truth is, he\xe2\x80\x99s been urging this for longer than a number of months, even years, encouraging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that would unify the country to make it more strong, more stable and better able to confront the threats that are posed by these extremist groups like ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So if that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened before, what is the strategy now?\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner, something else he said in his statement was, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dismayed by the ongoing absence of a strategy for countering the grave threat ISIS poses to the region.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So just a direct question:\xc2\xa0 What is the strategy to stop ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The strategy is related to ensuring that they cannot use instability in Iraq as a base of operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they are today, so how do you stop them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And so what the United States is doing is we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a couple of different things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, we are taking the kind of action that will ensure close coordination between Kurdish security forces, Iraqi security forces and American military forces to confront ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President announced a number of weeks ago that he was sending an assessment team to go into Iraq -- these are military advisers -- who can assess the situation on the ground, who can assess the capability of ISIL, who can assess the capability of Iraq and Kurdish security forces, and offer some advice as they confront this challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has also signaled a willingness that if Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders are willing to take the necessary steps to unify the country to face the threat that the American military can come in behind and offer support to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to confront the threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But with al Qaeda, the goal has been defeat and decimate core al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Is the goal to defeat and decimate ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the goal as it relates to this very specific situation is the need for Iraq to confront the threat that is posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The difference is -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s walk through this, because this is important -- core al Qaeda was operating with virtual impunity in the area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and they were able to set up a terror network around the globe, a pretty sophisticated command and control structure, that allowed the core al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan to order -- to organize, order and carry out catastrophic attacks against the U.S. homeland.</p>\n<p>The situation with ISIL, while dangerous, is different, and it is why it is so important for Iraq, with the support of the United States, to confront the threat that ISIL currently poses to the stability of Iraq and to populations, including some minority populations that right now are being persecuted by ISIL in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that is what accounts for the different approach in dealing with these two situations, but both the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed -- well, let me say it this way -- the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL is still one that the President takes very seriously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They have demonstrated a pretty sophisticated military capability in the last few weeks in terms of the success that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in advancing in Iraq, even in the face of some opposition from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces and Kurdish security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that ISIS can\xe2\x80\x99t today perhaps launch terror attacks against the United States, the key difference from al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But Secretary of State John Kerry a short time ago in Afghanistan had a news conference where he was saying that the President believes ISIS is a threat in the region and could be a long-term threat to U.S. security.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a fear at least that they could be a long-term threat.\xc2\xa0 Why is the goal not to defeat and decimate them?\xc2\xa0 Why is it just to offer support to the Iraqi government, which you yourself says is in shambles?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I said that it was in shambles.\xc2\xa0 I actually think I noted the progress that they have made in terms of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think they can stop ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that they have made progress in putting together a unified Iraqi government that can successfully unify the country to confront the threat that is posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That is the key to defeating this threat and reducing the potential that ISIL can attack the United States or our interest and allies both in that region, but eventually around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw this VICE News documentary that -- where ISIS officials were quoted as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will humiliate them everywhere, God-willing, and we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How do you react when a group like that makes a claim of threat like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those comments.\xc2\xa0 I think the President spoke pretty forcefully about the United States\xe2\x80\x99 resolve and commitment and willingness to use military force to support the efforts of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to defeat ISIL and prevent them from using Iraq as a base of operations, but also to ensure that we can restore or at least strengthen the security situation in Iraq and that we can prevent the ISIL terrorists from terrorizing minority populations in Iraq.</p>\n<p>We have been, as I mentioned yesterday, deeply disturbed by reports that there are Christian villages that are being decimated violently by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we have talked quite a bit about the plight of the Yezidi population, thousands of whom are trapped on this mountain.\xc2\xa0 So there are a wide range of actions that have been perpetrated by ISIL that are of deep concern to the United States, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why you are seeing the kind of reaction that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the President and the United States military.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Some military analysts have described the initial airstrikes as warning shots.\xc2\xa0 Is that how you would characterize the airstrikes that were dropped today?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us what the actual impact of those airstrikes were?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think warning shots -- the description of them as warning shots goes to how they will be interpreted by someone else.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to.\xc2\xa0 What I can speak to is the stated goal of that military action as described by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And that specifically was to take out a military asset operated by ISIL that was threatening a city where American personnel were located.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why that strike was authorized by the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any indication that it has slowed their advance to Erbil?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer an updated, on-the-ground assessment of the situation -- of the security situation in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the question of what next steps the President might be considering, would he consider arming the Peshmerga forces?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, we have a strong military-to-military relationship with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces.\xc2\xa0 And the Iraqi security forces have shared some of those assets with Kurdish security forces.\xc2\xa0 We have also demonstrated a willingness and are carrying out efforts to increase the flow of supplies, including arms, to Kurdish security forces as they confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These joint operation centers that exist in Erbil and Baghdad have been very helpful in coordinating the activities of the militaries that are acting there.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, we have been pleased and continue to encourage efforts to integrate Iraqi air assets with the ground offensives of the Kurdish security forces.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of integration and cooperation will be critical to their success.\xc2\xa0 But to the extent that the Kurdish security forces themselves need additional resources, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to increase the flow of those resources, including arms, from the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, what can you tell us about the FAA saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s prohibited U.S. Airlines and other commercial carriers from flying over Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more information about that?\xc2\xa0 How long can we expect that to last?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer up any additional information about that.\xc2\xa0 You should check with the FAA.\xc2\xa0 They make those kinds of decisions independently and based solely on the safety of the traveling public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to try one more on Syria.\xc2\xa0 The President last night, in addition to saying that there was a government mandate from Iraq, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is he satisfied that he\xe2\x80\x99s done enough to prevent that massacre that seems to be ongoing there?\xc2\xa0 More than 170,000 people have been killed so far.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating two things, right.\xc2\xa0 He was talking about the urgent humanitarian situation on Sinjar Mountain, but you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there not an urgent humanitarian crisis in Syria as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course there is, and that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a strong response from the United States to provide the largest -- the United States is the largest donor of bilateral assistance to Syrian refugees and those who are fleeing violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the United States government closely coordinate with international aid organizations, including the U.N. and the governments that are housing those refugees right now.\xc2\xa0 There are large refugee populations in Turkey and in Jordan, in particular.\xc2\xa0 The United States has provided assistance to those two countries as they have tried to meet the basic humanitarian needs of those who are fleeing violence in Syria.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the United States take aggressive action to support the efforts of the moderate opposition, to withstand the assault from the Assad regime, and in some cases even to counter that assault.\xc2\xa0 So the United States is invested and is working to try to meet the urgent humanitarian situation in Syria as well.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned to Jessica earlier, the situation on the ground in Iraq is different from the situation in Syria and it merits different responses from the United States when you\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions that are focused on the best core national security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 But the massacre seems to be ongoing, on a daily basis people continuing to be slaughtered there.\xc2\xa0 So the question is, has he done enough?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is a tragic situation, and it is why our efforts continue in that country to try to bring an end to that suffering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to Iraq in a minute, but a couple of other things have happened on the world stage I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your reaction to.\xc2\xa0 First, the agreement to form a unity government in Afghanistan and the restarting of violence in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 I imagine the President has thoughts on both.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your reaction.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as it relates to Afghanistan, the Secretary of State was obviously in Afghanistan over the last day or two to try to broker an agreement between the two presidential candidates there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you went there with this goal, to achieve a unity government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what they have described as -- he went there with the goal to try to broker a political solution to that electoral dispute.\xc2\xa0 And that was centered on ensuring that both candidates remained engaged in the effort to count all of the ballots and inspire some confidence in the electoral outcome of that contest.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s important because it will inspire confidence among the Afghan people in their democratic institutions, and that will increase and strengthen the mandate of the eventual winner of that contest.\xc2\xa0 And that was the goal of the Secretary of State to continue to encourage and support the transition of power in Afghanistan from President Karzai to the next president that will be democratically elected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the resumption of violence in the Middle East, to whom do you ascribe the blame and what is the next step?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The United States is very concerned about today\xe2\x80\x99s developments in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 We condemn the renewed rocket fire and are concerned about the safety and security of civilians on both sides of that conflict.\xc2\xa0 We call on all sides to cease hostilities immediately and resume cease-fire negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to urge all parties to do all they can to protect the lives of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Israel has agreed to extend the negotiations, but Hamas refused without Israel meeting a list of their demands.\xc2\xa0 Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s decision to resume rocket fire will not only put the people of Israel and of Gaza at greater risk, it will do nothing to meet the expectations of the Palestinian people.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope that the parties will agree to an extension of the cease-fire in the coming hours and ultimately conclude an agreement to cement a sustainable cease-fire.</p>\n<p>As you know, there are Americans who are in Cairo who are participating in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And we are urging both sides to try to put in place a sustainable cease-fire agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 U.S. negotiators believe that the requests from Hamas weren\xe2\x80\x99t reasonable?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s something for them to be -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a question to be resolved at the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 We certainly do not believe that it was appropriate for Hamas to restart rocket fire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq -- just practically, simply -- how are the Yezidis going to get off Sinjar Mountain?\xc2\xa0 And what is the U.S. plan to do that, because there\xe2\x80\x99s scant worthiness to feed them and give them a little bit of water if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be slaughtered in four days as opposed to two.\xc2\xa0 How are they going to get off that mountain?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s in place that is related to, first, meeting their immediate basic humanitarian needs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the airdrop was.\xc2\xa0 That was the goal of the airdrop.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that only meant partially.\xc2\xa0 As the Pentagon disclosed, it\xe2\x80\x99s not feeding or giving water to everyone who is up there.\xc2\xa0 And so we would assume there will be more of those in the coming days.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As needed, the United States military stands ready to conduct additional operations to provide additional life-saving supplies to the individuals who are stuck at the top of the mountain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, separate from that the President has also ordered that military action could be used to try to end that siege.\xc2\xa0 Right now, there are Kurdish security forces that are operating in the region that are countering ISIL forces.\xc2\xa0 And if there is American military might that can be deployed to tip the balance in support of Kurdish forces that are operating on the ground, then we will certainly look for an opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the idea is to drive ISIL forces away through the air and then create a cordon that the Peshmerga would operate and evacuate those civilians?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Kurdish security forces, the Peshmerga, have been operating in this region for some time.\xc2\xa0 And if there is an opportunity to use military force in support of those ongoing ground operations, then the President has authorized the military to take that kind of action in the hope that the siege of that mountain would be ended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, in Erbil, the military strike today was to take out a piece of artillery that was firing on the Peshmerga.\xc2\xa0 It seems in both places the United States is offering air support for what it hopes will be a rejuvenated Kurdish Peshmerga force in both places.\xc2\xa0 Is that the overall strategy throughout the U.S. military interaction with ISIL -- rely on ground forces that are Peshmerga to retake land, retake places, retake facilities, dams, electrical plants lost to ISIL with the added benefit of air support, which is what will rejuvenate them and get them back in the field fighting more effectively than they have now?\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate description of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, I would say, yes.\xc2\xa0 But let me take a shot and see if I can describe what the strategy is here.\xc2\xa0 The first thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important is it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that we do have confidence in the Kurdish fighting forces, that we do assess that Kurdish fighting forces are demonstrating a willingness to fight, as evidenced by several attempted counterattacks against ISIL that have been launched over the last several days.</p>\n<p>It is true that in some locations, Kurdish forces have withdrawn in the face of better-equipped and more agile ISIL forces.\xc2\xa0 And while the Kurdish withdrawals appear to be orderly, they continue to face challenges about regrouping and redistributing their forces so that they\xe2\x80\x99re better positioned to blunt ISIL offenses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the Peshmerga, which is the other name for the Kurdish security forces, are a capable fighting force, and they continue to fight ISIL forces in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 What may be necessary in some situations is support from the American military to enhance their fighting position, or to take out key ISIL targets that would allow them to have some greater success.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, there are a couple of limiting factors here that are important.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to not send American troops back to Iraq in a combat role, and to ensure that this is being done in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s coordinated with the broader Iraqi security force and coordinate with an inclusive Iraq government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So the reason for the specificity of my question is that the Iraqi army is not currently relevant in this fight; the Peshmerga are, and the U.S. military assets from the air.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant right now.\xc2\xa0 And that seems to me to be a potential turning point, not only in dealing with ISIL, but in the future of Iraq -- because the fighters who are fighting right now to rid Iraq, in the northern part of Iraq, of ISIL are the Peshmerga.\xc2\xa0 And they may have an opportunity to regain facilities or things that are crucial for the long-term interests of all of Iraq, meaning the dam in Mosul, electrical production facilities, other things like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about is if the United States is going to say, well, no, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to help you with that even though it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future because it\xe2\x80\x99s not Mount Sinjar and it\xe2\x80\x99s not Erbil.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the overall interaction with the Peshmerga going to be if they do get back in the fight and start rolling ISIL back?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen that the Peshmerga are prepared to get back into the fight.\xc2\xa0 I first want to dispute a little bit the premise of your question as it relates to Iraq security forces.\xc2\xa0 We do believe there\xe2\x80\x99s an important role for them to play in this broader fight.\xc2\xa0 That is why Iraq security forces are included in the joint operating centers in Erbil and Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 It is why the United States continues to maintain the close military-to-military coordination that exists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the reason -- according to the assessment of our analysts, the reason that we saw a decline in the capability of Iraq security forces is that it was not integrated in a way that reflects Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.\xc2\xa0 And that is a consequence of failed political leadership -- that when you have a political leadership that is not demonstrating a commitment to an inclusive governing agenda, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact on their ability to command and control and integrated security force.</p>\n<p>So that is why this all starts with -- as difficult and challenging and occasionally frustrating as it is, this all starts with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership making the kinds of difficult decisions that are necessary to form an inclusive government and pursue the kind of agenda that will inspire the diverse population of Iraq and inspire the confidence of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population in their security forces.</p>\n<p>So if the people of Iraq are invested in the success of the government, it will make it easier for the security forces to also be integrated and united, and to better confront the advance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you and I would agree that\xe2\x80\x99s all over the (inaudible) stuff.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out -- Peshmerga asked for more help outside of Erbil or Mount Sinjar to accomplish military objectives that are relevant to pushing back ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Will they get the air assistance from the United States?\xc2\xa0 Yes or no?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is a decision that will be made on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 But we are closely coordinating with Peshmerga forces in a variety of settings.\xc2\xa0 We are increasing the flow of arms and assistance to the Peshmerga.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re closely coordinating our efforts in the context of these joint operation centers both in Erbil and Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of -- it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to generalize about that situation because these are decisions that are made on a case-by-case basis by the American military that knows this area of the world very well; by the assessment teams that are currently on the ground that the President sent there a few weeks ago; and by American officials who are evaluating these kinds of objectives through the lens of America\xe2\x80\x99s national security priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Lisa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President anticipate that developments in Iraq and the Middle East will cause him to change his vacation plans at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any changes in the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule to announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll still participate in that fundraiser on Monday?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for Monday hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed either.\xc2\xa0 But as we always say, the President will be traveling to Massachusetts with an array of communications equipment and national security advisors and other to ensure that he has the capacity to make the kinds of decisions that are required for the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for the President to return to the White House, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a long flight from Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard back to the Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s necessitating his need to return the following Monday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As we said earlier this week, the President did want to return to Washington for a day or two to meet in person with some White House staff for some -- for meetings.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out those meetings because they\xe2\x80\x99re still more than a week away.</p>\n<p>Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 The Islamic jihadists think that Jews and Christians are infidels who are being killed in the most terrible ways -- crucified, beheaded, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 How do you change attitudes like that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Connie, the United States stands as a beacon for freedom and respect for basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 That is what distinguishes the United States, and it\xe2\x80\x99s so critical to the founding values of this country.\xc2\xa0 And we have condemned in clear terms the efforts of extremist groups to target and in some cases massacre minority populations solely because of their religious or ethnic identity.\xc2\xa0 And you saw a willingness last night, from this President, to authorize military force to try to confront an urgent humanitarian situation that was predicated on the evil intentions of this extremist group.</p>\n<p>And the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to those kinds of values, and the bravery of our servicemen and women to take the kinds of actions that are necessary to try to prevent the situations from occurring, again, is inspiring and is something that speaks to the core American values that we hold so dear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you deal with people who have these attitudes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way that we deal with them I think is pretty evident based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong words and his willingness to take military action against them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, any update on the next Mr. Earnest?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No updates.</p>\n<p>Carrie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked a couple times about the difference between the situation in Iraq and Syria in terms of the response.\xc2\xa0 Just wondering, is it this an instance where Iraq -- this country has a certain special obligation to Iraq and circumstances on the ground in terms of personnel?\xc2\xa0 Like, can you just expand a little bit on that as to why the situation there is necessitating this response versus any sort of similar situation beyond Syria, just anywhere in the country in terms of -- or in the world in terms of what guides the humanitarian response from the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in terms of the core objectives and the core priorities, the President laid those out pretty clearly last night.\xc2\xa0 What is also true -- and I think this is what you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to, and if not, stop me -- but I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to is the significant investment and sacrifice that has already been made in Iraq by hundreds of thousands of American servicemen and women who have served that country.\xc2\xa0 They served in very difficult situations.\xc2\xa0 Many of them were injured and many of them died.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is evident -- or that is an indication of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s success.\xc2\xa0 We have -- that service was in support of the Iraqi people having access to the opportunity to determine the future of their country.\xc2\xa0 And we have been disappointed that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders have not seized that opportunity in the way that we believe is necessary for Iraq to remain the kind of secure, stable country that I think the vast majority of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population would like to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is why the United States does continue to urge Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to pursue a more inclusive governing agenda.\xc2\xa0 And it does speak to the commitment of the American people to stand alongside the people of Iraq, even in very difficult times, as they pursue and make the kinds of decisions that are required to ultimately achieve the future of their country that they would like to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is that special -- that is that history that plays a role here and makes this situation different than any number of humanitarian situations in the world?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s harder to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the history is pretty obvious.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s harder to assess is what consequence that has for our ongoing national security and how decisions are made about our ongoing national security.\xc2\xa0 So I readily acknowledge the history that you\xe2\x80\x99re highlighting, but in terms of what is driving the decision that the President has made to authorize some military action in Iraq, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to his remarks in terms of what those priorities were.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask you -- what role did the President\xe2\x80\x99s Atrocities Prevention Board play in the lead-up to this in terms of informing anything that he\xe2\x80\x99s done?\xc2\xa0 Did they have a role in any sort of way?\xc2\xa0 And they did a report last year that\xe2\x80\x99s remained classified, even though I think some other reports have been released -- can you speak to that at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to speak to the report.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.\xc2\xa0 But the establishment of that board I think is a testament to some of the principles that the President discussed last night, which is that the United States does remain a beacon of freedom and protection of basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 That certainly applies in this country, but it applies that principle to populations, including minority populations all around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That means that the United States stands squarely with those minority populations that are being targeted because of their religious or ethnic identity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we stand -- the American people stand with the Yezidis and the Christians in Iraq who are being persecuted by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to those kinds of issues and strong statements that indicate our support for those populations that are being persecuted is clear, and goes to a core value of what it means to be an American.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to anything -- any role they did play in the lead-up to making this decision to act as circumstance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific actions that are taken by the board, but we can look into that for you.\xc2\xa0 I just would say that the creation of the board is evidence of how deeply held the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are in this area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to follow up on what Tamara had asked you earlier.\xc2\xa0 You said that between June and now, the formation of a more inclusive government and progress thereof in Iraq was a source of encouragement.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to clarify -- between June and now, was the President\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to respond to the request conventional ever communicated as conditional to the Iraqi government on seeing that progress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was actually pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring his remarks with me.\xc2\xa0 I guess now I sort of regret not doing that.\xc2\xa0 But when the President spoke on this topic on June 13th, he delivered a short statement on the South Lawn prior to boarding Marine One.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of those comments -- and I think it might even have been in response to a question -- the President indicated that the key to solving Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s underlying problems and to stabilizing their security situation was the formation of a government that reflects Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.</p>\n<p>And the President was resolute about his commitment that the United States military would not be used to prop up an Iraqi government that didn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the diverse Iraqi population and the diversity of views of the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 So it was I think evident to anybody who was trying to divine the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities that a commitment to use military force could not be separated from the commitment of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to form the kind of inclusive government and pursue the kind of unified governing agenda that will be required to unite that country in the face of this existential threat from ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to follow up -- so separate and apart, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the President was responding in large measure to the humanitarian and genocidal situation, but you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that he would not have done that if the progress had not been seen -- that he had made clear he needed to see -- before the United States would step in militarily?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to evaluate that hypothetical situation.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, we have seen a slightly more optimistic scenario than the one that you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out; that we have seen Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership at least take some steps in the right direction of forming an inclusive government.\xc2\xa0 There is still a really important step remaining, which is the appointment of a head of government, a prime minister, in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that is not a minor step.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any circumstances in which the President will be consulted directly before additional military strikes are taken or is he now out of the picture in terms of approving the actual prosecution of this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has authorized the military to use force in this situation based on the limited scope that he has articulated.\xc2\xa0 He will not be in a situation where he is signing off on individual strikes but there will be regular consultation from the President\xe2\x80\x99s military commanders to their Commander-in-Chief about the situation on the ground and about the strategy that they\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he was advised before 6:45 a.m. this morning what was going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is not going to be in a position to authorize individual strikes but he will be regularly consulted by his military commanders about their strategy and about the assessment that they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do three more and then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go.\xc2\xa0 So, Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that include the Sinjar Mountain situation?\xc2\xa0 Because Erbil may be one thing because we have advisers there, et cetera -- what about the airstrikes on Sinjar Mountain and the people who are surrounded there?\xc2\xa0 Would the President have to sign off on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has already authorized military action in support of the humanitarian efforts that are underway at Sinjar Mountain.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about the importance of Iraqis electing a new inclusive -- forming a new inclusive government and electing a prime minister.\xc2\xa0 What if Prime Minister Maliki is reelected?\xc2\xa0 Is he someone that can lead an inclusive government and that the White House can work with?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it will be the responsibility of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership and the Iraqi people to determine who should lead their government.\xc2\xa0 And that was not a decision that will be dictated by the United States, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a decision that should be dictated by any sort of outside actor.\xc2\xa0 This should be squarely the decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders and by their people.</p>\n<p>And what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is not just who the person is, but what is the governing agenda that they pursue.\xc2\xa0 And if they pursue a governing agenda, like I said, that has the support of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population and makes clear to every citizen in Iraq that they have a government that is representing their interests, that is fighting for their future, that that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of government that will succeed in unifying the country.\xc2\xa0 And having a unified country is particularly important when you\xe2\x80\x99re facing an existential threat from an extremist group like ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a plan if the political transition falters or stalls?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously are going to continue to stay in regular touch with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to encourage them to continue to pursue the kind of inclusive government that they have started to form.\xc2\xa0 We have been encouraging them every step of the way and there continues to be regular consultation with them as they move down this path.</p>\n<p>We obviously would like to see them move quickly.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the history, it would indicate that there is not a history of Iraq moving quickly to make these kinds of decisions, but we have seen significant progress in just the last few weeks.\xc2\xa0 So we hope that that momentum will be sustained and that there will be an announcement about a prime minister soon.</p>\n<p>Olivier, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh, and thanks for sticking around.\xc2\xa0 First, I have a couple quick ones -- at least, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re quick.\xc2\xa0 First, building on your response to Sam about open-ended versus not prolonged.\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan to abide by the War Powers Act provision that calls for him to submit an authorization request within 60 days --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are some important War Powers Act notification requirements, and the United States will -- and the administration will abide by them, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s where I should start.\xc2\xa0 The administration has been consulting closely with Congress, as I mentioned earlier, and we have consulted with the relevant members of Congress from these committees just in the last 24 hours about the military action that the President has authorized.</p>\n<p>Consistent with those consultations, the administration will comply with any applicable reporting requirements in the War Powers Resolution.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes these War Power notifications are classified, sometimes they aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- in this case, if one is necessary and if our lawyers determine that it is necessary, I would anticipate that is something we likely would be able to release publicly.\xc2\xa0 So stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They send notifications, though, but not the request for congressional action, right?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a 60-day point at which the President is supposed to go back and ask for --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, right.\xc2\xa0 The only thing I can speak to right now is this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to complying with the notification requirements of the War Powers Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then building on your commendable decision to embrace the hypothetical question asked by my colleague, Jessica, earlier, can this President live with ISIL holding any stretch of territory, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s carved out of Iraq or Syria or anywhere else?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a hypothetical that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to evaluate because there are a lot of variations on that question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It goes back to Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question about sort of the longer-term strategy regarding ISIL.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it does.\xc2\xa0 Let me at least take a shot in one vein and say this:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine a scenario where you would have a stable Iraq with a security situation that\xe2\x80\x99s under control, where ISIL is freely operating in the countryside.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have worked so closely with the Iraqi government, Iraqi security forces and Kurdish security forces to counter this threat, and it is why it is the belief of the United States that it\xe2\x80\x99s only the Iraqis who can confront this problem.\xc2\xa0 The United States stands ready and has already demonstrated a willingness to support them as they do so, but ultimately this is a problem for Iraq to solve.</p>\n<p>Typically, on a Friday I would do a week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I think as you all know the President is planning to depart the White House tomorrow morning to begin his vacation with his family in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 He is looking forward to spending the next week or so with his family up there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is one item on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule next week -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 That will take place on Monday afternoon on Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 I believe that there will be some press access to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at that fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 The President is currently planning to return to Washington next Sunday just for a day or two of meetings here at the White House and return to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard to spend a few days with his family on Tuesday, and then returning the next Sunday back at the White House to get back to business.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- when he is back in town?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that there will be briefings at the White House during those two days.\xc2\xa0 Not next week, but the week after when the President is here.\xc2\xa0 So we will -- the President is traveling with members of his national security staff and the President\xe2\x80\x99s able Principal Deputy Press Secretary will also be on the trip with him, so you will be informed from highly qualified, in-the-know sources about what the President is up to while he is spending time up there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the family going to come back for those --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the family\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get you some additional details when that travel begins.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, there will be some briefings on the Vineyard?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule to lay out for you in terms of what those briefings will look like, but between the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, his Deputy National Security Advisor, and his Principal Deputy Press Secretary, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you well-informed.</p>\n<p>With that, I hope all of you get a chance to take a little bit of a break while the President is away as well.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a briefing in here in a couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:31 P.M.
