GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s go through a little of the schedule so we have a bit of a sense what we\'re working on.\xc2\xa0 I think that Ms. Hogan gave you guys the bait and tackle place -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an OTR stop, so please hold that location until we arrive there -- okay? -- which I\'ll talk about in just one second.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just for reporting, or even hold for people on the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, because, quite frankly, because the Service won\'t let us do it if it gets all out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'re going to land at approximately 1:20 p.m. local time.\xc2\xa0 I have on my sheet who will be there.\xc2\xa0 I will double-check this with you once both we land and we get into the briefing, because sometimes, based on -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been some trickier weather down here in the last couple days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s who I have:\xc2\xa0 National Incident Commander Admiral Thad Allen; Governor Jindal of Louisiana; Governor Crist of Florida; Governor Riley of Alabama; Senator Vitter of Louisiana; Congressman Melancon of Louisiana; Congressman Cao of Louisiana; New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu; EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson; several parish presidents, which I\'ll get -- I want to make sure who\xe2\x80\x99s here -- and a woman named Tracy Wareing, and I\'ll talk about her in one second.</p>\n<p>She works at the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s been dispatched here by FEMA to work through the BP claims process.\xc2\xa0 And let me go through that in a second.</p>\n<p>All right, so he\'ll be greeted there.\xc2\xa0 We will move to the Field House at the airport where the President will meet with all of these guys.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of that, we will do a full spray where the President will make some remarks.\xc2\xa0 Hogan and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s likely it will just be seated.</p>\n<p>MS. HOGAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very small room.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a small room, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll work on sort of how to set it up so everybody gets a chance -- it looks all -- you guys have good angles and such.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The reason why that\'s important is they\xe2\x80\x99ve made the call that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to drive from New Orleans to Grand Isle, which is a 20-minute helicopter ride and a two-and-a-half hour drive.\xc2\xa0 So that is going to bump, as you can imagine, everything way back.\xc2\xa0 So the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that reportable?\xc2\xa0 Can we let people know that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That we\xe2\x80\x99re driving?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes, you can.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we wanted to get some stuff in on the front end of this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the back end of this, we will go to -- let me make sure I\'ve got this right -- yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s, for lack of a better term, a bait and tackle store -- again, you guys have the name, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not put into the pool reports right now -- where we will meet with the mayor of Grand Isle, who the President also saw last week, as well as some folks that are from the area, to talk with him.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do some -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll open up the bottom of that, as well.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that when we get there again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what can we say he\xe2\x80\x99s doing in Grand Isle?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can say meeting with locals and small business owners about the economic and environmental impacts of this spill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we say with the mayor?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 And the mayor -- let me make sure -- I want to get this spelling -- here it is.\xc2\xa0 Mayor David Camardelle.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get the names of the other participants as well.\xc2\xa0 With any luck, the weather that is holding us for the drive down will pass and we will helo back.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to Washington around midnight.\xc2\xa0 Awesome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be any other stops?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s undetermined at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is the range of the schedule at this point.\xc2\xa0 Let me take a few questions before we land.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say why Governor Barbour doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be coming to these things?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, he\xe2\x80\x99s a regular participant on the calls that the White House does every -- daily.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I hesitate to say what the schedule -- what his schedule is.\xc2\xa0 I would point you over to his folks.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think most of the governors -- all of the governors have been -- obviously there are days in which they have some scheduling conflicts, but I know that almost all of them have been on -- regular attendance on the calls that are done.\xc2\xa0 These calls include -- are conducted by Valerie Jarrett, and as well have Coast Guard on them.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen was not on this morning\xe2\x80\x99s call because he was briefing at that time.</p>\n<p>I want to get you a press release that the JIC put out which will sort of give you some definition around what Tracy Wareing is doing and what the operation does in helping to process folks through the BP claims process and ensure that their claims are dealt with in a timely and expedited fashion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DisasterAssistance.gov is a website that has been enhanced as of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whoa!</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great website.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been enhanced in the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 If you go to it, the first thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll see is you can click on a link that will take you to pages on how to file BP claims and get answers to different questions and go through that process.\xc2\xa0 She will be, as I said, at the briefing today and with the President throughout the day to talk about some of the claims.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was she brought in because of dissatisfaction with how BP has been --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, she was brought in -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the exact timing -- she\xe2\x80\x99s been there for several weeks, I believe.\xc2\xa0 Let me get the exact timing.\xc2\xa0 But we wanted to ensure that there was somebody at the government\xe2\x80\x99s level ensuring that what was -- what BP had promised was actually being executed.\xc2\xa0 So the President suggested last week in his meeting with local officials that there be both Coast Guard and BP officials assigned at a county or parish level, depending on which jurisdiction.\xc2\xa0 And most of that I believe has been done so that there is somebody -- not just a person that deals with Alabama but a person that deals with both Mobile and Baldwin Counties; there\xe2\x80\x99s a person in Escambia, which is the westernmost Florida Panhandle county and home for Pensacola.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates on the riser package?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The last update we got was probably an hour or so ago -- everyone just hold on and we\xe2\x80\x99ll hope they hit the runway -- was that they were making some slow progress.\xc2\xa0 They were doing this -- slowly beginning to take in more hydrocarbon but doing it at a pace that did not show a great accumulation of hydrate, as we saw in the earlier efforts with the larger top hat structure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the slush, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Take in fewer hydrates, so it\xe2\x80\x99s working better?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Taking in fewer hydrates.\xc2\xa0 Again, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m long out of the prediction business on this.\xc2\xa0 Everyone is hopeful that this works.\xc2\xa0 We will get status throughout the day and over the next many hours as they evaluate the effectiveness of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you expect the President to be coming down here at least once a week going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the next schedule update.\xc2\xa0 I will try to find that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that it -- the last time I checked the schedule he was not coming down here next week, but I will check for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did you decide to cancel the Indonesia/Australia trip?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President made a decision that with all that\xe2\x80\x99s going on, particularly with our response right now, it would be difficult to go.\xc2\xa0 He called both leaders last evening, as you all saw, quite late, and we put out the statement that the President had decided to postpone that trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did he make that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Final decision was probably made either late yesterday afternoon or early yesterday evening, and the calls were set up for -- he made those calls sometime probably after -- sometime between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why does the President want to come down here? Why does he feel it\xe2\x80\x99s important to make these trips?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, I think that -- we believe we made tremendous progress last week in dealing with some of the concerns that were being heard down here, that we were hearing and seeing firsthand.\xc2\xa0 I think the President always wants to be able to do that.\xc2\xa0 We met the first time he was down here, on the 2nd of May, with local fishermen who expressed their concern for what could be happening.\xc2\xa0 And at that point we had -- I think at that point, we had just made the first decision -- NOAA had -- to close a portion of the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, a much larger portion of the Gulf has now been closed to fisheries -- to fishing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So being down here and talking -- and hearing directly from those impacted environmentally and economically, as I said, is important.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the claims process is important.\xc2\xa0 The response process is important.\xc2\xa0 And getting a firsthand accounting of all that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you -- Mary Landrieu has been pushing for a change in the revenue-sharing on offshore drilling in response to this.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys decided what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 After Katrina, Louisiana did receive some money as it related to offshore drilling, which may explain some of the consternation locally around pausing some of the deepwater drilling, though as I would say -- the reason I said \xe2\x80\x9cpauses,\xe2\x80\x9d none of those permits have been pulled; they\xe2\x80\x99ve just been paused. So any revenue -- revenue might slide, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to at this point be removed from the equation.</p>\n<p>I would add one more thing.\xc2\xa0 The flow rate technical group, the group of scientists headed by Marcia McNutt, head of USGS, that was stood up to measure the flow rate, is looking at and trying to evaluate where we are in the flow rate after this sheer cut that you all know was executed yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know if we\xe2\x80\x99ll get an update on that, but if we do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to you.\xc2\xa0 I will send updates to Katie when we first get in to make sure that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the parish presidents, local officials that are there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on the Israel flotilla situation.\xc2\xa0 I know the U.S. backs international participation in an investigation.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like Israel\xe2\x80\x99s government backs the same thing.\xc2\xa0 What kind of pressure are you guys putting on them to let\xc2\xa0 international participation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some discussions with them.\xc2\xa0 I think\xc2\xa0 -- let me make sure, because I have not checked my email on the flight.\xc2\xa0 I think there may have been some movement on that.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific about -- when you say he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with local businessmen in the Grand Isle part --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get the names and who they\xe2\x80\x99re involved with and I\'ll get that to you ASAP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to see any oil here?\xc2\xa0 Is there any time for him to see what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s coming closer and closer to Grand Isle.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s in Grand Isle.\xc2\xa0 One of the things about the trip -- we had to go to a place on short notice that we\xe2\x80\x99d previously been to, because we added this somewhat quickly and Service didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to come down before that.</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:05 P.M.
