EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One today, en route to Connecticut where the President will speak on the importance of acting on climate change and the risks this global threat poses to our national security in his commencement address to the United States Coast Guard Academy.</p>\n<p>The President, in his remarks, will highlight the immediate risks climate change poses to our national security, which includes contributing to increased national disasters resulting in humanitarian crises, and potentially increasing refugee flows and exacerbating conflicts over basic resources like food and water.</p>\n<p>One other risk that we look at is that how climate change can aggravate issues at home and abroad, including poverty, political instability and social tensions -- conditions that can fuel instability and enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I think most of you saw today, the White House also released a report on national security implications of climate change and how the federal government is rising to meet that challenge.\xc2\xa0 I encourage you all to look at that report if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t done so already.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go first.\xc2\xa0 There was a record number of vehicle recalls yesterday for Takata airbags.\xc2\xa0 Given that this is the latest in a series of similarly large vehicle recalls, is the President confident in the auto safety regulators and the auto industry to assure the public that our cars that we drive are safe?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Angela, the safety of the traveling of public is the Department of Transportation\xe2\x80\x99s number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 And as you mentioned, that department is taking a crucial step of making sure that every American car and truck owner has safe airbags in their vehicle.\xc2\xa0 Takata has agreed to declare that airbag inflators -- believed to be responsible for five deaths in the U.S. -- are defective, which I believe until now the company had refused to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is recalling those inflators and the recalls are nationwide.\xc2\xa0 We strongly encourage all vehicle owners to check safercar.gov for updates.\xc2\xa0 And if they receive a recall notice from their manufacturer, they should immediately call their dealer to make arrangements for free repairs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on the auto industry, given the series of recalls?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, we think the Department of Transportation is taking the extraordinary step of -- the extraordinary yet critical step of making sure that cars and trucks are safe with these airbags.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re taking the step.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, do you expect the President to talk at all today about the fight against ISIS at the Coast Guard Academy?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us, based on his meeting with the National Security Council yesterday, whether he had concerns, or anyone in the administration is concerned, about the use of Shiite militias to try to retake Ramadi, given that many of them are backed by Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Julie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more of a preview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks to give you at this time.\xc2\xa0 I encourage you to listen and watch closely up in Connecticut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you pointed out, the President did meet yesterday with his National Security Council to discuss the situation in Iraq and our strategy to counter the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on the latest developments in Iraq and our support of the Iraqi security forces and local tribal forces responding to the situation at Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 The President reaffirmed the strong U.S. support for Prime Minister al-Abadi\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, and welcomed the decision to accelerate training and equipping of local tribes in coordination with Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 The President reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the government of Iraq and the Iraqi people in the fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With regards to your specific question -- and Josh addressed this a little bit yesterday -- but the decision by Prime Minister Abadi to call on the Shia militia was one that was done in consultation with Anbari leaders and through a unanimous vote on Sunday by the Anbar Provincial Council.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have been clear that the decision to use these forces is one of the government of Iraq to make in conjunction with Anbari leaders.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been very clear that all forces there should be under the command and control of the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It may be their decision, but are there concerns in the administration that this could lead to sectarian violence, whether or not it was Abadi\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make?\xc2\xa0 We know that some of these militias have been involved in clashes like that before.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think, in response to your question, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the Council, in making this decision, strongly supported Prime Minister Abadi\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xc2\xa0 And we always are concerned about sectarian violence.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be important for these forces to be under the command and control of the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything more about the reports that Abu Sayyaf was one of Kayla Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s captors, and that his wife, who was captured when he was killed, is telling American officials about her captivity and giving them information about that?\xc2\xa0 What do you expect to learn from her?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any readouts of that process that is underway right now to offer for you.\xc2\xa0 But again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, Abu Sayyaf was a senior ISIL leader who, among other things, had a senior role in overseeing ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s oil and gas operations, a key source of revenue that enabled the terrorist organization to carry out their brutal tactics and oppress thousands of innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>He was also involved in the group\xe2\x80\x99s military operations.\xc2\xa0 He also may have been complicit in the enslavement of the young Yazidi woman we rescued.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the HIG was deployed to debrief Umm Sayyaf.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\'t have any readouts of that process to give you right now.\xc2\xa0 But as more information becomes available to release I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just say whether she\xe2\x80\x99s being cooperative?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today federal authorities indicted six Chinese citizens on charges that they sold trade secrets.\xc2\xa0 This comes just a few days after Secretary Kerry was in Beijing to talk about maritime tensions between China and its neighbors and at a time when the administration is pitching a trade deal that does not include China and, in fact, has been viewed in China as something of a containment strategy to some degree.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, ahead of -- we\'re just a few months out before the President of China comes for a visit -- does the administration feel like the trajectory of relations with China, the second biggest economy, or biggest, depending on how you measure it -- is headed in the wrong direction?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You packed a lot into that question, so let me just take the first part out which is I believe what you\'re talking about is the law enforcement action announced by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Those are independent decisions made by career prosecutors there, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to comment on that.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, as you point out, we are looking forward to that visit later this year.\xc2\xa0 And we have a complicated but good relationship with China.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work closely with them on a number of issues and we look forward to robust discussions on that visit later this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the President met with his national security advisors, did he decide to make any tweaks to his strategy for fighting Islamic State militants?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do want to be clear, Roberta, that there was no formal strategy review that is underway.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team meets frequently to review developments and determine how to best refine and carry out the strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy.</p>\n<p>This includes a systematic campaign of coalition airstrikes, while enabling local forces fighting ISIL on the ground, as well as supporting the Iraqi central government that governs in an inclusive and multi-sectarian manner.</p>\n<p>So I don\'t have any changes to announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any response to the oil spill in California last night?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that, John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leon Panetta had an editorial in The Wall Street Journal this morning suggesting that the President is risking U.S. national security by not opening oil to exports.\xc2\xa0 Is that an opinion that the President will weigh as he decides whether to change that policy?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen that report.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new policies to announce on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader today ruled out any interviews from inspectors with Iranian nuclear scientists.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering what the significance is of that and whether that will harm the efforts to reach a final agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I couldn\'t hear you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it harm the efforts -- letting inspectors talk to Iranian nuclear scientists, like interview them as part of their reviews?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\'t seen that specific piece.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that as part of the framework that was announced I believe two months ago now, Iran has agreed to the most robust, intrusive and stringent inspections and transparency regimes ever negotiated for any nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So the political framework which was announced a month or two now is now in the technical phases to get down to a final deal at the end of June.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m going to let those negotiators continue to do their work.\xc2\xa0 But we feel certain about the transparency and inspection regimes that Iran will have to agree to as part of the final deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any position on the legislation in the House that would cut back benefits for former Presidents?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Nancy, I saw that that passed the House Oversight Committee.\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to the President about it and I don\'t know if we\'ve been briefed on the details of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan is a key partner for the President on trade, I would say.\xc2\xa0 In an interview with Politico today he said it\'s important for the country and the Republican Party to get behind this trade deal because otherwise if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass that would be \xe2\x80\x9cthe punctuation mark on the declining narrative of America.\xe2\x80\x9d How would the President respond to that framed in that matter, to say that without this trade deal it\xe2\x80\x99s the punctuation mark on the declining narrative of the country?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been clear about, first of all, the trajectory of our economy over the past six years that the President has been in office.\xc2\xa0 As I think you know, we\'ve seen the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 That is 62 months that happens to coincide with the signing of the Affordable Care Act, for those keeping track.</p>\n<p>In terms of what this trade deal means, though, the President has been very clear that he thinks this is an opportunity for tremendous increased growth, continued growth for American companies.\xc2\xa0 As you know, U.S. goods and services exports supported an estimated 11.7 million jobs in 2014, 1.8 million more than in 2009, and that 95 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s consumers are outside U.S. borders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Paul Ryan framing it in that way, is that sort of a poor way to go about it, do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'ve been clear on the President\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for this.\xc2\xa0 Due to the grit and ingenuity and determination of the American workforce, our economy has come back from one of the worst economic eras since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And this particular trade deal presents an opportunity to take that economic growth even further.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of time the President is personally spending with House Democrats in an effort to pass the trade deal?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a quantity to read out to you, Christi, but I can tell you the President has been engaged with House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans -- because he believes it\'s in the best interest of not only American companies but the American worker.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll also make clear that the President is not only speaking with supporters of the trade deal but also skeptics to make sure that they understand how solid our arguments are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the last point I\xe2\x80\x99ll make is, the effort on the Hill is not limited to the President but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got senior administration officials both inside the White House and at the agencies all making the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in terms of senior administration officials?\xc2\xa0 I\'ll ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Would you compare -- I mean, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quantify how much time the President has spent on it, but would you compare it to the effort to pass the health care legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m hesitant to sort of parse that out.\xc2\xa0 I think that when the President has a priority pending before Congress -- take the Affordable Care Act, take raising minimum wage, take immigration reform, or take the trade deal -- there is no question that we do everything we can to make sure members have all the arguments -- all the information they need to make solid decisions on the merits.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that.\xc2\xa0 In the past, when members of Congress have raised concerns about labor and environmental provisions, the President\xe2\x80\x99s response -- and your response -- has been that there are enforceable, labor and environmental rules, in the text of the TPP.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday he issued a statement specifically saying that he backed certain provisions in the Trade Promotion Authority bill that would apply to labor and environmental and other rules.\xc2\xa0 Is this a shift on the part of the President?\xc2\xa0 Is he acknowledging that some of those issues are going to have to be in the fast track bill in order for it to pass Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Julie.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has always been clear that the landmark labor provisions, the environmental safeguards, and the human rights protections are both historic in the nature of how robust they are, but also that they\xe2\x80\x99re enforceable and that they should indeed be included in the body of the text.</p>\n<p>This is something that we have looked at in terms of past trade deals -- noted that they are on side agreements or side notes, and that because of that, they\xe2\x80\x99re not as enforceable as if they were in the body of the text.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has insisted they be included.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if that\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient, then why is there any necessity to include any of this, including currency, in the fast track bill?\xc2\xa0 Why would you have to include that if the provisions of the trade agreement itself are so binding?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I might refer you to our technical folks at the USTR.\xc2\xa0 I believe -- the President has been clear that these pieces should be included in the body of the text because, again, that is the only way to ensure that they can be fully enforceable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question kind of related to today\xe2\x80\x99s event.\xc2\xa0 Since the President is going to be talking about carbon emissions and carbon pollution, can you give us an update on where the administration is at in determining whether the Keystone pipeline significantly contributes to carbon emissions?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, that is a policy review that\xe2\x80\x99s underway at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has gone pretty much as far as he can go with executive orders on climate change.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s tried the health arguments, environmental arguments, national security arguments.\xc2\xa0 How does he push his agenda forward?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you, Nancy, for giving me an opportunity to review how much we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over the past six years on this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made unprecedented investments to cut energy waste in our homes and our buildings.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve doubled the fuel efficiency of our vehicles so we\xe2\x80\x99re putting less carbon in the air.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re using more clean energy than ever before -- 20 times more solar, three times more wind.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced carbon emissions more than any other advanced nation and today, our carbon pollution is near its lowest levels in almost two decades.</p>\n<p>Again, I believe the report that we issued earlier talks about not only the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the past six years but also efforts happening in real time to continue and build on that progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much more he can do.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, Nancy.\xc2\xa0 I know that this is a priority for the President.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly looking at the tools in our toolbox, given that this is such an important priority for the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t10:16 A.M.
