b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>* The President spoke with FEMA Administrator Fugate today at 1:15p.m.EDT about Hurricane Earl.</p>\n<p>* The President was briefed on the oil platform fire in the Gulf and the government response today by Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>12:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Let me begin with one just quick statement on Hurricane Earl.</p>\n<p>The President is closely monitoring and aggressively preparing for the storm as it continues to head toward the East Coast.\xc2\xa0 On its current track, Hurricane Earl could approach the coast of North Carolina by late tonight or early Friday morning.</p>\n<p>Last night the President signed a pre-landfall emergency declaration for the state of North Carolina, ensuring the state has what it needs beforehand.\xc2\xa0 And FEMA has already moved teams and supplies into states along the East Coast to provide support and resources as needed.</p>\n<p>As you know, yesterday Administrator Fugate provided the President with an update, and FEMA is in close contact and coordination with the governors and their teams up and down the eastern seaboard to ensure that they have the support they need should the storm make landfall later tonight or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I do expect that the President will speak with the FEMA administrator again today, and we will let you know when that happens.*</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Mideast.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sort of update to offer on how the talks are going so far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me give you just a little bit from -- well, obviously, as you all know, the talks are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 We expect that at some point, I would say in the next hour or so, Senator Mitchell, our special envoy for Middle East peace, will conduct a briefing on what has transpired today.</p>\n<p>I would say that the President was encouraged in his meetings yesterday by the very serious attitude that each of the leaders brought about these talks and about a long-term lasting peace for the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 All view this as a tremendously important opportunity.\xc2\xa0 I think you all saw the pictures last evening and the powerful statements that were made by the leaders in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would also say that the President, as he did in the Rose Garden yesterday afternoon, remind everyone that there are still deep divisions.\xc2\xa0 There are still years of mistrust to overcome.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be wiped away in one meeting or in one day, and we understand that.</p>\n<p>The failure, though -- the failure to try is not something the President wants to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems like one of those deep divisions that you speak of is Hamas.\xc2\xa0 How does the administration plan to deal with them?\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize Israel.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re promising more attacks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan for dealing with Hamas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I defer questions about what transpired today in the talks until Senator Mitchell has an opportunity to answer some of those questions at the conclusion of the meetings today.\xc2\xa0 All right?</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question about Christy Romer\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday.\xc2\xa0 She said -- I have it in front of me -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe only surefire ways for policymakers to substantially increase aggregate demand in the short run are for the government to spend more and tax less.\xc2\xa0 In my view, we should be moving forward in both fronts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>That sounds like setting a stage for a second stimulus.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be somewhat broad in my answer and a little -- let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to -- well, both what the President said and what I said on Monday.\xc2\xa0 And I think the actions and the steps that this administration has taken over the course of the past two years -- first and foremost, the President is -- and the team are looking at ideas.\xc2\xa0 And he enumerated some of those parameters, including infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And certainly in terms of cutting taxes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bill pending before the United States Senate that the President -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak on many occasions that would, indeed, cut taxes on small business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think if you look at -- if you go back to a year ago, outside of the Recovery Act, we pursued and the President signed legislation that enabled Cash for Clunkers.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke in December of last year about targeted measures that can be taken to help the recovery.\xc2\xa0 Those have included the bipartisan HIRE Act, which helps cut taxes for those that do add employees.\xc2\xa0 We have expanded -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve given states more money to ensure that things like teachers and firefighters weren\xe2\x80\x99t laid off.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve expanded and continued unemployment insurance, and a small business bill has passed the House.</p>\n<p>So look, we will continue to look at and take steps that are, as I talked about on Monday, that are targeted in nature, to help continue the recovery and to help create an environment where the private sector is adding jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we are all aware of the steps that have been taken.\xc2\xa0 What Dr. Romer seems to be saying here is that a lot more spending needs to come to make this economic recovery increase.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to what the President said on Monday.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is -- I think -- I would -- again, I would point you to what the President said is -- as ideas that are being looked at.\xc2\xa0 And as I said here on Monday, some big new stimulus plan is not in the offing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you interpret, then, what she said?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would interpret what she said to be very much in line with what the President said on Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on that, on jobs, what does the President expect out of the jobless numbers tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 And has the economic team come up with some of those new ideas that you talked about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take the second question first, and that is those meetings and those discussions continue to take place.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of any of those ultimate decisions.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s probably -- well, it is not helpful for me to speculate on the jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 I say this for the benefit of anybody that is watching -- I do not know the numbers, I will not know the numbers, just so anything that is said in the next several minutes has nothing to do with my knowledge about the numbers.\xc2\xa0 I do that because everybody gets nervous that if I make a comment, somehow I knew the number.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an oil-production platform in the Gulf that\xe2\x80\x99s on fire.\xc2\xa0 Does it present any of the same problems of the BP rig?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not under a moratorium.\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything more about the accident?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say -- here\xe2\x80\x99s what I know before we came\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 out here.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- I\xe2\x80\x99m told this is a production platform about 100 miles off the coast.\xc2\xa0 I am told the depth of water is about 340 feet.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a -- this is not a deepwater facility.</p>\n<p>As I understand it, the well was not in active production.\xc2\xa0 I will in some ways reiterate what I think the Coast Guard has said in a statement that they\xe2\x80\x99ve released, and that is that they responded to the preliminary reports of a fire onboard an oil platform in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 The initial report that we got were that 13 persons -- 13 people were on the platform.\xc2\xa0 They are accounted for; one is injured and is on his way out of that area.</p>\n<p>Two Coast Guard cutters, multiple Coast Guard aircraft were en route.\xc2\xa0 One Coast Guard helicopter was on the scene.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to gather information as we respond.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have response assets ready for deployment should we receive reports of pollution in the water.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President convinced that the inspection of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico is moving fast enough?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not gotten a recent update on that.\xc2\xa0 I will try to get one.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have taken some -- we took a series of steps after the BP incident, primarily around deepwater drilling.\xc2\xa0 Let me not go too much further than what I have.\xc2\xa0 And if the situation warrants, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly update that.</p>\n<p>I will say the President was in a meeting in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s been notified.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan, who was in that meeting, does know about the incident.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- before somebody asks -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the Sit Room meeting on?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a national security meeting -- that John had or had not had a chance to discuss that with the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who would be in charge -- just following up on the Coast Guard?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not know who is on the scene, but you can -- the Coast Guard obviously -- the production facility is located in federal waters.\xc2\xa0 They are the ones that are in response.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- who the highest-ranking person is on the scene.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just following up on the Middle East peace talks, what does the President see as his role going forward now?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s appropriately set the stage and now it\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary Clinton who is taking the lead?\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional talks, say, hosted by Egypt, would the President be the one who would be attending, or is he stepping back now and letting --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any scheduling pronouncements.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this in a couple ways.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Clinton has -- is conducting and is the lead on this as she conducts these meetings today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our special envoy, George Mitchell, has spent a lot of time in the region, as has the Secretary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, we have said this from the very beginning, and as I mentioned the other day, one of the very first things the President did upon walking into the Oval Office that very first, full morning was to make calls to leaders in the region, some of whom obviously were here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think this is true historically, and that is when we are actively involved and engaged, there\xe2\x80\x99s a better chance for peace.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint and the whole team\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint.</p>\n<p>So I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to what our involvement would be at different points in this -- leave that for a sort of situational discussion.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we have over the past many months been actively involved and engaged and will continue to be actively involved and engaged, as the best way to make progress, we have always felt, is to do so the same way they\xe2\x80\x99re doing today, and that is to sit at that table and have direct talks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President see this scenario differently and more optimistically than previous administrations, A, because of more stability in the West Bank, or because of the potential mutual threat from Iran becoming nuclear?\xc2\xa0 How does he see this as any different than previous administrations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d say first and foremost, I think the President felt that the meetings yesterday, as he said, were productive and believed that each of the leaders was genuine and serious about seeking peace.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we understand that this is -- as I said earlier, this is something that has eluded generations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that.</p>\n<p>So we will stay engaged.\xc2\xa0 We will do what is necessary, and then we hope that each side will continue to take steps necessary to make -- build confidence and make these talks productive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that the mutual -- potential mutual threat by a nuclear Iran is helping bring these two sides together?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we have always maintained that peace was in the best interest of each of these entities involved, regardless of anything else in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 I think that was true when the President first came in and certainly is true and is governing our actions today.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The numbers for members of Congress have gone through the floor in recent weeks, for the Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that is?\xc2\xa0 And why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President done more during the recess in August basically to try to shore them up?\xc2\xa0 It looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re in a terrible spot.\xc2\xa0 The numbers for members of Congress --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which numbers?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The polling numbers for people who are running for office.\xc2\xa0 Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 numbers have nosedived during the month of August.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You sound like a radio guy when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing the -- nosedive --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I could give you a chart, but you get the idea.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, look, we are -- the President will continue to make a very active case for the steps that the administration has taken and why we have to continue to move forward on that path.</p>\n<p>Bill, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much during August.\xc2\xa0 Why not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Bill, the President has been fairly active in both campaigning and in raising money.\xc2\xa0 What the President is helping the Democratic National Committee do is something that the Democratic National Committee has never done in supporting Senate and congressional candidates.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is it that they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The level of support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following up on what Ann was saying about the economy, not about the numbers tomorrow, but the snapshot that we got today of the new unemployment claims down, but also productivity down and labor costs up -- what does that snapshot tell you about the state of the recovery?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- let me give you an answer that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily based on one unemployment claims report today because I am somewhat hesitant to get into what are always going to be the week-to-week swings of unemployment claims.</p>\n<p>I think it is safe to say that we are in a markedly different and better position than we were a year or a year and a half ago.\xc2\xa0 Our economy is expanding.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve created about 600,000 private sector jobs throughout the course of this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I have said earlier and I think as the President has said, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the trajectory of that recovery based on events, particularly in Greece, have changed that trajectory from where we were at some point in the spring.</p>\n<p>We have to continue to be mindful of whatever steps might be necessary to continue that recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are those?\xc2\xa0 What do you do to turn it around or get it going in a stronger, higher trajectory?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s some of the discussions that the economic team is having.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to what the President said in the Rose Garden about that on Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and one other thing on FEMA.\xc2\xa0 You said FEMA is moving teams along the East Coast and supplies.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us more details on where and what supplies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me get a comprehensive list and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send it around to you at the end of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said and the President said on Monday that you all are considering a range of new items on the economy to try to turn things around.\xc2\xa0 Assuming time is of the essence, can you give us a sense of how soon you might roll some of these out, and whether you would do it piece by piece or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that those -- obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re still doing meetings and discussions on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s something that you\xe2\x80\x99d rather do sooner rather than later?\xc2\xa0 Or is it a matter of -- would you do it piece by piece?\xc2\xa0 Or do you want to roll out --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the final decisions would have to be made before I\xe2\x80\x99d have a good understanding to be able to talk about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that so much of recovery has to do with confidence and how people feel about the economy, can you talk about what your strategy is in terms of how to talk about the economy, tempering the balance between being realistic but also trying to convey confidence?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President -- I would point to what the President said in his speech to the nation on Iraq, that we are and always have been a very special country.\xc2\xa0 We are in charge of our own destiny.</p>\n<p>I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President over the past many weeks talk about the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, and the fact that if you look at, again, where we were at the end of 2008 and even the first quarter or so in 2009, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s important progress yet to make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President continues to look at ideas that might help create an environment for more private sector hiring.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to look at and make investments that are important in creating the jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about a combination of that, expressing confidence that we are headed in the right direction, albeit not as quickly as anybody, including the President, would like to see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President tell people they should save right now because we\xe2\x80\x99re in a trying time?\xc2\xa0 Or they should spend because the economy is strong and it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President would say that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into individual purchasing decisions.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would say that we are making progress, that our economy is stronger than it\xe2\x80\x99s been in a while.\xc2\xa0 And we have to continue to be mindful of and try to make progress on making that -- making this recovery one that\xe2\x80\x99s even stronger.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt, Savannah, there are -- the depths of what we entered are unlike anything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big hole to fill and a lot of jobs to create to put the people that are -- that want to work fully back to work.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal obviously is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then real quick, GM put off its IPO and road show until after the election.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if the White House or the administration had anything to do with that timing decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The White House is not involved in and not going to discuss IPO based on regulators watching what people do and say around IPOs.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me come at this economic question a different way.\xc2\xa0 Congress is going to be back in Washington in a week and a half.\xc2\xa0 Beside the small business bill, what is on the President\xe2\x80\x99s must-do list before they\xe2\x80\x99re back out and campaigning?\xc2\xa0 Because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I know you caveated by saying you assume small business.\xc2\xa0 But I -- this is something the President has talked a lot about.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to spend another 30 seconds doing it one more time because I -- what this town does a lot is, okay, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing now, but what are you going to do next.\xc2\xa0 I point out that the article that I held up here just the other day -- small businesses have delayed their hiring decisions, small businesses have delayed their expansion decisions, small businesses have delayed their investment decisions, waiting to see what the Senate will do on the small business bill.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to discount that the engine of our economy -- as the President said, 60 percent of the job losses come from small business.\xc2\xa0 There are some concrete steps that we can and should take when Congress does come back in a week and a half to change that.</p>\n<p>Obviously the President is mindful of the tax cuts for the middle class that expire at the end of the year, and the President will fight to ensure that those middle-class tax cuts are protected.\xc2\xa0 I think that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have a fairly robust discussion on, not just in the remaining weeks of Congress but throughout the election and maybe after the election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From what I understand, Nancy Pelosi is worried that as the tax cut debate goes on this fall in the Senate that the White House will cave to pressures from some moderate Democrats to just extend all the tax cuts for another year.\xc2\xa0 Can you reassure her of that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I like that you\xe2\x80\x99re my Nancy Pelosi go-between, Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I will reiterate what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said throughout this debate, and that is the President believes that the tax cuts for those in the middle class should be maintained, they should be kept.\xc2\xa0 The money that would be spent to keep those tax breaks for people that make more than $250,000 a year -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that the majority of the money that would be spent next year on maintaining those tax cuts are for people that make more than a million dollars a year -- okay?\xc2\xa0 That is a statistical fact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are -- if the Republicans are bent on spending an additional $35 billion, I think there are many economists and certainly the Congressional Budget Office has looked at many ways that could stimulate the economy -- extending the tax cuts for the wealthiest, those that are making that million dollars, is the least stimulative way to impact our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we are focused first and foremost and only on extending tax cuts for the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick question --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Please relay that back to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bunch of openings -- new chairman of the CEA, Consumer Financial Protection Agency, Comptroller of the Currency.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Jonathan, the CEA thing is not going to work out, but -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 God, if you were even thinking about that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Amy was supposed to tell you that before the briefing started.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have timing on any of these --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier in the week, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that CEA and Consumer would be done this week.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Dr. Romer\xe2\x80\x99s tenure concludes tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I do not have a timeline for those two openings.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you say what the NSC meeting is about today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A series of national security issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Routine?\xc2\xa0 Or urgent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Some -- no, I would not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get everybody nervous.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President does fairly regularly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in his speech on Tuesday night, President Obama said that there could be patriots on both sides of the Iraq issue.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe there could be patriots on both sides of health care issue, government spending, taxes and the like?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, first, inherent in your question, Mark, is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that if the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President is not going to question the patriotism of those that have a different view than him.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s never been -- they may have policy disagreements, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, based on those disagreements -- at least the President would not make the argument that somebody is more or less patriotic based on the fact that they share his position on a certain policy issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he accuses Republicans of game-playing, of holding issues hostage.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that certainly casts a dispersion --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you have it both ways?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s take, for instance, what the President said on Monday about the small business bill.\xc2\xa0 The President asked the Republican Party to end the blockade on needed and necessary aid for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 What I think is somewhat undeniable is they\xe2\x80\x99ve held up that bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if the Republicans are proud of holding that bill up, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they should have any problem with the President mentioning that they\xe2\x80\x99re holding that bill up.</p>\n<p>I do think that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat if not markedly different from questioning their patriotism for holding up the bill, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a lighter note, any comment from the President on the reviews of the new Oval Office d\xc3\xa9cor?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him give a review on the reviews.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he involved in picking the color scheme?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will tell you, Mark, that is not something -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised that I was not consulted stylistically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you officially neutral?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, you would match very well.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying for one more day in the summer, so don\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into my suit.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great headline in the Style section -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe Audacity of Taupe.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I heard Burton say that first, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he got some sort of a credit on that.</p>\n<p>Julianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The rig explosion today -- it is in shallow water, but would it have any impact on the current deepwater drilling moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 And I say that largely because obviously we are still trying to gather information about the events that are happening at that site right now.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously there is a process at the Department of Interior around the existing deepwater moratorium.\xc2\xa0 Hard to match those two issues up based on the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know a ton at the moment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President has been briefed on this yet, but is it possible that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My sense is that Brennan will likely have told him at the end of that meeting, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that for sure yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the current investigation into the Deepwater Horizon explosion, is it possible that that could be brought in -- does this raise new concerns about shallow-water drilling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me do this.\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- I will go back and get as much of an update as we can throughout the day and see if any of that changes.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- at this point, based on what we know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry those two up.\xc2\xa0 I will double-check today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So tomorrow is Dr. Romer\xe2\x80\x99s last day.\xc2\xa0 The White House had said that you had hoped to fill that vacancy by her last day.\xc2\xa0 With the jobs report tomorrow, with the economic team trying -- working to come up with new measures, is there -- is it at all significant that there is a void now on the economic --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- look, obviously there are -- we have a pretty full and robust team that will meet with the President in about 15 minutes.\xc2\xa0 Obviously as soon as we have an announcement on a CEA replacement we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be an acting director in the interim?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There could be.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- none of those, that I know of, none of those final decisions have been made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one last question.\xc2\xa0 Larry Summers and Tom Donilon are going to China next week.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk on what\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda, what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of that visit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put out some stuff on that in a little bit, so let me wait for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s you or Mitchell.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s you or Mitchell.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen there, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t take it personally.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said both that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- no new big stimulus plans are in the offing; on the other hand, the economic team is looking for new ideas.\xc2\xa0 Has the President come to any conclusions about whether any new policy initiatives, other than the ones that are stalled in the Senate, could affect the economy between now and Labor Day?\xc2\xa0 Just some basic --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- let me, first of all, in that first part, when I say -- inherent in the first part of your question is, as I said and as the President said on Monday, we are mindful of, as I listed earlier, targeted measures that can or should be taken in order to continue a trajectory of recovery.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, again, Mara, those meetings are ongoing in identifying and looking at a whole host of those ideas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m confused about is, I mean, the meetings are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 The economy has been stalling for a while.\xc2\xa0 You have a very short time frame here.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some sense of urgency about getting new targeted initiatives if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me speak broadly.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a sense of urgency about the economy since the moment we walked in here.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we have had to and we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some extraordinary steps to ensure that a recession did not become the next Great Depression.</p>\n<p>Obviously we are mindful that -- as I think I said this the other day, that we are -- we do not want to see -- this is not a purely academic exercise.\xc2\xa0 So obviously, as Jonathan mentioned, Congress is soon -- will soon be back in town, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not for very long.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not for very long, but obviously I anticipate that some of those decisions will get made -- will be made before that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on a specific piece of that.\xc2\xa0 You said that the Republicans were -- are hell bent on -- that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your exact words, on adding $35 million -- on $35 million to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 There are more targeted ways to do that that are more stimulative than extending the tax cuts for the rich.\xc2\xa0 How open is the President to a payroll tax holiday for employers and/or employees as one of those targeted things?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to say, Mara, that obviously the team is looking at a whole host of issues.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it makes sense for me to get into what those are or might be individually.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President tomorrow going to make any public statements about the job numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some Dems seem to be worried that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem focused enough on the economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those Democrats who have those concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Like who?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to, Democratic aides on the Hill who say that they feel like the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t focused enough.\xc2\xa0 This week, of course, was dominated by foreign policy mostly.\xc2\xa0 He inserted some comments about the economy in his Iraq speech.\xc2\xa0 But those are some of the concerns that I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who exactly you talked to but, again, this President has been focused on dealing with the economic problems that we faced the moment we came in here.\xc2\xa0 We faced a housing crisis, a crisis in financial stability.\xc2\xa0 Eight million jobs had been lost; the economy was contracting.\xc2\xa0 For years, while productivity was up, paychecks were not.</p>\n<p>The President has had to deal with each and every one of those issues.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress on reducing foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 We have gone from an economy that was contracting to one that\xe2\x80\x99s expanding.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from an economy that was shedding jobs to an economy that is creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 So we have taken the necessary steps, many of them extraordinary in changing the direction of our economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to dedicate more time to that than anything else on his schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say this, because the President is giving a speech on Iraq does not mean that the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t dealing with the economy, just like when there is something to deal with in foreign policy or in the economy, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not dealing with something internationally.</p>\n<p>I mean, what comes with this job is -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 I have only worked here since sometime in the afternoon of the 20th of January 2009.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to come here where somebody greeted me at the door and said, good news, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one problem today.\xc2\xa0 Trust me, every morning I pull up in hopes that someone does greet me like that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that it will happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one more on the economy and the measures that you\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating.\xc2\xa0 Without getting into specifics, has the President looked at the numbers, which do show a pretty dramatic slowdown in the recovery, and said, we need something dramatic here?\xc2\xa0 Is something dramatic needed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President continues to ask the economic team for what ideas they believe can help the economy now.\xc2\xa0 Look, we have seen -- look, I mean, part of this obviously is there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt, as I said earlier, that the economic growth trajectory is not what it was in the spring.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has asked folks to look at.</p>\n<p>Some of these -- some of the measures that we see, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk specifically about one week\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment claims -- if you look at car -- if you were to open the paper today and look at car sales, car sales today are compared to -- they usually do year-to-year comparisons.\xc2\xa0 GM car sales down 28 percent or whatever they were.\xc2\xa0 Those are comparisons to last August when Cash for Clunkers was there, when we were selling cars not at a rate of 11 or 11.5 million a year, but at 14 million a year, which is obviously what we would strive to get to, but not where we are economically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So certainly the President has throughout the past many weeks kept up to speed and up to date on the latest economic data.\xc2\xa0 Some of it has shown, as I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- while there\xe2\x80\x99s a change in growth, you look at something like yesterday where I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- without divining everything that happens in the stock market, that you had a pretty big rally fueled largely on a manufacturing index that showed, for instance, employment at a rate that folks hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen on that index since the early 1980s.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a no, that the data doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require something dramatic or eye-catching?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I do not anticipate something that rivals the extraordinary measures that the President has already taken.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up?\xc2\xa0 You do seem to be laying the ground for modest changes.\xc2\xa0 Peter Orszag said if you extended over 10 years all the 2001, 2003, it would cost $700 billion.\xc2\xa0 But arguably, if you only do it for one year, it costs $70 billion.\xc2\xa0 Is that affordable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about for the upper end, or are you talking about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All of them.\xc2\xa0 Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s take -- I think if you break out one year of -- I think if you were to extend the upper-end tax cuts for next year, I think the price tag is $35 billion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so that\xe2\x80\x99s even --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he veto a bill that has them in it, by the way?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into a hypothetical like that.\xc2\xa0 The President does not support extending the tax cuts for those that make, on average, about a million dollars a year.\xc2\xa0 Those are -- again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty safe to say -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m being malicious to the Republican argument -- that they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about spending, right?\xc2\xa0 That does not seem to necessarily carry over to tax cuts for those that make a million dollars a year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that we should focus our tax relief on the middle class, certainly, one, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to make reckless economic decisions to extend tax cuts for people that weren\xe2\x80\x99t asking for them and didn\xe2\x80\x99t need them.\xc2\xa0 And secondly, even if you did want to do something like that, there are, as I said earlier, far more -- far better ways, far more stimulative ways to impact the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- just to follow up on a question by Mara about a payroll tax holiday.\xc2\xa0 When you mentioned new hires incentives, that expires.\xc2\xa0 But would you be in favor of an additional extension of that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the team is looking at a range of ideas.\xc2\xa0 I, for a lot of reasons, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into each individual one.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In his Iraq speech, the President mentioned that the economic recovery is a central preoccupation.\xc2\xa0 How are Americans to know that that is his primary concern?\xc2\xa0 Does he need to -- in terms of the way he prioritizes his time, can he show Americans that the economy is his primary preoccupation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- having been here since the beginning, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an issue that the President has spent more time on than the economy, than on the economic recovery, than on financial stability, than on housing, than on -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow up.\xc2\xa0 But when Americans see the President travel abroad, when Americans see him take a vacation -- not that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve vacations, as do many people in this room -- (laughter) -- but might they draw the conclusion --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting way of phrasing it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Surely the people in the first two rows.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t they --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Careful, careful.\xc2\xa0 Getting into row warfare.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might they draw conclusions that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of -- it\xe2\x80\x99s maybe -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily see the things you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, how the President multitasks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think of an example that would help illuminate -- I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s take for instance -- I think everybody would say getting our policy right in Afghanistan is very important.\xc2\xa0 I think that is of concern to many in this country.</p>\n<p>When the President was undergoing 13 different two- to three-hour meetings on that, the notion that somehow that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing he was doing -- again, I can hardly wait for the day in which there\xe2\x80\x99s only one problem, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one meeting, it\xe2\x80\x99s only on one topic.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not true today.\xc2\xa0 The President is -- will come from the Situation Room, I think the schedule says he\xe2\x80\x99s going to eat lunch, which he should do, and then he goes into an economic meeting.</p>\n<p>So, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just hard for me to I guess craft into words exactly the fact that, again, he -- there are pressing problems domestically.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously is the Commander-in-Chief and has to make decisions about our foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 But, Peter, having been here from the beginning, there is not an issue or set of issues the President has spent more time on than dealing with the economic situation that we walked into the 20th of January 2009.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President made any plans on how he\xe2\x80\x99ll commemorate 9/11, and is a trip to Ground Zero a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not have -- I have not looked at the block ahead.\xc2\xa0 Let me go do that.\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it -- I mean, are you looking at a number of places?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here or go abroad?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go look at the block so I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- so I have some information on that.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on jobs, Gallup just came out with a poll on August underemployed numbers, said the numbers went up from 18.4 percent to 18.6 percent -- underemployed meaning those without full-time work.\xc2\xa0 Is that included in what the President is trying to do to get people back to work?\xc2\xa0 And talk to me about how.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think, again, creating -- what you have seen happen in this economy is productivity has increased; what -- temporary work has increased, meaning employers have taken the steps of adding hours but not necessarily adding additional full-time workers.\xc2\xa0 There are any number of people that, in the monthly employment survey, are included in -- would be included in a group of people that would like to work more if they could.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why you typically hear that -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why, typically, on a day like tomorrow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear an unemployment number and an underemployment number -- those that would like to have additional work but can\xe2\x80\x99t find it.</p>\n<p>Obviously those are just as much a focus as those that don\xe2\x80\x99t have work and need it, because inherent in solving either of -- inherent in dealing with either of those two groups is greater full-time employment and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what the President and the team are looking through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on this platform -- this production platform explosion, would you talk to me about how and why Justice is involved in this right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why Justice is involved?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand Justice is looking into this, they\xe2\x80\x99re investigating this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.\xc2\xa0 The information I got was from the Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 So I will go back and see if there are -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s Justice involvement in what\xe2\x80\x99s happened today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the administration concerned at all by the fact that Mariner Energy has links to BP when this whole situation happened?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any broad statements on today\xe2\x80\x99s -- on what I know about today\xe2\x80\x99s incident when I came out here.\xc2\xa0 Let me go back -- I think I said I\xe2\x80\x99d go back and look and just get a better or fuller update throughout the day and see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to return to the subject of the Mideast peace process and try to flesh out which calls the President has made, especially for Arab support, beyond obviously Egypt and Jordan.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, has he been in contact with Saudi leaders, Kuwaitis, Moroccans, Qataris?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us who he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to and what their feedback has been?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe he has talked with King Abdullah recently.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the -- I can get the exact date of that and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think a readout on that would actually be really helpful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- what\xe2\x80\x99s today?\xc2\xa0 It would have happened earlier in the week, so let me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prior to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s arrival?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, on -- Monday was the 31st, right?\xc2\xa0 They all sort of blur together.\xc2\xa0 I believe that they spoke on Air Force One on Monday.\xc2\xa0 But I will -- let me go see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a readout of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since his meetings yesterday, since his bilats yesterday, and in the course of today where presumably he will -- when he talks with George Mitchell and get a readback on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on -- do you expect ongoing telephone calls to leaders --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me do this.\xc2\xa0 Let me get a better answer to that based on discussing with him after he\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to talk with Senator Mitchell.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously both Secretary Clinton and Senator Mitchell have been deeply, deeply involved in this, so let me include what their activity might be as well.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, the Arab Peace Initiative, which Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s King Abdullah mentioned last night, is an initiative that Saudi King Abdullah put together.\xc2\xa0 Was he at all -- was he invited to attend these talks, or was he consulted beforehand?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, again, I believe they spoke Monday or Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go -- let me go back and find -- and we will try to find a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that would just be a day before the talks would take place --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get a better readout on exactly what was said and what might have transpired.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was invited to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know directly the answer to that but let me find out.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details about the dinner last night?\xc2\xa0 The Israelis released that Prime Minister Netanyahu gave some gift of peace to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There was -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to describe it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and -- it was in the Oval, in the outer Oval last night, so I can go back and look at what that gift was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, to clarify, you said -- this is a different track than Mara took -- you said that some big new stimulus plan is not in the offing, but the economic team is looking at a host of issues.\xc2\xa0 That host of issues -- the exception is a big stimulus?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just safe to characterize -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll characterize it today the way I characterized it on Monday, and I think the way the President characterized it on Monday, and that is targeted ideas to continue to spur the recovery and create an environment for private sector hiring.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So something even resembling what we saw when you all first came to office is off the table?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not been in a meeting where that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the other thing I wanted to ask was, Bill mentioned the polling numbers in a nosedive, as he put it.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe the President can arrest those numbers, or at least help?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to one of the answers I gave Bill, which is the unprecedented amount of effort and support that the DNC is providing to congressional candidates, to each of the Senate and congressional committees.\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we saw this last year.\xc2\xa0 This is -- I think the President will help make the case, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not anticipate that -- look, go back and look at polling from 2009 about -- in a lot of these races, there are issues that are not going to be decided either in support of or opposition to the President.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, for the last four days, Glenn Beck has criticized the President for believing in liberation theology, which he calls a Marxist form of Christianity.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, does the President, to your knowledge, even know what liberation theology is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Bill, a crude paraphrasing of an old quote, and that is people are entitled to their own opinion, as ill-informed as it may be, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not entitled to their own facts.\xc2\xa0 The President is a committed mainstream Christian.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I have no evidence that would guide me as to what Glenn Beck would have any genuine knowledge as to what the President does or does not believe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is he going back to church?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this Marxist form of Christianity --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can only imagine where Mr. Beck conjured that from.</p>\n<p>Kirk.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be pleased if on Election Day people say -- people base their vote on whether they\xe2\x80\x99re better off -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re better off on Election Day than when then-Senator Obama was elected?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the measures that people will generally use.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- this may not be true for every person, obviously, but there are -- I think, Kirk, if you look at where our economy will likely be November the 2nd of 2010 and where it was that beautiful November day in 2008, they\xe2\x80\x99re very different places.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a little of the jobs numbers -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the jobs numbers -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know the jobs numbers?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\xc2\xa0 I think I used this statistic earlier in the briefing, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve created 600,000 private sector jobs in this year alone.\xc2\xa0 To take your point of comparison, in the previous -- in the last six months of 2008, we lost 3 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s been a change in that trajectory.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Kirk -- and I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this on a number of answers today -- that is not satisfying to the President because obviously our economy has to grow more, we have to add more to the rolls of the employed and take them out of the rolls of the unemployed.\xc2\xa0 And the President understands because he is among those that is frustrated that it is not happening as quickly as he would like it to, as he understands that the depth of the hole that we\xe2\x80\x99re in is unlike anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced in a long, long time.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, too.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve undoubtedly heard some commentators second-guess the choice of using the Oval as the forum, the venue, for the speech.\xc2\xa0 Why was that chosen as opposed to giving the same sort of speech at Fort Bliss?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I obviously was involved in part of that decision.\xc2\xa0 I think there are very few issues that if you look back to the spring of 2003 that have played a bigger role in our recent history than our -- than the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- a tremendous number of men and women served in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 A tremendous number were killed and have been injured as a result of their participation in that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believed that the milestone that we marked on Tuesday, the change in our mission away from a combat role and one to a role of assistance, should be marked in many of the same ways that President Bush marked it in announcing the beginning of combat.</p>\n<p>And I will say this, if -- I read -- obviously read a number of stories.\xc2\xa0 There was an AP story that quoted a number of soldiers that are happy that we have made a transition in a country where some of them served once, twice, three, four times.\xc2\xa0 I think it was important that those that spent their time in Iraq -- some who left friends in Iraq -- deserved the national thanks of their Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, one more.\xc2\xa0 George Mitchell says there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be another round of talks, the 14th and the 15th.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to play a role in that?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to invite some of the principals back here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me double-check on the schedule.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:13 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
