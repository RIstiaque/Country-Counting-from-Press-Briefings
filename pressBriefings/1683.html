Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">2:18 P.M. EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My apologies for being late.\xc2\xa0 Let me just take a second and get set up here.\xc2\xa0 A couple quick announcements before we get started.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke today with Governor Henry of Oklahoma, and both Senators Inhofe and Coburn about the deadly tornadoes that struck there, and passed along his condolences and best wishes to the victims.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Later this afternoon, as many of you know, state transportation officials from nearly every state are here at the White House and speaking with Secretary LaHood.\xc2\xa0 They will be visiting the stakeout location at 3:15 p.m. to discuss infrastructure needs and projects that are ready to go, once a recovery and reinvestment plan is through Congress and signed by the President.\xc2\xa0 So you guys can go out and hear all of them.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And with that, let\'s take a few questions.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Going back to Secretary Geithner\'s announcement yesterday on the bailout, can you talk about why the administration didn\'t realize that the market reaction was going to be so bad, and why there weren\'t more details attached to it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I\'m going to give a broader answer to -- sort of a broader walk-through of the plan.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things I\'ll talk about is that yesterday\'s speech and framework were not designed for a one-day market reaction.\xc2\xa0 I think we can all go back in the both recent and not so recent history and see that one-day announcements have provided positive changes in the market for plans that ultimately turned out to be unsuccessful, just as negative reactions have sometimes been at the forefront of plans that worked.\xc2\xa0 The plan that the Secretary outlined is not designed, though, to take care of the market for one day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Let me walk through just sort of a little bit broader answer on the plan, though.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as many of you know, we\'ve dealt with this for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 This is an enormously complicated problem.\xc2\xa0 And to date, the program that has dealt with many of these bad investments and bad assets has been flawed.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important that as we move forward, that the government is able to follow through on the commitments that it makes.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Secretary Geithner understands that, again, as I said, this is not going to be judged on the one-day market reaction, but instead by what is best for the long-term economic health of America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Understand -- let\'s understand a few things of what the Secretary talked about yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He outlined -- what he outlined was comprehensive.\xc2\xa0 It addresses not simply the needs of banks, but also the financial system in general, as well as the needed access to capital by America\'s businesses and families.\xc2\xa0 It\'s based on transparency and integrity, through a comprehensive scrub of the financial system and a rigorous evaluation of the need in the financial system.\xc2\xa0 And it recognizes that the problem cannot be solved and will not be solved with taxpayer funding alone; that this must work with and for the private sector.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Some of that market reaction may be based on what the plan does not do -- right?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure many in the banking sector had hoped, presumably, that bad assets would be paid for either in an unreasonable way or at an unreasonable value, or that insurance that -- whose cost is borne primarily by the taxpayers but might primarily benefit shareholders isn\'t, in this case, part of that solution.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\'ve counseled many times in my very brief tenure of standing up here not to always judge leaks in the newspaper as fact.\xc2\xa0 I know -- I have no doubt that at some point in this briefing today somebody is going to ask me about Secretary Gates and the decision to send more troops to Afghanistan -- a decision I have counseled that the President has yet to make, despite reading it many times in the newspaper.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that what some people read in the newspaper charged their excitement and expectations up about something that wasn\'t ultimately in a plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly one of them, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just push back just a little bit, I mean, I understand you\'re -- you want to play down the implications of one day in the market.\xc2\xa0 But markets thrive on certainty, and a lot of the commentary yesterday was that there wasn\'t enough certainty, there wasn\'t enough detail in the plan for them to know what it would do.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it is the right thing, but how do they know if they\'re not given a clearer readout?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let\'s again go through -- obviously there are going to be twists and turns in all of this.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s look at some of what the plan addresses and how it focuses on some of the greatest and biggest weaknesses of what we saw beforehand.\xc2\xa0 One, this is predicated on transparency and disclosure in an effort to restore market confidence -- something that everybody criticized the previous plan for lacking.\xc2\xa0 This puts private capital into the system and doesn\'t rely solely or completely on taxpayer funding.</div> <div class="legacy-para">For the very first time, the response is coordinated across each agency in the federal government that regulates the financial system.\xc2\xa0 We are -- the plan evaluates the health and the condition of individual financial institutions, again, to understand what\'s needed, to understand their health, and to ultimately, again, restore that confidence.\xc2\xa0 And primarily, first and foremost, there\'s a dramatic expansion that provides -- that will provide lending for the entities that we know need it most.\xc2\xa0 We all hear horror stories about people with good credit that are looking for a student loan, or for an auto loan, or for a housing or commercial real estate loan that can\'t get access to that capital.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The announcement yesterday expands a program that\'s happening right now at the Fed at a rate of about $200 billion that expands to -- with a fluctuation of -- or with both public and private money, about a trillion dollars\' worth of lending.\xc2\xa0 So I would also say that in terms of detail that that\'s, again, a program that\'s working now and will be expanded.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Secondly, some of the stress tests involved and regulators looking at the health of institutions is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the market certainty that will be provided ultimately is by a plan that is focused not just on yesterday or today, but how do we best stabilize that financial system in the long run.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, this isn\'t something that happened last month or that even took only a year to get us involved in.\xc2\xa0 In pulling -- particularly one aspect of the plan that\'s talked about is pulling bad assets off of balance sheets, which hasn\'t been done, that I know of, with active institutions -- right?\xc2\xa0 We talk about RTC, which was set up largely to divide up bad assets for banks that were closed.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s taken us a while to get to this point.\xc2\xa0 It\'s undoubtedly going to take us some time to get to a system of financial stability.\xc2\xa0 But I think the beginnings of a framework to do just that were outlined yesterday by the Secretary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if I can follow up on Jennifer\'s question, do you feel -- the President said on Monday night in his press conference Secretary Geithner would unveil details the next day.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that -- do you feel that it was ready?\xc2\xa0 Was the plan ready?\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel it was ready?\xc2\xa0 And number two, if so, is he pleased with how it was communicated yesterday and how it was rolled out?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, you\'re not judging me already, are you?\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there\'s a -- again, I think there\'s a tendency to look at simply one measurement of this, and by and large that measurement was a few stock markets.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe --\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a few stock markets that people all over the country are investing in.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, I understand.\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m saying is the plan wasn\'t created, nor do I think it should be judged by a one-day reaction in any of those stock markets.\xc2\xa0 The plan that was outlined was ready.\xc2\xa0 Again, part of what this plan will do will be to consult with those private entities in not just the formation, but the execution of the plan.\xc2\xa0 And those consultations are ongoing.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But again, the -- again, I just hesitate to judge the breadth of this and the comprehensiveness of this based on one day\'s reaction.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s -- I don\'t think that\'s how we judge the health of the financial system and I don\'t think it should be how one judges this plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if you don\'t -- even if you disregard the fall in the market, there was widespread confusion about the plan, period.\xc2\xa0 Is that a result of poor communication, or is that a result of it not -- just all the details not being there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I would ask you to go back and look at all of the news on this, read beyond the larger font and the bigger, bolder print, and dig deep into many of the things that I outlined that were pointed out as big weaknesses in the previous plan that are addressed by what Secretary Geithner said yesterday -- a plan that\'s based on transparency and disclosure; something that works with the private markets and understands that the taxpayers alone can\'t do all of this work; that coordinates among the agencies that are involved; that evaluates the financial health of the system and the individual banks, and does so by greatly expanding a program that we think will help provide credit to families and businesses and to people looking to buy homes right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think if you look through this you\'ll find -- you\'ll undoubtedly find, as I said, some disappointment by people that had hoped that there would be some large big bank announced that would take up in one fell swoop everything that had been wrong with the system over the course of several years and wipe it away overnight.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President was very clear yesterday in saying there\'s no easy way out of this.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no easy way out of this for the country, and there\'s also no easy way out of this for Wall Street.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jake.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President this morning, Robert, talked about the fact that the CEO of Caterpillar had praised the idea of a stimulus package, and how the company had recently announced 20,000 layoffs and if the stimulus package passes, they\'ll be able to rehire some of those people.\xc2\xa0 And the CEO, according to local press in Peoria, is going to deliver that message to the President tomorrow, although I guess the President already got it somehow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Text.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He texted it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he is on the recovery board, right?\xc2\xa0 I guess two things.\xc2\xa0 Caterpillar has also opposed the "buy American" provisions in the stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 Recently a spokesman for Caterpillar said that they were like snake oil.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the final package is still being finalized.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering, that, and the fact that Caterpillar -- probably one of the companies that most supports the Colombia free trade agreement, and says that the stalling of that on Capitol Hill -- and I believe the President also has expressed concerns about that free trade agreement -- that that stalling is basically sending a message to businesses in Colombia, please buy Canadian products, not American.\xc2\xa0 Does Caterpillar\'s support for the Colombian free trade agreement and opposition to the "Buy American" provisions, under the same idea of what\'s good for their workers and good business, would that have any effect on the President\'s thinking?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On those two issues?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Colombia and "Buy American."</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d certainly -- I\'ll talk to the President about that.\xc2\xa0 I think his concerns with the Colombian free trade agreement and -- as it relates to labor and environmental standards being a core part of those agreements -- I think have been laid out extensively in the campaign.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously you heard the President speak about a week ago about ensuring that, while we have strong "Buy American" laws on our books that should be heeded as the law, they\'re also -- they also have to be done in a way, in this bill -- the provision has to be done in a way so as not to spark a larger trade disagreement at a time of economic peril.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s why the provisions that were in I believe the Senate legislation ultimately included those -- a strong provision to "Buy American," but also to do that in a way that didn\'t violate existing trade agreements.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President believed that that was a necessary and positive compromise that allowed those provisions to be in the bill, and I presume that, without speaking directly for Caterpillar, that they found that to be a positive development, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">They did communicate to the White House a reevaluation of their employment situation based on what they see as a big investment that could be coming shortly to put Americans back to work and to put, particularly, those workers in Peoria and downstate Illinois area, in particular, back to work.\xc2\xa0 We\'re encouraged by that development.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President today at an infrastructure project in Northern Virginia, that with the right kind of plan presumably is something that can -- phases three and four of that project can begin work and put people back to work.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think in many ways we are hopeful that businesses across this country, in particular, will evaluate the positive impacts of a recovery and reinvestment plan and hopefully plan their businesses accordingly.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve certainly seen alternative energy companies, wind developers that have taken positively to what potentially could be in a final agreement.\xc2\xa0 We hope that that\'s also true for construction companies like Caterpillar, and it\'s why we believe that with the right plan we can get this economy moving again by putting people back to work quickly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t the Colombia free trade agreement, since that\'s not like -- unlike some other past trade agreements, that\'s not one that American workers are necessarily worried about costing American jobs -- opposition to it has more to do with human rights and Colombia and environmental concerns -- wouldn\'t rethinking that free trade agreement, given the state of this economy, also be a logical step?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I don\'t want to do is conflate the reinvestment and recovery plan directly with the President\'s thinking on an individual trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think the concerns that he and others have are still valid around that trade agreement, and we certainly don\'t want discussions on that to get in the way of a recovery or reinvestment plan moving ahead quickly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Ed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what -- the reports on the Hill are suggesting that they\'re pretty close to a final deal.\xc2\xa0 The President had Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 You haven\'t given us a readout on that yet.\xc2\xa0 How did that meeting go?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the level of the President\'s involvement?\xc2\xa0 Is he working the phones?\xc2\xa0 Is he -- you know, what\'s he doing to push beyond his public speeches?\xc2\xa0 And are you encouraged by what you\'re hearing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'ve watched some of the remarks from people involved directly in the negotiations, and I am, like them, reticent to read out minute by minute what is going on.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said this and I\'ll continue to say that the White House believes we\'re making -- taking steps to make good progress toward a final solution on this recovery plan that will have a positive impact on our economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'re certainly hopeful, as we have been throughout this process, to get it done quickly.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether that announcement is today or soon, but we\'re certainly hopeful.\xc2\xa0 It appears as if we\'ve got -- again, we\'ve got Democrats and Republicans working together to get an agreement moved forward.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'ve, quite frankly, always been hopeful about this process.\xc2\xa0 We think enormous progress in a very short period of time has been made, getting it through the House and, as the President announced during the town hall meeting yesterday, getting it through the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 I think that that progress continues.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you guys know that members of our budget team were up on Capitol Hill late last night, as was our Chief of Staff, hoping to get an agreement quickly for the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Geithner, you said before you\'ve got to get past the headlines and the bold type and look at the details.\xc2\xa0 Barney Frank, a key Democrat, is saying that he\'s disappointed that there was nothing on the housing crisis in this rollout.\xc2\xa0 Where is your plan?\xc2\xa0 I mean, every economist across the board says housing is at the root of this.\xc2\xa0 People -- thousands of people every week are being thrown out of their homes.\xc2\xa0 Where is your plan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thousands of people every day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where\'s your plan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said yesterday in visiting the location that was -- that had the highest rate of home foreclosure of any area in the country last year, that that likely was coming very soon.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I agree wholeheartedly with his timetable.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- but you\'ve been in office for a few weeks.\xc2\xa0 Now, I know it\'s still early --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Almost -- almost four.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So -- but how many times can you keep saying "soon"?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this isn\'t the root of the problem.\xc2\xa0 Why was that not the top priority of the Geithner plan?\xc2\xa0 You know, you\'re saying people wanted a bad bank --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wonder if Jennifer\'s question would have been phrased differently had we focused on one rather than the other.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ve heard the President speak -- if there was one thing and only one thing that we had to be worried about or involved in, the President would be involved in it -- as he is right now.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we\'ve got a recovery and reinvestment plan that has to put people back to work in order to get this economy moving.\xc2\xa0 We have a financial stability package that has to be put in place so that the money that the taxpayers have given and appropriated to deal with this financial system and what\'s wrong with it can be spent differently now than it was before, and restore confidence not just in consumers, I think, but in the way government acts.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Involved in that is also dealing with home foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 There\'s also an entire series of reregulation that the President has been working on because, most of all, you could certainly say regulation -- to ensure that we never find ourselves in this situation again -- being reinstituted is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 There are many legs on this stool, as the President has talked about.\xc2\xa0 The President is working on each and every one of those.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t housing the one that the American people really feel the most, more than --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, if somebody has a house but not a job, my guess is they\'d say a job.\xc2\xa0 If somebody has a job but not a house they might say the home foreclosure.\xc2\xa0 If somebody has lost their job because -- or can\'t get a loan because of something that a CEO did in rigging the system, my sense is they might say regulation.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Or my guess is that millions of people all across this country are struggling with a little bit of each one of these problems.\xc2\xa0 We feel very confident that in the very short period of time that the President has been here that we\'ve made remarkable progress on getting a recovery and reinvestment plan through, a process that we believe will quickly get aid out to the American people.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'ll announce a plan to deal with the rising number of foreclosures that are happening each and every day.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll discuss a financial stability package, not just to prevent or to be rated by the market in one day, but look toward long-term health, as well as begin the process with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to reregulate the financial industry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, if we only had to do one thing, we\'d probably have lighter circles under our eyes and a little bit more of a spring in our step.\xc2\xa0 But my sense is that we\'re working every day -- morning, noon, and night -- to get that -- to get those solutions through Congress and on the President\'s desk and out quickly, more importantly, to the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Chip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Ed\'s first question, we\'re told that the stimulus deal that may be announced pretty soon up on Capitol Hill is unlikely to attract much more, if any, additional Republican support.\xc2\xa0 Is the President at the point now where he\'s saying that he won the election, the American people are behind him, according to the polls, and the Republicans can either support his plan or get out of the way?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s clearly won the election.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- that\'s more based on the occupation of our current real estate.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of what an agreement might look like.\xc2\xa0 You certainly saw members over the weekend, as the Senate struck an agreement, wanting time to evaluate whatever might be in that agreement in order to evaluate their support for it.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t want to -- I certainly don\'t want to get ahead of an agreement and ahead on what others might do to look through that agreement to see whether it\'s something that they can support.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Our hope is that members of Congress from both parties will look through and find a balanced approach that provides some stimulus to the economy that will create jobs and get people working again, put money directly into people\'s pockets, make the necessary long-term investments to ensure our long-term economic growth, and to do so in a way that gives people confidence based on the transparency and accountability that\'s in that legislation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Without getting into or knowing the exact levels of each of those specifics, I think it\'s hard to prejudge what support may or may not happen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking more about his mind-set.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen a change as Republicans have refused to respond to his overtures?\xc2\xa0 Is he now saying, hey, it\'s my way or the highway?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think so at all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we had a Republican congressman with us on Monday.\xc2\xa0 We met a Republican governor in Florida on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 We\'re --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very small numbers, though.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Florida is a pretty big state.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One governor.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are certainly many Republican governors that support it.\xc2\xa0 I think that to look through -- look, there\'s no doubt that people are going to look at who votes for what.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I\'ve said many times, and he has, too, is focused not on what the score is on the outcome, but how many jobs this plan can and will create to put people back to work.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s how people in America are looking at this.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- the people that came and -- came to the town hall meetings and asked the President questions, I think that\'s how they look at it, too.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Individual members of Congress will certainly make up their minds and -- through an evaluation of the specifics of any final agreement.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to change the President\'s reaching out to Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t the first or the last issue that either this White House or Congress will deal with this year.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that outreach is going to continue on any number of issues to ensure that we get some -- we hope to get their support on many things particularly dealing with an economic recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we in the seventh-inning stretch now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I was -- I fear we\'re now past the seventh-inning stretch, and I had -- I had hoped to use these fancy screens, have a little Harry Caray going, but we may have zipped right by the seventh-inning stretch, and just for your own edification, well past last call.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was struck by what you I guess were implying about -- you said some of us are going to ask about comments that Secretary Gates said, or I guess you were saying that they were leaked.\xc2\xa0 But these were --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates said --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President is going to make a decision about --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me make sure --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- troops in Afghanistan in a couple of days, and he said that a couple of days ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he said it yesterday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but -- well, okay, a couple of days --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me be more clear on the point that I was trying to make.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve all read about the decisions that have already been made twice, yet I\'ve already gotten emails today about when the President is going to make the decision he\'s already made twice.\xc2\xa0 My counsel is just to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand -- but the Secretary of Defense, a quote from him -- this is not a leak or an attribution to a source close to the situation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s probe this for a second.\xc2\xa0 What does the Secretary of Defense say?\xc2\xa0 What did he precisely say?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to make a decision in a couple of days.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that is completely accurate.\xc2\xa0 My admonition is take heed in what he says, because many have asked about the ramifications of the decision that have already been made.\xc2\xa0 But the Secretary is saying it\'s coming soon.\xc2\xa0 I agree with him.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that he will -- the President will make this -- will implement -- that this decision gets implemented before he announces the decision to the American people?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think he would want to be in consultation with any families that might be involved in the decision that he makes and as well as members of Congress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel he needs to make a public sort of speech, or say -- explain why he needs to send more troops, or something like that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you can be satisfied that when the President makes the decision and activates that decision, that you\'ll know about the decision as well as the reasoning behind it.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that that\'s very, very important to do.\xc2\xa0 I talked yesterday on the plane about a review process that looks into our policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan that\'s ongoing over the course of the next 60 days or so, to reevaluate where we are.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s all accurate and I think that\'s all very much what the Secretary is working on.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">My last admonition -- if you\'ll look at last week\'s press guidance, you\'ll see Secretary Gates on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 If you wait a week, you\'ll see him again.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has a standing meeting.\xc2\xa0 It normally happens on days -- on Tuesdays.\xc2\xa0 It happens today because we were out of town yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So I guess my only thing is that -- I think you\'ll see Secretary Gates on the schedule throughout the year.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t always mean --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We should not assume that he is telling the Secretary, here\'s my decision on Afghanistan and that\'s happening right now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Since I\'m not in that meeting, I don\'t know what exactly the President will say to him.\xc2\xa0 It\'s likely the topic will come up.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying the meeting isn\'t scheduled simply to deal with this, it\'s part of a standing meeting that the President and his Secretary of Defense have.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Totally off topic, what\'s the decision behind having the First Lady participate in a Vogue cover shoot?\xc2\xa0 Should we read anything into her role --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'ll be surprised to know I\'m not a subscriber.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is her -- what does this say about the role she wants to play as First Lady?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think many people, myself included, are enormously proud of the First Lady.\xc2\xa0 I think that throughout the campaign she expressed interest in issues like the work/family balance, something that she and the President have dealt with over the course of their marriage and with children, as many of us deal with.\xc2\xa0 She\'s also been very involved in issues about military families, which I anticipate her continuing.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\'t think any one thing or one interview speaks definitively about the First Lady.\xc2\xa0 I think -- obviously the President is and we\'re enormously proud of who she is and what she represents and the issues that she\'s going to continue to be involved in -- chief among them, as a mother, in ensuring that the girls have a routine that, in an otherwise fairly insane process, has kept them very normal and very rooted.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jonathan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, a lot of people on Wall Street I think would agree with you on your assessment that much of the selling yesterday was because there were things that were not announced yesterday they expect --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to Ed after this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they would say that the reason -- much of the speculation over this was because of the White House\'s over-zealousness and fear of leaks and that your -- you did not collaborate, you did not talk to them about what you were doing and what you were going to come up with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t talk to who?\xc2\xa0 Wall Street?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wall Street.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President feels -- feels, as well as the Secretary and his economic team, we have -- feel comfortable with having reached out.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the collaboration involved continues.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to decide not to give part of my -- the answer that I\'d originally constructed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say what you were just thinking?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you guys could see the bubble box, you\'ll know that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can\'t write it down unless you say it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I\'m not going to say it.\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think that the people that have been involved in the creation of the plan that the Secretary outlined yesterday, throughout the agencies in this government that have to coordinate the response -- the federal response to financial stability, would say that the outreach has been quite vigorous.\xc2\xa0 People have been involved in both -- that work in both government and in the private sector.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the transparency involved continues on our side, the collaboration with the private sector.\xc2\xa0 Obviously one of the strengths of the plan involves an understanding that it\'s not just taxpayer money, it\'s private money, as well, that\'s going to help solve this problem, and that collaboration will continue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you simultaneously say you have been transparent and you took a lot of people on Wall Street by surprise?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I said was that I think some of what was put out there may not altogether have been true -- right?\xc2\xa0 Many people that -- I know people that have talked to me always got counseled -- I\'ve said it any number of times from this podium -- to be very leery and very careful about policy before it\'s announced.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve certainly said that enough to turn blue in the face.\xc2\xa0 It\'s my admonition yesterday and today -- and sometimes expectations based on something that\'s in the newspaper or on cable television that isn\'t true may inflate expectations about what may or may not happen, or what won\'t happen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Do I think some of those market expectations happen?\xc2\xa0 Probably.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt that there was also a psychology involved, as I said, about a hope and a wish that something would -- bad assets would be paid for in an unreasonable way may also have inflated some of those expectations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But again, I think that brings me back to my first answer with Jennifer, which is, I think it\'s important not to look at a market reaction over the course of one or even several days, but the horizon in which -- the financial and economic team look at this not based on some set time period, but what in the long term will help the health of our economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I interrupt you for just a second.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid has announced that there was a deal on the stimulus package.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would like to announce -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 If I can read your BlackBerry, I might be able to give you some --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We all have it.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, there you go.\xc2\xa0 And you guys are in here listening to me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Hopefully when I\'m far better briefed on the announcement that Ms. Loven just made, I\'ll have a far better reaction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you have a statement or something, Robert?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Soon.\xc2\xa0 Once these guys -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to Caterpillar for just a moment?\xc2\xa0 You said that Caterpillar had communicated to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Did Chairman Owens call here or did the President speak to him --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s talked to the Secretary of Transportation, but I will look -- I\'ll figure that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talked to Ray LaHood?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I believe that\'s right.\xc2\xa0 Ray -- obviously Secretary LaHood was -- represented a constituent for quite some time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And will CEO Owens be going out on Air Force One?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\'s traveling on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 We expect him to be there.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll check on</div> <div class="legacy-para">--</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Peoria paper says he will.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the Journal Star is a paper I read and believe.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Come on.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t get all thin-skinned now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just -- you made their new ad campaign.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m for it.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll pose for the picture.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I check on just one more thing?\xc2\xa0 The -- on the jobs numbers -- the President last month was using the figure usually "up to 4 million" created under stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Today he used "more than 3 million" at the construction site.\xc2\xa0 Is there any significance to that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t -- I admit I did not watch the remarks as the President said them, but will certainly look at that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Foreign policy question, Robert. \xc2\xa0How does the administration evaluate news from Israel about the election there?\xc2\xa0 And does it have any appraisal so far on what it might mean for the future of Envoy Mitchell\'s trips and negotiations?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously we congratulate the Israelis on another successful election.\xc2\xa0 Obviously all of the votes have not finally been counted.\xc2\xa0 President Obama looks forward to working with whoever makes up that next Israeli government in a search for lasting and durable peace in the region.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Like our own democracy, I think whether it\'s turbulent or tumultuous times, or bad weather, did not seem to deter millions from voting yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the sign and strength of a strong democracy.\xc2\xa0 But until we see something more definitive, it\'s hard to -- hard to talk specifics, except to say that the President, as you\'ve heard him say many times, is anxious to work with Israel and those in the region to form that lasting, endurable peace.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about Secretary Geithner\'s presentation yesterday?\xc2\xa0 You said one of the things that may have driven the market reaction was the wrong impression that the government would pay in an unreasonable way an unreasonable value for certain assets.\xc2\xa0 But Secretary Geithner has said that he doesn\'t yet know, nor does the Treasury Department know, how to value those assets.\xc2\xa0 So how can you be sure that the government is not eventually going to pay an unreasonable way -- or an unreasonable value for assets?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And how would you evaluate the criticism that what happened yesterday delayed an inevitable reckoning that this government and the American taxpayers are going to have to make with the financial systems that are, if not drowning, sufficiently held back by toxic assets?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first question, obviously I think that\'s why consultations continue with the private sector and with financial institutions as we move forward on this stabilization plan.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve all read stories, and I won\'t get into the technical details because, to use your water analogy, I\'ll be swimming in a deeper pool than I can see the bottom of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But we\'ve all talked and Elizabeth Warren\'s report makes mention of the perils of overpaying.\xc2\xa0 Look, if you overpay, from the government\'s side, the taxpayers lose.\xc2\xa0 If you underpay, from the bank\'s perspective, you create a whole series of problems there.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think that\'s why it\'s important that as we move forward that that collaboration continues, to ensure that a solution involving the removal of bad assets is done in a way that makes sense for banks and taxpayers, not something that maybe we could say happened in the beginning of a very complicated program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of your second question, which had to do with, I think, if I\'m not mistaken, had to do with sort of what\'s next after this money, the President and his economic team believe that it\'s important to restore confidence in our government and our financial system through restoring confidence in the way this program works.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, the taxpayers have -- in September Congress appropriated $700 billion in taxpayer money.\xc2\xa0 Half of that the Congress voted on before this President was sworn in; $350 billion obviously is a huge chunk of money.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important that the President and his economic team signal to all that are listening that the way that this money is going to be spent will be different than the original $350 billion was spent -- to do it in a way that\'s transparent, to ensure that that lending gets to the families and the businesses that need it.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">You heard the President talk -- and many hailed regulations dealing with executive -- excessive executive compensation and the activities of some banks in how they\'ve used some of that money.\xc2\xa0 And I think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that the easier part of this equation -- that executive compensation?\xc2\xa0 It attracts a certain amount of attention, but these other tricky details are much more complicated to unravel?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would agree with that because I don\'t make $18 million a year.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- as I said, I think this is an enormously complicated program.\xc2\xa0 I know there is a sense of wanting to get to what\'s next before we get -- or what\'s next after what\'s next.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\'s important -- our financial team certainly believes that it\'s important that the money that is -- that Congress and the taxpayers have appropriated and approved is spent wisely and differently than the money that was spent before that.\xc2\xa0 Again, $350 billion is an enormous sum of money, and it\'s imperative that we get that spending right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President confident that Hilda Solis\'s nomination to be Labor Secretary will get back on track?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned about the delays?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s not.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully that process will continue through the committee today and hopefully on to the floor soon, and she\'ll be sworn in as the next Secretary of Labor.\xc2\xa0 The President has confidence in her ability to continue the Department\'s mission, and I think that that process will hopefully conclude quickly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wanted to go back to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 How urgently does the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- with great trepidation.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How urgently does the President see the need -- I mean, he said that he wants to send two additional brigades.\xc2\xa0 How urgently does he see the need to get those two brigades there quickly, particularly in light of what happened in Kabul today, and the continued disarray in the country?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what happened today underscores two things.\xc2\xa0 It underscores the security environment with which our forces and Afghanistan forces -- the environment in which they operate in.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re reminded today of the brutal tactics that extremists like the Taliban wish to employ.\xc2\xa0 It hardens our resolve, but it also hardens our resolve to get the next steps in Afghanistan right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">To go back to the attacks for a minute, I think the -- as the President said in his inaugural address, that we will not be judged by what we tear down, but by what we build up -- I think it\'s obvious that the Taliban are interested only in tearing down -- but believes that a renewed coalition will be focused on building up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Having said that, again, it\'s imperative that we get the review process done correctly; that we understand that, as the President has said in dealing with Iraq, there\'s not a -- there\'s not only a military solution to this problem, that we\'re going to have to have renewed diplomatic resources, that we\'re going to have to look at the way we do construction, and all of that is encompassed in the larger review.\xc2\xa0 The security situation remains dangerous, and one that this representative is focused on getting right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not saying that he would wait until this review is completed before he decides on the immediate --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the review encompasses more than just a military decision.\xc2\xa0 It involves any number of things, as well as dealing with Pakistan and the many issues that go along with that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Robert, one more on Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 Again today he was refusing to even estimate how much more money is going to be involved.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?\xc2\xa0 Surely there must -- and I realize you guys have only been in office for a few weeks -- but surely there must be some floor that you\'re operating with, that you know it\'s going to be at least a certain amount of money.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\'s important and what he outlined yesterday was a series of what he called stress tests to underscore and to evaluate exactly what\'s needed.\xc2\xa0 I think you could make a fair summation that we may not entirely know all of the property lines of what we\'re dealing with.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously we\'ve seen -- banks may or may not trust each other in lending from bank to bank.\xc2\xa0 And a very important process in this plan, to do so transparently but also to do so in a way that restores confidence, is to look deeply into each of these financial institutions and figure out what\'s on their books, what they may need in order to begin to get credit flowing again to businesses and families.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s a very important step in this process and one that shouldn\'t be given short shrift in order to, again, simply get to what\'s next after what\'s next.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Surely there\'s some internal estimates that he and the others are operating with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think rather than guessing, it\'s important, and the financial team believes it\'s important, to get that right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, Ann.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on stimulus, why would the President be willing to scale back the tax cut that he promised for the middle class during the campaign now that they\'ve announced a deal up on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 What would his reason be?\xc2\xa0 Just to compromise?\xc2\xa0 Everybody has to give a little?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President obviously campaigned on ensuring that we put money directly back into the pockets of many middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s accurate to say -- and you could ask probably many members of the House and probably 61 -- at least 61 senators, they may -- and particularly one President -- they may have written something slightly different, but, as the President said, let\'s not make the perfect the enemy of what\'s absolutely necessary now.\xc2\xa0 This President, without having seen the details -- caveat -- this President believes strongly that we have to get a plan through Congress and to his desk so that we can get that help out to the American people.\xc2\xa0 So I think, without, again, not having seen what\'s in the final outlines of this, the President isn\'t going to let the perfect stand in the way of what he thinks has to happen right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we hear from him this afternoon?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s entirely possible.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m up here a little on the high wire without knowing all the news.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the note say?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bill says he\'s worried the mess is going to close before we finish briefing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Mara.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You keep on saying that we can\'t get to the next step before we finish this step.\xc2\xa0 And the main question about Geithner --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On any number of questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For any number of -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the questions about the Geithner plan are not so much, well, what are you going to do next; are you going to ask for more money?\xc2\xa0 But he still hasn\'t answered the preliminary questions:\xc2\xa0 How are you going to -- what is the plan by which you\'re going to take these toxic assets of banks?\xc2\xa0 And he says, you know, he doesn\'t want to talk about them until he\'s figured out the structure.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is really, really difficult.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of when you think that very crucial piece of information is going to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\'s -- it\'s something that, in collaboration with the public and the private sector, they\'ll continue to work through.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The reason I answered the question about what\'s next is, many of you have asked.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, no, no, I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But yesterday the problem with Geithner was just that people were expecting some details they didn\'t get, not so much about --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would -- as I said earlier, I would point out to you I think that we learned quite a bit yesterday about what the next steps are going to be.\xc2\xa0 We learned about a very comprehensive plan that will focus not just on one aspect of this but in totality.\xc2\xa0 It will do it in a transparent way.\xc2\xa0 And I won\'t go through all of what I said earlier.\xc2\xa0 Many of these steps -- the lending program that we\'re going to expand is up and running.\xc2\xa0 Some of the evaluations of financial institutions are in the process of beginning to take place.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I think that if you look through much of the coverage, you\'ll find a lot to like about what people have said about this plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one follow-up, which is, you\'re right in saying that this plan shouldn\'t be judged by a one-day market reaction, but one of the things that is really going to affect your ability to reboot the economy is the price that people who buy our debt demand in return for investing in it.\xc2\xa0 And long-term Treasury bonds are going up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to -- that has the potential to choke off the recovery and stop mortgage rates from going down.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering how concerned you are about that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- again, I think that\'s why we have to get this thing right for the long term.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are -- as I\'ve said, it\'s enormously complicated.\xc2\xa0 And within each aspect of this, there are many, many moving parts.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think Ed\'s question was enormously fair.\xc2\xa0 Obviously home foreclosures is something on the minds of millions of people.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s something that we\'re working through and working on.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, the administration takes the long view of what can we do in order to ensure the long-term economic health and economic growth of this economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what -- that\'s the work that continues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the process of the conference committee, during the campaign the website had an ethics pledge that said that Obama would work to reform congressional rules, to require all legislative sessions, including committee markups and conference committees, to be conducted in public, and that would enable the American people to hold their leaders accountable for wasteful spending.\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\'t this conference committee done in that way?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look at what you\'re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I don\'t know what the Congress has done.\xc2\xa0 Obviously some of that might have been enormously helpful to what we were just asked.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Republicans are charging -- and I think accurately so -- that a lot of the discussions were behind closed doors, that a lot of this --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think a lot of those discussions behind closed doors have involved Republicans.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve happened behind those closed doors here; they\'ve happened behind large wooden closed doors on Capitol Hill.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What difference does it make if it\'s Republicans?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the question was about Republicans, so that\'s specifically what I\'m --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, it\'s about the public\'s right to know and observe the process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I encourage you to ask many members of Congress the question that you posed to me.\xc2\xa0 I\'m addressing simply the larger notion of whether or not, in your follow-up question, whether Republicans have been consulted.\xc2\xa0 I think they have, and I think many have said that they\'ve seen and talked with the President more in this administration than they have in previous administrations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the question is, would the President like to see these conference meetings open, whether they\'re Republican --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President would like to see -- and the Press Secretary would like to see the outlines of a purported agreement that has been signed off on so that I can get you appropriate reaction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Peter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- answer the question.\xc2\xa0 The question was on the process.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more than what I gave you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you talk a little bit about the role that Rahm Emanuel and other administration officials are playing on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 What message are they conveying?\xc2\xa0 Are they talking about the size of the package, about the tone of package?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re a little out of what I -- what I know coming up here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Rahm and others on the team -- Peter Orszag, Rob Nabors, Phil Schiliro -- spent a lot of time up on Capitol Hill last night.\xc2\xa0 I have not gotten a full download on all the negotiations last night and what we have, or where we are, up to date at this point.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously the team and the President are -- want to focus on getting something done, getting it done in a bipartisan way with leaders on both sides of Capitol Hill so we can get some help to the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Hopefully we\'ll have a little bit more for you when I get the confines of what we\'re looking through.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you read the note now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s -- you\'d be bored by the note.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 First?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In President Kennedy\'s first press conference in 1961, he announced 37 questions -- he answered 37 questions in 40 minutes.\xc2\xa0 My question:\xc2\xa0 Will President Obama study this transcript?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I can only imagine that if -- Lester, if -- I can only imagine that the next day I\'m sure the embattled press secretary probably wondered -- or was asked aloud at the sheer lack of detail involved by the President\'s quickly running through 37 questions in just over 40 minutes on national television.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m empathetic with many of those questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President believe that the First Amendment can be upheld if the so-called Fairness Doctrine is reinstated and applied only to electronic media and not to any newspapers, magazines, and wire services?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Les, I pledge to you to study up on the Fairness Doctrine so that one day I might give you a more fulsome answer -- even after 37 questions in 40 minutes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.
