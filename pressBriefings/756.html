EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 It is fantastic to have you here.\xc2\xa0 I know you all covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech -- State of the Union Address last night.\xc2\xa0 As I think you might expect, we believe the speech went off very well and has been received very well.\xc2\xa0 And as is tradition, the President is traveling the day after the State of the Union to amplify some of the aspects of his agenda that he talked about last night.</p>\n<p>Today, his focus will be on the need to continue the trend towards a reinvigorated manufacturing sector in this country, and the measures we can take to push that trend forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For that reason, I have with me today the Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, your friend and mine, Jason Furman, who I will turn this over to, to discuss today\xe2\x80\x99s business.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So one of the important questions the President posed in the State of the Union is what are we going to do to make America a magnet for jobs.\xc2\xa0 An important part of that answer is manufacturing in America, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will be highlighting today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to Linamar Plant -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a Canadian company that has four U.S. manufacturing facilities.\xc2\xa0 They announced that this one was opening in 2011 to make parts for Caterpillar and other trucks.\xc2\xa0 They employ 160 workers.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hiring another 40 at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is emblematic of the trend of insourcing that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the United States, in part due to the trained workers we have here in our country, the cost advantages we have in things like electricity because of our abundant natural gas, and our abilities as an exporter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because of all of that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 500,000 jobs added in manufacturing in the last three years.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to not just rest on that, but see what we can do to push it forward and accelerate the pace of job creation.\xc2\xa0 And I think you have the fact sheet which goes through a whole range of them.\xc2\xa0 Gene Sperling will be doing a detailed on-the-record briefing later.\xc2\xa0 But I wanted highlight in particular three things that the President will be talking about today.</p>\n<p>One is national manufacturing institutes.\xc2\xa0 He announced one in Youngsville, Ohio last summer on -- Youngstown, Ohio -- thank you -- last summer, that focuses on 3-D printing.\xc2\xa0 In the State of the Union last night he said that this year we\xe2\x80\x99ll be setting up three more; that\xe2\x80\x99s by pulling and using our existing resources.\xc2\xa0 In addition, he would like Congress to pass another trillion -- a billion dollars to set up 15 more of those institutes around the country.</p>\n<p>Second is corporate tax reform, which would lower tax rates overall, particularly lower them for manufacturing down to a tax rate of 25 percent.\xc2\xa0 And that would be paid for by broadening the tax-based structural reforms and reducing the incentive to locate production and profits overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then finally, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be highlighting things that you can do for manufacturing communities in America, including a $113 million competition that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be proposing for manufacturing communities, and on the SelectUSA initiative which helps people locate in America.</p>\n<p>Just very briefly, on paying for all of this -- because I think this is an example of how everything within the speech was paid for as part of a plan that not only pays for them but would also reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Some of it is existing money, like the three manufacturing institutes.\xc2\xa0 Some of it is discretionary proposals, like the manufacturing communities that would be paid for within the overall caps in the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 So in our budget you will see a bunch of things go down and some things go up, and it adds up to the caps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then the $1 billion from manufacturing institutes is what is called a mandatory initiative.\xc2\xa0 And just to put context on that, the last budget the President put forward had over $1.5 trillion in revenue and mandatory savings.\xc2\xa0 Our next budget will have additional mandatory savings -- additional savings initiatives on top of those that will more than pay for the much smaller cost of initiatives like this and the other ones he talked about in the State of the Union.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So with that, questions for Jason or me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the spending that you hope Congress will buy into from the manufacturing institutes particularly, and the infrastructure program -- it seems like the President may have proposed elements of this before, and Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to fund it.\xc2\xa0 What is your strategy this time for sort of getting Congress\'s approval on this strategy?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I can start, and if Jay wants to add.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President is not new to the topics of manufacturing, infrastructure, energy; he\'s been pushing them for four years.\xc2\xa0 He\'s accomplished things in all of those areas, and some of these proposals are new and re-tooled proposals -- things like infrastructure, an emphasis on \xe2\x80\x9cFix-It-First\xe2\x80\x9d, which is very consistent with what experts across the political spectrum think is how we should be spending our money.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Part of what he was doing was going out last night and arguing his case for all of this.\xc2\xa0 And these are really areas where we have seen, again, outside of the Congress and to some degree inside of Congress, Democrats and Republicans support these types of ideas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact remains that these ideas didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass the last time.\xc2\xa0 What\'s changed to make them pass this time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me try this.\xc2\xa0 Look, if you have the right proposal that has broad-based support, that is proven to be effective, you have to keep pushing it and fighting for it.\xc2\xa0 As Jason just noted, there is considerable support in the business community and in the public at large for these kinds of measures to improve the manufacturing sector\'s prospects.\xc2\xa0 It makes a great deal of sense to do what the President is proposing -- not just because of the immediate effect on our growth and job creation, but because of the long-term need to build a powerful foundation for our economy in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>If this President or any leader approached these challenges with an attitude of, well, this is going to be hard so I won\'t try, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get anything done in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And as you\'ve seen from President Obama over these past four years, he never takes that approach.</p>\n<p>And the fact is everything he proposed last night has had at different times and with different configurations significant bipartisan support, and we expect where Congress has a role to play, Congress will act on this agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would this region or this company benefit from any of the proposals the President talked about last night?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for this particular locale?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is a company that came here because of a lot of the advantages the United States already has, and that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 But certainly something like corporate tax reform that cuts tax rates for companies that are producing things here in America would benefit a company like this.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know what the next set of manufacturing institutes will focus on.\xc2\xa0 That will depend on the applications we get and what ways a company like this would benefit from their technologies.\xc2\xa0 But certainly things like 3-D printing are widely used in manufacturing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And generally, if you look at things like the President\xe2\x80\x99s energy agenda, for example, something like natural gas, that\'s helped bring the price of electricity down -- to bring it down further -- and that matters a lot to the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we have a thought on the Hagel nomination -- where we are with it?\xc2\xa0 Do you still feel confident it\xe2\x80\x99s going to go through?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that the committee voted the nomination out.\xc2\xa0 We hope and expect the full Senate to take action expeditiously to confirm Senator Hagel as the next Secretary of Defense and to fill this vital post in our national security apparatus.</p>\n<p>We know with 100 percent confidence that there is majority support for Senator Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s nomination -- majority and then some.\xc2\xa0 So we ask Congress, the Senate to move quickly to confirm him as Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you map out the travel for the rest of the week?\xc2\xa0 Today is manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s in Georgia and Chicago later this week, what the focus is going to be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The whole issue is not to drive too fast by today\xe2\x80\x99s important visit and the policy focus that comes with it.\xc2\xa0 The travel tomorrow, travel Friday will highlight other elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda.\xc2\xa0 And then, moving forward, we have a lot of business to conduct.\xc2\xa0 And you heard the President\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious agenda last night, and he looks forward to working with Congress and talking to the American people about every aspect of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President in 2008 proposed raising the minimum wage to $9.50.\xc2\xa0 Last night he proposed $9.00.\xc2\xa0 So are Americans able to get by on less now than they would be four years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 An important factor in how the minimum wage proposal was designed was exactly what the President said last night, which is that no one working full-time at the minimum wage should have to raise their children in poverty.\xc2\xa0 And the President takes a comprehensive approach to that.\xc2\xa0 Part of that depends on how much they\'re paid, and part of it depends on things like the tax credits they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten.\xc2\xa0 And the President was able to secure in 2009 and extend most recently in the tax agreement at the beginning of January refundable tax credits for families with children that are worth 75 cents an hour if you work full-time and have two children.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if you think of that extra money, together with the extra money from this minimum wage increase, the two of those together would first of all exceed the minimum wage number he had called for on the campaign, but more importantly at a fundamental level, take you from below the poverty line to above the poverty line for someone working full-time with children.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also add that $9.00 an hour is a robust increase in the minimum wage and would put it at a higher level adjusted for inflation than any time since 1981.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I would just make the point -- because this goes to the question about enacting this agenda and potential obstacles that the President may face -- in 1996, when Newt Gingrich was Speaker of the House, Congress passed an increase in the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 When George Bush -- George W. Bush was President, he supported an increase in the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 It is a bipartisan American principle, the President believes, that no one in the United States should work full-time and live in poverty.\xc2\xa0 The benefits of the hike that the President is proposing are manifold -- economic and social.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that action will be taken in the bipartisan spirit that action has been taken in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether the President watched or read the text of Rubio\'s speech last night and had any reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether he had a chance.\xc2\xa0 He certainly didn\'t watch it.\xc2\xa0 He was on Capitol Hill past the time that Senator Rubio spoke.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to him this morning about it.</p>\n<p>I would say one thing, which is that while the messenger may have changed, the message we heard last night from the Republican Speaker was entirely consistent with the policy ideas that Mitt Romney campaigned on last year that the American people did not support.\xc2\xa0 This was not a focus of his address last night, but I know -- and the President is aware of the fact that Senator Rubio wants to play and is playing an important role in an effort to achieve bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>But aside from that, if you look at the remarks by Senator Rubio last night, they could have been delivered by Governor Romney in their policy essence.\xc2\xa0 And I think what the President was saying last night is we need to move forward on an agenda that builds the middle class; that produces not a bigger government but a smarter government; and that grows the economy while reducing our deficit in a way that\'s fair, that doesn\'t ask senior citizens or middle-class families sending their kids to college, or parents with disabled children to bear the burden solely of reducing our deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s an approach that doesn\'t just have the President\'s support or the Democratic Party\'s support, or even support of independents, which it does.\xc2\xa0 It has support among Republicans out in the real world, and it has support of numerous Republican former elected officials who have led or served on bipartisan commissions who have looked at deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President warned last night of the economic consequences of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Is he -- obviously, he\'s talking manufacturing today, other elements in the State of the Union tomorrow and Friday.\xc2\xa0 But what else is he doing kind of behind the scenes?\xc2\xa0 Is he reaching out to lawmakers?\xc2\xa0 Is he engaging in any conversations to still try and head off the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We at the White House, led by the President, are working with Congress to try to urge them to take action to avert the sequester, the implementation of which would be wholly unnecessary and an arbitrary wound inflicted on our economy at a time when we\'re recovering.\xc2\xa0 And we should be and are poised to be creating jobs and growing further.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Senate is working on a proposal that would buy down the sequester for a relatively short period of time to give Congress the time and space necessary to do what it is setting itself up to do, which is work through in regular order a budget process that hopefully will produce the kind of middle-of-the-road, common sense, balanced deficit reduction that the President seeks and which has the support of the American people.\xc2\xa0 So the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we\'ve heard -- I think I just saw a commentary from Senator McConnell flatly predicting that the sequester will take effect.</p>\n<p>I know that Speaker Boehner has in the past -- and not-so-distant past -- boasted to the Wall Street Journal about the support he has among Republicans in the House to allow the sequester to take effect and the political leverage that will give him -- leverage to achieve political goals.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, what \xe2\x80\x9cleverage\xe2\x80\x9d means in this case is jobs.\xc2\xa0 It\'s people.\xc2\xa0 It\'s tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who suffer or would suffer the consequences of that kind of political gambit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, Jack Lew\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation hearings are today.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to face some questions about his time at Citi, and also an offshore account.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see any conflict in that, that the President spent the campaign sort of rallying against offshore tax havens?\xc2\xa0 And are there any concerns about his confirmation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no concerns about Jack Lew\'s confirmation.\xc2\xa0 He is extraordinarily qualified to be the next Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 And on the matter you raised, I would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, Jack Lew has been confirmed by the Senate to previous posts, and is fully -- all this information about his background was available on those occasions.</p>\n<p>Two, the President campaigned on reforming our tax code so that it rewards companies that invest here, that closes loopholes that are available to the few and not the many.\xc2\xa0 And in that effort, he was aided ably by his Chief of Staff at a policy level, and that was Jack Lew.</p>\n<p>The debate last year wasn\'t about individuals, it was about what policy do you support when it comes to our tax code.\xc2\xa0 The policies the President supports and urges Congress to implement and did again last night are the policies that Jack Lew supports.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re quite different from the policies that, unfortunately, Republicans supported last year and apparently this year as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On tax reform -- I read this morning an analysis, I think from Brookings, that the statements last night were a rejection of the idea of a territorial tax system.\xc2\xa0 Is that an analysis that you would agree with?\xc2\xa0 Is that really what\'s being said here?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that analysis.\xc2\xa0 But just in terms of restating --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I applaud Roberta for in the morning reading think-tank analysis before everyone else.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 But I certainly will make up for that deficiency on my part.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I\'ll just restate where the President is on this, which is the President has rejected a pure territorial system; doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a system in which you face a much lower tax rate on an investment that takes place overseas, rather than an investment that takes place here.\xc2\xa0 But he does recognize that we currently do have a hybrid tax system; that the global competitiveness of our companies is important.\xc2\xa0 They are going to operate all around the world and succeed and compete all around the world, and so wants a hybrid system that would encourage that, but would really toughen up the ways in which right now you, for example, shift profits overseas, avoid paying taxes here.\xc2\xa0 And that leads not just to jobs overseas, but also higher tax rates on our companies here in America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance in the ideas about a tax reform for a repatriation holiday of some type?\xc2\xa0 Maybe tied to job creation?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The administration has really rejected a temporary repatriation holiday.\xc2\xa0 The last time we tried it, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t successful in creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 It cost us a substantial amount of money, and it rewards companies that have put a lot of money in low-tax jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>What we would be willing to work together on is a permanent reform of the tax system that makes it smarter so our companies can be more competitive globally, have less incentive -- more incentive to undertake production here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s that type of longer-term tax reform that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, not these types of one-off repatriation holidays.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You call this trip the traditional day-after-the-State of the Union trip.\xc2\xa0 That actually has not been this President\xe2\x80\x99s tradition.\xc2\xa0 So he has not always gone out the day after the State of the Union to sell the message.\xc2\xa0 So why now?\xc2\xa0 Is it something where he feels he has more he has to sell now?\xc2\xa0 Or does he feel like he has more of an opportunity to get something done now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe we traveled last year.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to look at my travel logs.\xc2\xa0 I think having covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s two predecessors, it is more or less a tradition to travel in the wake of the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s tradition or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe -- as unique and humbling an opportunity it is for a President to be able to speak to Congress, a joint session, and to the nation, as the President did last night, you don\xe2\x80\x99t just do that and stop the conversation.\xc2\xa0 You continue to take your arguments and your case to the people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is doing today, tomorrow and Friday, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he will do throughout his second term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in the briefing room, this is an approach the President believes is the right approach, because the American people have a stake in everything Washington will or won\xe2\x80\x99t do this year.\xc2\xa0 And they have a deep stake in it, and they care about and expect to be engaged in the conversations about what we should do moving forward.</p>\n<p>As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, the President believes that making that case to the American people helps the system and it helps get things done.\xc2\xa0 It is not to the exclusion of working directly with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 We obviously do that all the time.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-pronged strategy, if you will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how can the President do something like expanding preschool to every student in the United States without expecting that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to somehow add to the deficit?\xc2\xa0 And are there specific things he\xe2\x80\x99s saying will be reduced to offset those costs?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 So as I said in my opening, the last budget had over $1.5 trillion of mandatory and revenue savings -- things like reductions in entitlements, closing loopholes.\xc2\xa0 The initiatives he talked about yesterday were at a substantially smaller scale in terms of dollars than that.\xc2\xa0 And, in addition, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in our budget that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have new savings above and beyond what we proposed before, just like we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some new initiatives above and beyond what we proposed before.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll see all the gory details in our budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And part of why you can rest assured on this question is the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on the topic, which is since he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office he\xe2\x80\x99s restored a principle we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had in the previous eight years, which is all of the new long-term initiatives that he\xe2\x80\x99s done -- whether they were small things like healthy foods, or large things like the Affordable Care Act -- have been paid for.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do and more than pay for them while reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more details of that coming up.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear -- that PAYGO principle was abandoned under the previous administration; has been restored under this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night it seemed like the President\xe2\x80\x99s tone as he addressed Congress was sometimes needling them, sometimes chiding them for going to the ribbon-cuttings.\xc2\xa0 Why does the President think that that tone is the helpful tone to strike when addressing Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the last example you used -- I was on the floor, and it was greeted with chuckling, as appropriate.\xc2\xa0 The President is a former member of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He understands how the Congress works.\xc2\xa0 I think his tone last night was one where he, sure, was cajoling and urging Congress to act, but it was one that is entirely consistent with -- thematically with almost every major speech he\xe2\x80\x99s given on domestic and economic policy, dating back to his keynote convention address in 2004 in Boston when he was a mere state senator.</p>\n<p>He called on Republicans and Democrats to come together, because fundamentally we are Americans first before we\xe2\x80\x99re Democrats or Republicans or independents.\xc2\xa0 And as he said in Boston, we may hail from red states or blue states, but we all live in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And reflecting the themes he set out in the inaugural address, he talked about the fact that obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to resolve all our differences.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to disagree on a number of issues, and those disagreements can be based on both sides in principle.\xc2\xa0 But we were sent here -- again, the President saying this -- elected officials were sent to Washington to get the business of the public done.\xc2\xa0 And there are too many urgent challenges not to do that work on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that was the tone the President brought last night that it was -- he was obviously urging Congress to act, but it was one where he was asking to act in concert with Congress on behalf of the people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When\xe2\x80\x99s the budget coming out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted that it will be sometime in March, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a specific date for you.</p>\n<p>Anything else?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when the President talked about strengthening checks and balances on our counterterrorism operations, was he expressing an openness for the ideas that have been floated on Capitol Hill about having some type of a FISA-like drone court?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was not specific about any particular idea.\xc2\xa0 What he was committing himself to is the principle that he has demonstrated throughout this process, which was his desire to ensure that we build the legal architecture behind our counterterrorism efforts so that those efforts reflect not just our national security interests but our values and our legal system, and that we do that in consultation with Congress; that we continue that consultation with Congress and deepen it; and that we make every effort within the restraints of our national security imperatives to be public with the American people about the rationale behind our counterterrorism strategies and the legal justification behind them.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in the actions taken on behalf of the President by senior administration officials in the last several years -- major speeches by John Brennan, by the Attorney General, by others where they have talked quite openly, again, within the parameters allowed by our national security, imperative about our counterterrorism efforts and the legal justification behind them.</p>\n<p>Great to see you all.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t11:09 A.M.
