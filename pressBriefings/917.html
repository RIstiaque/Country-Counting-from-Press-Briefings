EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hi, guys.\xc2\xa0 All right, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give you a readout of the bilat with Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 You saw obviously the communiqu\xc3\xa9 and the briefing from earlier today, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say -- we noted this in the pool report -- that the meetings concluded with all the leaders moving into an adjacent room to watch the end of the Chelsea-Bayern Munich game.\xc2\xa0 They watched the entire penalty kick series unfold.\xc2\xa0 And the President was able to offer his sympathy to Chancellor Merkel when that concluded, as did Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut then, they had a bilateral discussion that continued on a lot of the subjects that they had already discussed, both at the G8 meetings and in some of their side conversations over the course of the G8 Summit.\xc2\xa0 They continued their discussion about the eurozone, and including the emerging consensus for steps that need to be taken to promote growth in the immediate term, even as Europe continues with its plans for fiscal consolidation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they discussed some more -- the meeting that will take place later this week among European leaders, and agreed to stay in touch on issues related to the eurozone and global economy going forward through those meetings and into the G20.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey briefly -- they discussed Iran.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we are in complete alignment with the Germans heading into the next round of P5-plus-1 talks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been coordinating closely with the European Union and the three members -- three European members of the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 And Lady Ashton, who\xe2\x80\x99s the lead negotiator, and the two leaders of course agree that Baghdad is an opportunity for the Iranians and the P5-plus-1 to discuss concrete steps that could be taken to build confidence in the peaceful nature of Iranian program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut then they also discussed Afghanistan in advance of the NATO Summit.\xc2\xa0 They focused on the three areas that will be the focus of the ISAF meeting in Afghanistan, and that is the transition in which ISAF moves into a support role in 2013 on the way to a full transition to Afghan lead in 2014.\xc2\xa0 And they also discussed the Afghan National Security Forces and the enduring support that NATO will provide to the ANSF as well as the Afghan government.</p>\n<p>\n\tGermany, as you may know, recently, at a bilateral meeting between President Karzai and Chancellor Merkel, announced significant long-term support for the ANSF of 150 million euros on the other side of 2014.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an important contribution to the future of sustainment of Afghan security forces and that have reached a similar agreement with Afghanistan as our SPA, in terms of a strategic partnership with Afghanistan beyond 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo on these security issues, Iran and Afghanistan, we really are in lockstep with the Germans.\xc2\xa0 And so it was a good opportunity for them have those conversations before the NATO Summit, the P5-plus-1 talks, and the eurozone meeting later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Merkel seek any assurances from Obama that her fiscal consolidation plans weren\xe2\x80\x99t getting pushed to the sidelines given how much talk there\xe2\x80\x99s been at the summit about the growth agenda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she sought that type of assurance.\xc2\xa0 I think there is an understanding that has been developing over time as this debate has shifted that you can go forward with the fiscal consolidation, and you can have the pact that Chancellor Merkel showed so much leadership in getting around fiscal reforms within the eurozone, while also pursuing steps to promote growth at the same time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, for instance, there is discussion of a growth pact -- not to take the place of the fiscal pact -- but to be taken above and beyond the fiscal reforms.\xc2\xa0 So I think what really we saw here in these discussions is the way in which the debate has evolved, and there is a growing recognition of the need to take steps in the immediate term that can promote growth in the eurozone while managing the crisis around the political situation in Greece and across Europe, and also pursuing the fiscal consolidation that Chancellor Merkel and others have been focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is she part of that growing recognition?\xc2\xa0 And how did she articulate to the President to what extent she\xe2\x80\x99s willing to modify her original stance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again -- I think she is.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her in recent days say that she was certainly open to discussing a growth pact that President Hollande had called for, and she was open to discussing some form of stimulus around Greece.\xc2\xa0 And I think at the discussions over the course of the last two days, the leaders discussed, again, not steps that would take the place of fiscal reforms and structural reforms within the eurozone, but that could be taken on top of that to promote growth and to help stabilize the situation.\xc2\xa0 And also, you see in the communiqu\xc3\xa9, language to the effect and language that recognizes the need to proceed with some flexibility in dealing with the challenges in the eurozone.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think she certainly has been as involved in these issues as any leader in Europe, and is going to continue to be a leader on all these issues.\xc2\xa0 And again, as a part of I think the consensus we saw in the communiqu\xc3\xa9 and in the discussions, that you can do growth and fiscal consolidation on two tracks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No new -- the ball wasn\xe2\x80\x99t advanced in any kind of specific way in this bilat that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to read out here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I actually think that the most consequential discussions about the eurozone really took place in the G8 meeting, the G8 discussion, and the -- some of the side conversations that the leaders had.\xc2\xa0 And they had, frankly, hashed out a lot of these issues in the negotiation in the communiqu\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this was kind of a wrap-up discussion.\xc2\xa0 This was not a discussion to go far beyond what had already been covered over the course of the previous 24 hours or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When she first arrived he indicated that he understood she had a lot on her plate.\xc2\xa0 Was there any sense in the meeting -- did she vent any frustration at feeling isolated at this meeting with everybody emphasizing growth?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- look, as I said earlier, I think obviously she\xe2\x80\x99s had a lot on her plate with the situation in the eurozone, her first meeting with President Hollande, and then she had a huge public meeting in Germany the day she flew out.\xc2\xa0 And then, frankly, to her credit -- the credit of the other European leaders, they had a very long day yesterday on their European clock because they were up well into the night, which was early morning hours their time.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think what the President underscored is just how much leadership Germany plays within the eurozone, and that there is an extraordinary responsibility that they have carried through all of these steps over the course of the last two and a half years.\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel has been at the center of that, which is going to be going forward as we head into the talks later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think there is a recognition of a leadership role that Germany plays in the eurozone.\xc2\xa0 And there is a sense that these new leaders, Prime Minister Monti and now President Hollande, have gotten off to a good start.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was a big part of what was accomplished at the G8.\xc2\xa0 This group of leaders has never met before.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve never had this particular collection -- sit down and get at these global economic issues, and to do so at a critical juncture.\xc2\xa0 And I think that provides a basis going forward for their talks later this week and then for the G20 next month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How detailed was their discussion of Greece?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Greece certainly came up.\xc2\xa0 And they I think reflected what\'s in the communiqu\xc3\xa9, which is, there is an interest in keeping Greece in the eurozone as they go through with their commitments.\xc2\xa0 And I think they discussed steps that can be taken to support that objective, and recognize that Greece has its own political process to work through in the next month.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said in his statement, the Greek people are going through very difficult times.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I think it\'s the President\'s belief and the Chancellor\'s belief that the Europeans have the capability to deal with this challenge; that they can build on the work that they\'ve already done by taking additional steps around growth and stabilizing the situation in the eurozone.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s confident that they\'ll do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long was their bilat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think it was 45 minutes, roughly.\xc2\xa0 And again, they had had -- they had spent a lot of time together already throughout the course of the summit.\xc2\xa0 So it was really an opportunity for them to just wrap up together and to kind of recognize all the work that had been done at the G8, and again, the role Germany plays in the eurozone, but also to look ahead to two big security events -- the NATO summit on Afghanistan and the P5-plus-1 talks and Iran, where Germany has really been a critical partner with us that\xe2\x80\x99s been in total lockstep.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Merkel ask for the bilat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Actually, they had discussed for some time being able to get together at this -- at the G8.\xc2\xa0 And we actually -- remembering that when the President talked to her while she was on vacation I think recently, they discussed it would be very good to get together on their own, on the sidelines of the G8.\xc2\xa0 And so it was a matter of just finding the time.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, the G8 schedule was so booked that the time we found was on the other end of the G8.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could we just switch to NATO, quickly?\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to get your sense of where things stand with Pakistan and reopening the supply route, and if there\'s any chance at this point that Obama and Zardari will meet separately on the sidelines of the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any plans for a bilateral meeting with President Zardari.\xc2\xa0 The only bilateral meeting we have scheduled is with President Karzai tomorrow morning, and then they\xe2\x80\x99re in the summit sessions.\xc2\xa0 President Zardari will of course be in the ISAF session.\xc2\xa0 And so the President will certainly have a chance to see him and speak to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the supply lines, we believe that this is going to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 There have been positive steps, statements made by the Pakistanis, and we\'re currently negotiating the opening of the supply lines with them; we expect that to take some time.\xc2\xa0 So there is still work to be done through those negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, based on the statements they\xe2\x80\x99ve made and the negotiations that we\'ve started, we believe it\'s going to be accomplished.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s going to happen this weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not anticipating necessarily closing out those negotiations this weekend.\xc2\xa0 A lot of it is happening, frankly, at the working level between our governments.\xc2\xa0 We obviously keep you updated, but it\'s our sense that both sides want to get it done, it will get done.\xc2\xa0 But right now, we\'re in a process of negotiation about how exactly that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that basically why -- I mean, the President really can\'t meet with Zardari until this is formally resolved.\xc2\xa0 Is that why there\'s not a scheduled meeting at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he met with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul when this issue was still in play.\xc2\xa0 So I think it was more a matter of simply, he\'s got a lot of time devoted to chairing these summits.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai, of course, and the Secretary General of NATO, he\'s going to meet with before the summit because it\'s important for them to get aligned as we head into these discussions on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aligned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Aligned, yes.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, we don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate there being any more bilateral meetings.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let you know if that changes, but it\'s a pretty full summit schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President was briefed on the arrests in Chicago?\xc2\xa0 This terrorism plot?\xc2\xa0 And do you know more about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that he has been.\xc2\xa0 I could check on that, but not to my knowledge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that situation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The only comment I\'d make is that, again, there is always -- look, we go and you guys come with us to summits several times a year now, for three and a half years.\xc2\xa0 Every single city we go to there\'s obviously protests and security disruptions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re very confident in the ability of Chicago, together with the United States government, to have a very successful event over the course of the next two days.\xc2\xa0 If these more serious allegations are true, then I think it was effective work in making sure that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pose any additional threat to public security.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll have to wait -- what additional information comes out before getting into the specifics of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got one more.\xc2\xa0 Is there any actual move for a burger outing between the President and Monsieur Hollande?\xc2\xa0 It was mentioned yesterday he wanted to hear what he thought about the burgers in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 Will he get a chance to find out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of a particular hamburger summit on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s opportunities embedded within the menu of the summit, so we\'ll have to keep you abreast of the dinner tomorrow night at Soldier Field.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut actually, I will say that a number of the European leaders -- and I\'ll let them speak to their schedules -- were planning some pretty outings of their own to see the sights in Chicago, to see the architecture.\xc2\xa0 And so I think you\'ll see leaders taking advantage of the great setting of the city of Chicago over the course of the next few days.\xc2\xa0 And again, for some of us here, it\'s a bit of a homecoming, too.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re looking forward to seeing a city that is very close to our hearts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t8:38 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
