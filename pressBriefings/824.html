EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very excited to be headed down to Virginia Beach, part of the state of Virginia that is home to my people; my father grew up in Norfolk.\xc2\xa0 Great part of the state, great part of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The only announcement I have is on what might be the most dominant topic of the week for the vast majority of the American people, and that is the replacement referees.\xc2\xa0 The President is very pleased that the two sides have come together to resolve their differences and ensure that going forward, when we watch our favorite teams play in the NFL, we can focus on the players and the game rather than on the officiating.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great day for America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he mention that in the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect so, but you never know.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Just one thing to highlight.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, overnight, the Obama campaign released a two-minute ad where the President speaks directly to the American people and lays out his plan to keep America moving forward, get folks back to work, and make the middle class secure again.\xc2\xa0 By focusing on manufacturing, energy, education, national security, and a balanced plan to reduce our deficit, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s real and achievable plan will create jobs and expand opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 This ad will run in seven states.\xc2\xa0 You have the list.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to read it or present it to you.</p>\n<p>Also, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him in his remarks today talk about the importance of economic patriotism and making sure the middle class gets a fair shake, a fair chance to continue to -- to make sure the middle class have a fair shot to compete.\xc2\xa0 With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where was that video shot?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, actually.\xc2\xa0 It looks like it might have been the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the other topic of the week.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to meet with Netanyahu tomorrow or anytime soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no scheduling updates.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President was at the United Nations earlier this week in New York.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister was not in New York.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister is there today and tomorrow, I believe.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister is meeting with Secretary of State Clinton later today, this evening, and I expect the President will have a follow-up phone call with the Prime Minister probably Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Benghazi, there still is considerable confusion over what the administration considers the attack on the U.S. consulate.\xc2\xa0 Can you say why the FBI still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get into that crime scene?\xc2\xa0 And how aggressively is the United States looking for clues, and as the President says, bringing them to justice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to refer you to the FBI for specifics about the investigation that they\xe2\x80\x99re leading.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is determined, as he has said many times, that the perpetrators of the attack that cost four American lives, including our ambassador, be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 And he will insist that the agencies of his administration take all necessary action to bring about that eventuality.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President does not call it, label it a terrorist attack as you and others have, is there some legal or diplomatic trigger that that brings?\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he said that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re misunderstanding something here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m the President\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman.\xc2\xa0 When the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, in open testimony in Congress answered a question by saying yes, by the definitions we go by -- this is me paraphrasing -- this was a terrorist attack -- I echoed that, because this President, this administration, everybody looks to the intelligence community for the assessments on this.\xc2\xa0 And it has been since I said so, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that this was a terrorist attack.</p>\n<p>There are broader issues here that the President has addressed in answering questions, and he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously interested in, as we all are, in waiting for the final result of an investigation.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about this.\xc2\xa0 Every step of the way, the information that we have provided to you and the general public about the attack in Benghazi has been based on the best intelligence we\xe2\x80\x99ve had and the assessments of our intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation and that as more facts come out, we will follow those facts wherever they lead and apprise you of our assessments as those facts come to light.</p>\n<p>What has also been the case is that from the very first hours after the attacks and the unrest in Cairo, there has been an attempt, unfortunately, by Republicans, beginning with Governor Romney, to try to turn this event into a partisan issue, to try to score political points out of a terrorist attack that cost the lives of four Americans, including our Ambassador to Libya -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.</p>\n<p>This President is absolutely focused on finding out exactly what happened, who is responsible, and bringing those responsible to justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, could you weigh in on the Romney campaign\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of Obama over how the Benghazi issue has been handled? Any political aspects to that that you see?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think every time Mitt Romney has attempted to dip his toe in foreign policy waters, it\xe2\x80\x99s been an unmitigated disaster.\xc2\xa0 So if you look at the last couple of months -- I know this isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly your question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m getting there -- he went overseas on a foreign trip that was built up, offended our closest ally.\xc2\xa0 He gave a speech that was his best opportunity to lay out his case to the American people on why he was prepared to be commander-in-chief, and he failed to mention our troops, failed to mention Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He jumped the gun in criticizing the President on the night that these tragic events happened, which is something that, as we know, is not traditionally what takes place in a political campaign given the tragedy and the seriousness of what was underway.</p>\n<p>Look, I think the American people are going to look at the President versus Mitt Romney, and look at their records and look at their vision.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very -- from the beginning of his time in the White House he has said, before he went into office, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to end the war in Iraq -- he did that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go after Osama bin Laden -- he is dead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going -- and al Qaeda is decimated.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to restore our place in the world -- he\xe2\x80\x99s done that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how people are going to look at and evaluate the President\xe2\x80\x99s record.</p>\n<p>We know that Mitt Romney wants to change the subject, wants to get at a strength for the President, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you made a point of saying you\xe2\x80\x99re his spokesman and so what you say is policy.\xc2\xa0 But there is a difference in weight when a spokesman says something versus when the President says something.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason that that particular word hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of his mouth?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, no, there is no -- he was simply answering a question and explaining that the matter is under investigation.\xc2\xa0 Again, he bases his judgments on matters like this on the assessments that he\xe2\x80\x99s provided by the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 The head, the director of the NCTC went before Congress and made clear what his views were about how he would describe this, which is that it was a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, I mean, definitionally, what a terrorist attack means, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say it was self-evident when you have an armed assault on a diplomatic facility that results in the death of four Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s definitionally a terrorist attack.</p>\n<p>In terms of the partisan criticism here that has been sort of all over the map, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that key members of the Senate and House in the Republican Party have been briefed by the same intelligence officials that provide intelligence to the administration, to the President, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten the same information.\xc2\xa0 They\'re fully aware of the information that has been developed and what the views were as we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved along since the events of that night in Benghazi -- or that day in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 So it just underscores the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate attempt to politicize something like this.</p>\n<p>What the President is focused on is on bringing those to justice who killed four Americans and ensuring, as he said at his United Nations speech, that our embassies and diplomatic facilities and our diplomatic personnel around the world are being provided the protection by host countries that those countries are obligated to provide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, do you think the President is running ahead in Virginia polls?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we see the same public polls that you all see.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into our internal polls.\xc2\xa0 I will say that we know Virginia is going to be a close race.\xc2\xa0 I would bet that when the Romney team was looking at their scope of states that they probably thought six months ago they might be in a stronger position in Virginia, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very close.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s within the margin of error.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to run regardless of where the polls are in Virginia like we\xe2\x80\x99re five points behind.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re here today.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we will be back, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain, again in the next couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re really focused on our own game plan.</p>\n<p>I will mention that not in Virginia, but today early voting starts in Iowa, early voting is happening in dozens of states across the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Game Day in America -- that\'s not just a play on the refs\xe2\x80\x99 resolution.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a focus of ours as well.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s not applicable to Virginia, but it is part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on -- making sure people know where to vote, how to vote; they can vote early at this stage in the race.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought, Jen, Denise\xe2\x80\x99s road map says that today early voting did start in Virginia.\xc2\xa0 Is that wrong?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absentee voting.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Absentee voting, it may.\xc2\xa0 Early voting does start in Iowa today though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, a quick question.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to this apparently perfectly legal method Romney used to greatly reduce the gift and estate taxes on the wealth he transferred to his children that was reported today?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get back to you on kind of a response to it.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s clear -- that specific report aside -- is that Mitt Romney has not been shy about using tax loopholes and different ways to reduce his own taxes that he\xe2\x80\x99s paying on a yearly basis.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a closer look and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get back to you on a specific response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, how long are you going to keep this run going where President Obama and Governor Romney are in the same state on the same day?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Same moment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we plan our schedule.\xc2\xa0 We all know what the close states, the swing states are.\xc2\xa0 Virginia is certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 Ohio is certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 And you never know, it could happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, what\xe2\x80\x99s the effect of the abbreviated debate prep schedule for the President going to be?\xc2\xa0 How is that going to affect his debate performance next week?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The President will have some time to prepare, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing some studying.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly less than we anticipated because of the events in the Middle East, because of his busy travel schedule, because of just the constraints of governing.\xc2\xa0 So it is less than we originally planned.</p>\n<p>I will just take this opportunity to say that Mitt Romney on the other hand has been preparing earlier and with more focus than any presidential candidate in modern history -- not John F. Kennedy, not President Bill Clinton, not President George Bush, not Ronald Reagan has prepared as much as he has.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that he will have a lead on how prepared he is.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll also say that we fully expect -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- a lot of us have been to this rodeo before; we know there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be twists and turns, and ups and downs in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 We know we\xe2\x80\x99ll have them in the next 40 days as well.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney has set it up that, and his team has set it up that they want the debate to be that moment for him.\xc2\xa0 They fully expect that moment is going to be their turning point.\xc2\xa0 And we know people want to write a comeback kid story, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if that happens.</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to send this to you, too, but John Kerry did receive a bump, a significant bump, when he -- after the debate, as did George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that there\xe2\x80\x99s historical precedent for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all that, what\xe2\x80\x99s the worst thing from the campaign perspective that could happen at the debate for the President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, he could fall off the stage.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen at the debate.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s 90 minutes where there will be a great deal of back and forth.\xc2\xa0 We also feel that Mitt Romney has 90 minutes to explain to the American people exactly how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to fight for the middle class when his plan seems to be to just extend tax cuts for the highest income.\xc2\xa0 He has 90 minutes to give specifics, and so we expect that will be part of the conversation as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an area that you guys think you need to -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re sensitive on, that you need to explain more?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, as much as I\xe2\x80\x99d love to detail our fears, concerns and hopes, I know that it will go straight to our opponent\xe2\x80\x99s deck of papers, so we\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to hold back from previewing our strategy before the debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Romney has suggested that, at the very least, Obama will present untruths about his record at the debate.\xc2\xa0 And some Republicans have suggested that he\xe2\x80\x99ll outright lie.\xc2\xa0 Could you respond to that?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is -- Mitt Romney and his team have a tendency to look at the President and make outrageous accusations about his truthfulness when, if you look at their record of ads, their record of mistruths, his nose would be Pinocchio, from here in Virginia to Ohio if that was part of what happened to Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 That didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to say it one more time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 If Mitt Romney were Pinocchio, his nose would be reaching from Virginia to Ohio, with the number of lies and untruths in the ads that his team has put out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has laid out his plan, the choice in this campaign, the choice in this election for the American people.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll do that next Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 But this is the kind of ridiculous, absurd and unproven accusations by the Romney team that are just meant to distract and are not based on any record of the last several months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay, are you starting to feel like a bystander in these gaggles?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 I enjoy listening to my colleague field your questions.\xc2\xa0 It\'s most comforting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did you cover the \xe2\x80\x9908 debates, any of them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I sure did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you expect to get out of the comparison today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\'s fair to say -- and this is as a former journalist and observer -- I mean, if you just look at the assessment of the debates in 2008, that Barack Obama became the nominee of his party, in some ways in spite of his debate performances, and Mitt Romney became the nominee of his party because of them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- because of Romney\'s debate performances.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, in terms of expectations, reflects my view going in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he doing any work to prepare for Romney potentially trying to get under his skin -- the President?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview what\'s happening or kind of read out what\'s happening in debate prep.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I will say that the President is familiar with his own loquaciousness and his tendency to give long, substantive answers, as is evidenced by his appearance at Univision and also at the NBC Education Nation interview.\xc2\xa0 And that is a challenge when you\'re in a debate and you have a limited amount of time to answer a question, to give feedback, to push back on your opponent\'s answers.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something he and all of us are cognizant of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Air Force One has landed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:19 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
