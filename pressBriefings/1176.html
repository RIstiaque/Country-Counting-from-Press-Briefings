We\xe2\x80\x99re all working off the same number now, $73 billion (inaudible). The appropriations committees met today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference in the composition of that number -- what\xe2\x80\x99s included, what\xe2\x80\x99s not included.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a thorough negotiation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re getting back -- we got to roll up our sleeves.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going back, meeting tomorrow morning at what, 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. -- whatever it is tomorrow morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere is no reason why, with all that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the world and with the state of the economy, we can\xe2\x80\x99t reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown, because the bottom line here is we\xe2\x80\x99re working off the same number.\xc2\xa0 This is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s about how.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd we have very firm -- the Democrats are in full agreement on what we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do in that number.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to eviscerate the ability of the economy to grow.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a little debate.\xc2\xa0 And the negotiation between the appropriators is going on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any detail of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Democrats agree with the President and me, with the administration, on what the makeup of that $73 billion should be.\xc2\xa0 But the key point here is, in my view -- and, by the way there\xe2\x80\x99s no deal until there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole deal.\xc2\xa0 So the composition of the $73 billion makes a big difference.\xc2\xa0 But we are no longer working off $100 billion -- we are at the same place of where -- what number we\xe2\x80\x99re working off, but the composition of that $73 billion. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about riders?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 That is all part of what will be negotiated here.\xc2\xa0 The President and I are not really big on any riders at all.\xc2\xa0 But this is a process which is normal for the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to get into the details.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear what we think are non-starters, both in numbers and riders.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate out here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut the main reason of being here today is to make sure that Democrats in the Senate and the President are both on the same page.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) $73 billion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes.\xc2\xa0 Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the point.\xc2\xa0 The appropriators sat down.\xc2\xa0 Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 and Inouye\xe2\x80\x99s committee sat down and they started off with we\xe2\x80\x99re working off of $73 billion.\xc2\xa0 Now, I spoke to John.\xc2\xa0 John makes it clear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same as our position.\xc2\xa0 There is no deal until there\xe2\x80\x99s a total deal, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo if we do not get the makeup of that $73 billion the way we want it, we may not even be prepared to go that high.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t get the makeup of this, they may argue they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to go -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the makeup of the $73 billion is the equivalent of the riders (inaudible)?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that.\xc2\xa0 Let me be very precise.\xc2\xa0 The makeup(inaudible) everything from discretionary spending to defense, mandatory to non-mandatory, it makes up all of the budget.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it makes up, the totality of what they want to put in the $73 billion and what we want to put in the $73 billion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPart of the negotiation in there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t relate to dollar amounts.\xc2\xa0 It relates to what they will swallow and we could swallow relative to riders.\xc2\xa0 There are certain things we\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to do on riders, even if you agree with everything else.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to do it.\xc2\xa0 They may have positions that are equally as strongly as held.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s not a deal until it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole deal.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
