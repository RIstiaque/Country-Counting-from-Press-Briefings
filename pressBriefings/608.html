Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:14 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your patience.\xc2\xa0 Busy day, as almost every day is here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Before I get to your questions, I had a couple of things I wanted to say to you.\xc2\xa0 And the first is that in front of you and to my left here is Peggy Suntum, who 30 years ago got a phone call.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cShe was set to begin a new job the following day as a White House stenographer, meticulously transcribing the President\xe2\x80\x99s every public utterance.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m reading from a Zeke Miller story, published today on Time Magazine\xe2\x80\x99s website.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe caller informed her that the Marine Barracks in Beirut had been attacked, and that she was needed immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Since then, Peggy, who is a master stenographer, and a wonderful person, and a friend of many of you, has been recording the words of five different Presidents and, unfortunately for her, on occasion, Press Secretaries.\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted to congratulate her on her 30 years and thank her for her service.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>I also have an announcement that on Wednesday, November 20th, President Barack Obama will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\xc2\xa0 The Medal of Freedom is our nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\xc2\xa0 Additional details about the event, including media logistics, will be released at a later date.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the executive order signed by President John F. Kennedy establishing the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the first ceremony bestowing the honor on an inaugural class of 31 recipients.\xc2\xa0 Since that time, more than 500 exceptional individuals from all corners of society have been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>\n<p>And with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a few questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s out there, who the recipients are.\xc2\xa0 There are -- I have to say, it was a distinct pleasure for me to speak with Ben Bradlee about the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be receiving one this year.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On health care, Secretary Sebelius on CNN yesterday said that the President was not aware of any of the problems with the healthcare.gov website before it launched.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to find out since then that there were a bunch of red flags that had popped up before launch.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the President feels now that he should have been made aware of that.\xc2\xa0 Should somebody be held accountable for giving him that information?\xc2\xa0 And if there was somebody giving him information, was he in fact misinformed about the status of the launch?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, thank you for that question.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Sebelius was referring to what I have said and what the President himself has said, which is that while we knew that there would be some glitches, and actually said publicly that we expected some problems, we did not know until the problems manifested themselves after the launch that they would be as significant as they have turned out to be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there was testing and there were some problems anticipated, but we did not expect -- and by we, I mean broadly, the administration, did not expect the scale of problems that we have seen -- which is why, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction and the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s direction, we have launched this all-out effort, 24/7, with a tech surge of experts -- new eyes and ears coming in to assist the existing team -- to identify and isolate each problem that exists with the functionality of the website; assess what the best solutions are to creating a remedy for that specific problem; and then applying it, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s increasing server capacity or writing new code to work around a situation, providing greater accessibility for improvements in the user interface.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are all things that the teams currently operating and working on making improvements to the system are focusing on.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re tackling the problems one by one, they\xe2\x80\x99re prioritizing them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re addressing them.\xc2\xa0 These are technical, logistical problems that require the kind of expertise that\xe2\x80\x99s being brought to bear to fix them.</p>\n<p>But there is no question that we did not anticipate the scale of the problems with the website.\xc2\xa0 What is also important to remember is that the website is not the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 What has been in place since October 1st, and what will be in place for the millions of consumers who want the product, is the vast array of affordable health plans out there because of the marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And every day, more and more Americans are submitting applications, they\xe2\x80\x99re enrolling, they\xe2\x80\x99re shopping, and they\xe2\x80\x99re finding out that they have access to affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re among the 15 to 20 percent of the American people who did not have insurance in the past, they\xe2\x80\x99re discovering that they have options available to them that make it affordable and that will provide them, come January 1st, security that they\xe2\x80\x99ve lacked in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And while the struggles that individuals have had with the website are extremely unfortunate and we take responsibility for them, and we are working around the clock to fix the website, to make that experience easier, those struggles, as I said yesterday, pale in comparison to the uncertainty that a single mom, who\xe2\x80\x99s a breast cancer survivor, has felt every day that she\xe2\x80\x99s lacked insurance because she can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, she\xe2\x80\x99s been priced out of it, or insurers simply won\xe2\x80\x99t give it to her because she has a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have to keep focused on the end goal here, which is making this insurance available to millions of Americans who need it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These struggles, as you say, Jay, are also, however, having a political impact.\xc2\xa0 And today the administration briefed a bunch of Democrats in the House, and as they came out you could clearly sense the frustration that they were having:\xc2\xa0 They were calling for accountability, they were demanding action, they were demanding more answers.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- these are your allies, these are people who you are asking to be out there supporting the health care plan -- what is the price that they might have to be pay?\xc2\xa0 And what is it that you can do to satisfy their demands for accountability, for answers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re working every day around the clock -- the team, specifically the tech teams -- on the website problems, to ensure that the experience is better so that those questions are answered and that the constituents of those lawmakers are given the services that they deserve and that they have earned through the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the frustration that lawmakers who supported the Affordable Care Act feel over the fact that a portion of it is not functioning at the level we want it to function is frustration shared, first and foremost, by the President and by all of us.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re crashing on these problems and applying a high level of expertise and experience to fixing them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The politics of this, I promise you, are not the focus of the White House or the administration, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re the focus of those on Capitol Hill who have long supported providing access to affordable health insurance to millions of Americans who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it in the past.\xc2\xa0 Their focus is on making that goal come true.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to brief them, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep everybody updated.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide as much information as we can on the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that beginning tomorrow, at the direction of Secretary Sebelius, there will be daily briefings at CMS to update individuals, reporters who are interested in the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made and the efforts that are being undertaken both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better, and that includes making Americans aware of the fact that there are four ways to enroll in the exchanges, and that includes not just online but by phone or at in-person centers in hospital or local health centers, or by mail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\'re going to work every day to make this experience better, to make sure that it\'s providing the benefits that the Affordable Care Act promises and will deliver, and to make sure that we can inform you as best as we can about the process that we\'re undertaking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question I wanted to ask about a personnel matter involving the NSC today.\xc2\xa0 I wondered, does the White House investigate all anonymous Twitter accounts that are critical of the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not have any information on personnel matters.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the individual does not work here anymore.\xc2\xa0 He was an employee of the State Department on temporary duty here [detailed to the National Security Staff for two years, after which time he was briefly put on the National Security Staff payroll].\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to him.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on it for you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are obviously codes of conduct in general, but this -- on specific instances or even a broad question like that, I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the Affordable Care Act rollout, Senator Shaheen, a Democrat, has said that many of her constituents are frustrated in enrolling, and has asked the President to consider a delay in the sign-up period.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President would consider or is considering?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, what I can tell you is that today Americans have access to affordable coverage -- today.\xc2\xa0 And that was true on October 1st.\xc2\xa0 They can enroll in four ways, as I just mentioned to Jim.\xc2\xa0 And we are working on the problems that are real and significant and unacceptable that exist in one of those avenues to enrolling on the website.</p>\n<p>We are still in the early stages of the open enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 We are in -- we are at, what, three weeks and two days into this process.\xc2\xa0 So we remain focused on making improvements to one of the avenues through which you can enroll, individuals can enroll, and in making Americans aware of the other access points available to them, and making those more effective by increasing staff at the call centers, for example, in peak times, or making the changes to the homepage of the healthcare.gov site clearer so that those who visit it know that those other avenues are available to them; that they can compare plans and get some estimates about what insurance might be available to them at what rough cost, but then, if they want to get more information and specifically to enroll they can -- and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it through the website or are having trouble through the website, they have these other avenues available to them.</p>\n<p>And we\'re going to tackle this problem every day.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to run this play, and we\'re going to get three yards, and we\'re going to keep running it and we\'re going to keep making progress.\xc2\xa0 And the important thing is that the insurance that is the core of this program is made available at affordable prices to millions of Americans who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- we\'re not making excuses for the serious problems that consumers have encountered on the website, but an element of this is the enormous demand that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we had high expectations for interest levels, but we did not expect what we saw and what we have seen.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge to us, to make this law work for those people who want it to work for them.\xc2\xa0 And that has nothing to do with politics, that has to do with the security of families across the country.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of stories -- and I think you\'ve seen them in the press -- of people who have gotten through, have enrolled, or have shopped and simply made themselves aware of the fact that their lives are going to change fundamentally for the better on January 1st, because they\'re going to have affordable health insurance that they did not have before, or because they had a preexisting condition that priced them out of the insurance market entirely.</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to measure the importance of that in the lives of individuals across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can jump to an international question?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You addressed yesterday questions about a possible rift with Saudi Arabia over that country\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about U.S. policies towards Iran and Syria.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering whether you have learned about those concerns through anything other than press reports, whether the government there has expressed those to you directly, and if so, what they said.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said yesterday that Secretary Kerry had been meeting with, in Paris, his Saudi counterpart.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously have a very close working relationship with Saudi Arabia, have had for a long time.\xc2\xa0 We have an enormous amount of important business that we do on a bilateral basis with Saudi Arabia, and that is a relationship of both friendship and respect.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we have disagreements on some issues, and we work those out in a candid and forthright way as we maintain the basic foundation of a very important relationship.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry addressed this I think at length when he took some questions in the aftermath of those meetings, and so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep working with our Saudi partners because that relationship is very important economically and in national security ways.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, lastly, on the Twitter issue, without asking you to address any specific personnel matters, does the White House as a result of this take any additional procedures to ensure the security or the integrity of tweets put out by employees of the executive branch?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on that point I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know that unless you have an authorized official Twitter account or social media account, as some of us do, White House employees are not able to access social media sites like that at all -- obviously for personal use.</p>\n<p>So I have @PressSec.\xc2\xa0 Josh and others, Jamie have official Twitter accounts.\xc2\xa0 But you can\'t go on Twitter and sign up for an account unless it\xe2\x80\x99s authorized.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Through White House equipment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We talked to some computer experts, because you suggested that we should.\xc2\xa0 One, Dave Kennedy, who is the CEO of a leading information security company, estimates that about 20 percent of healthcare.gov needs to be rewritten, estimating that to be about 100 million lines of code, and suggesting that fixing the site could take six months to a year.\xc2\xa0 Does that sort of -- is that what you are hearing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for question.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the way we\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0 Is that wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would refrain from doing is making estimates based on what you\'re reading in the press, and focus instead, as our tech experts are, on these specific identified problems that they\'ve found and the fixes that they\'re working on applying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our approach is to look head on at the problems and try to fix them every day, knowing that this is going to be a constant effort and that each day we\'re going to make some progress and each day they\'ll be an improvement to the user experience on healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 And each day we will work through a variety of means to provide information to Americans about the other avenues they can use to get information and enroll in an insurance plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not getting specific information from your techs about what the problems are.\xc2\xa0 You told us to talk to computer experts, so that\'s what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think that\'s a smart thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that unrealistic?\xc2\xa0 Because if you\'re talking six months to a year, obviously that\'s going to affect the mandate, I would imagine.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, from day one, people have been able to enroll -- from day one -- and that includes on healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 As we surged resources and brainpower towards fixing the problems that -- can I just finish -- that arose, the experience on healthcare.gov has incrementally improved.\xc2\xa0 And I think that has been acknowledged.\xc2\xa0 So from day one, people have been able to use the site.\xc2\xa0 The experience has been unacceptably problematic.\xc2\xa0 We are making changes every day and improvements every day to improve that experience so that more and more people can use it effectively.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re also making it clear that there are other ways to enroll, because the Affordable Care Act is not a website.\xc2\xa0 It is not like -- creating perfection on a website would not deliver what the Affordable Care Act promises.\xc2\xa0 What the Affordable Care Act promises is a marketplace for insurance products that provide that insurance affordably to millions of Americans across the country who cannot get it otherwise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s obviously an issue, as you\'ve acknowledged, that the website isn\'t up.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, because I look at this, six months to a year, that\'s a really long time.\xc2\xa0 Is that out of the realm of possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, what an outside computer expert might guestimate about what the end of a process would look like is obviously based on a lot of assumptions.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not judging it beyond saying that what we\'re doing is focusing on specific problems, isolating problems, for example, with signing up -- isolating problems that have been identified with the transmission of information from the website to individual insurers that has to do with getting the accurate information to those insurers so that they can provide the coverage that individuals have signed up for.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s -- these specific, identifiable problems are the things that the tech teams are working on and fixing through writing code, adding capacity<br/>\n\tthrough additional servers, and through a variety of other means.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The work of constantly improving a website will continue I think day by day.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- what I can tell you is that a week from now, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be better than it is today.\xc2\xa0 And a week after that, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be much better than it is today, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue and continue.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what endpoint an outside computer expert might be imagining.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that today and every day individuals are able to get important information from the website, they\xe2\x80\x99re able to enroll.\xc2\xa0 Often individuals experience frustration and delays and that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable, we\xe2\x80\x99re working to fix that, but others are succeeding and enrolling through the website.\xc2\xa0 Others are going through the different avenues that are available to them, and we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to keep breaking rocks on this until we are satisfied that Americans are able to use that website at a level of functionality that meets our expectations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I lastly ask about -- so a lot of computer experts told us that just because of how much code they estimate that to be -- and again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to go on because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics -- they actually say it would be easier to start from scratch, to scrap the whole thing and start over.\xc2\xa0 Is that under consideration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that -- two things.\xc2\xa0 One, we have tech teams working on specific fixes to the existing system, so our belief is that we are making fixes to the existing system.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the volume on the web track by -- on the website, rather, the traffic, by increasing our bandwidth and improving site architecture.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re substituting in hardware to make changes that make it more optimized, and we\xe2\x80\x99re improving database queries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There were tests done; there are going to be more tests done now that we know what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with in terms of volume.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re listening to consumer feedback and making changes that respond to what the consumers are saying they want so that existing features, for example, like the tax calculator or the ability to just search for general information about available plans is more prominently featured so that the consumer experience is improved.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to tackle this day by day.</p>\n<p>And we have some extremely talented people working on this and working with the existing team.\xc2\xa0 And at the direction of Secretary Sebelius and the President of the United States, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to work tirelessly until the consumer experience on the website matches the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As tempting as it is to ask you another question about health care, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to change the subject for a moment.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay, I was going to say you can keep at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, what has the President done specifically or the administration done specifically to restart after the shutdown and now after this Obamacare issue -- restart in the House an immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, noting, of course, that the shutdown ended about five minutes ago, in Washington -- in the way it feels, really -- but only a few days ago, and that we averted economic shutdown globally only a few days ago, the fact of the matter is, is that the minute that totally manufactured crisis was resolved, the President made clear in the remarks that he delivered that he firmly believes we can get comprehensive immigration reform through Congress and on his desk by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>So the answer to your question is we\xe2\x80\x99re talking with members and staff members in Congress about how to move forward.\xc2\xa0 I note that the Speaker of the House today said that he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue that can be and should be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways to do this.</p>\n<p>And obviously the leaders of the House have to decide how they want to proceed.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has passed a comprehensive bipartisan bill, a very significant achievement.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\'t match word-for-word what the President necessarily would have written, but it meets the criteria that he set, and he would sign it if the House were to pass essentially the identical version.\xc2\xa0 The way that it, as I understand it, needs to work is the House still has to produce its own bill or bills, and that that would have to be conferenced.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with the House.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll work with every interested party of both parties, or no party, to try to move this forward.\xc2\xa0 Because the point the President was making when he identified immigration reform and a budget deal and the farm bill as things that could get done at the end of the year, he was isolating them because bipartisan work has been done already on those areas.\xc2\xa0 And of course, when it comes to the budget, there is a conference coming together, which is something that we had hoped and called for all year.</p>\n<p>He did not, although it was suggested in some places -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at you, Peter -- somehow lower his ambitions.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if anybody had said at the beginning of the year that if we had identified completion of comprehensive immigration reform as a goal to achieve at the end of the year, that that was somehow small potatoes, you would have been laughed at.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big deal, and we think we can get it done.</p>\n<p>So obviously, it depends on the House acting.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that part, there have been in the last couple of days proposals made from the Republican side which seem to include even a pathway to citizenship -- perhaps a more difficult pathway.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House reached out to those people across the aisle and begun to talk to them about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about specific conversations related to specific proposals.\xc2\xa0 The President is interested in constructive proposals that would move us forward and lead us to achieve a comprehensive solution that meet his criteria, and a pathway to citizenship is one of them.\xc2\xa0 The one that he envisioned and the one that the Senate passed is a serious piece of business.\xc2\xa0 It requires getting in the back of the line, paying fines and past taxes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very responsible approach to meeting that challenge, and it increases significantly resources for border security.</p>\n<p>It addresses the issue -- the profound issue that especially technology companies, but other companies have identified, American companies, and that is the need to retain highly capable talent here in the United States, immigrant talent -- people who come here to study at the best universities in the world and haven\xe2\x80\x99t always been able to stay to start businesses or to go work with American businesses because of our immigration laws.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is a lot of important work that was achieved in that comprehensive bill that passed the Senate that meets the President\xe2\x80\x99s criteria, and he believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan majority in the House, and probably a significant one, that would support that similar comprehensive approach.</p>\n<p>So we\'re going to work in every way we can to get that done.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\'s in the interest of the country, it\'s in the interest of the economy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when we talk about ways that we can grow the economy and add jobs, it\'s pass comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- I\'m trying to get a little more pointed on this, is that there -- because of what happened with the shutdown and the fact that nobody trusts anybody anymore across the aisle, is the President going to do anything to try to bridge that trust again by talking to those on the Republican side?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s where I think it\'s important to remember:\xc2\xa0 The experience we all enjoyed -- and I use that sarcastically -- in the shutdown wasn\'t brought about by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 In other words, it wasn\'t brought about by all Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t supported by all Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It was caused by a faction of the Republican Party in one house, with some prominent help by supporters in the other house.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of Republican lawmakers who want to make progress on comprehensive immigration reform, and we\'ve had a lot of conversations and consultations with them at the presidential level.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Senators McCain and Graham have played enormously constructive roles in this process and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And there are members of the House Republican conference who support that kind of bipartisan comprehensive approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is not about mistrust between Democrats on the one side and Republicans on the other.\xc2\xa0 I mean, a lot of these challenges have to do with allowing the natural bipartisan coalitions that can be formed to form, and for those bipartisan coalitions to vote on bipartisan solutions.\xc2\xa0 If that happens, we can get comprehensive immigration reform, we can get a farm bill, we can get even a budget deal.\xc2\xa0 So those are lofty goals, but they\'re achievable.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One bit of housekeeping -- there are several health care CEOs here today to meet with White House officials.\xc2\xa0 Will the President also meet with them?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us who they\'re meeting with, and will you provide a list of all of those who are attending?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me do that right now -- I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, senior administration officials are in fact meeting today with health insurance industry CEOs at 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 -- 15 minutes or so -- at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The officials include Denis McDonough, Valerie Jarrett, Secretary Sebelius, and Chris Jennings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The purpose of the meeting is to continue to discuss open enrollment and ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The CEOs bring an important on-the-ground perspective as we work to implement the law.\xc2\xa0 And the group is expected to also discuss the ongoing efforts to fix the technical issues with healthcare.gov, and continue to improve the consumer experience.</p>\n<p>I have a list of attendees -- we can provide it to you -- but they include the CEOs of Aetna, Humana, CareFirst, BlueCross BlueShield of Florida, Health Net, Inc., Tufts Health Plan, BlueCross BlueShield --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Slow --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, no, no -- you want me to read them all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna.\xc2\xa0 Bruce Broussard, the CEO of Humana.\xc2\xa0 Chet Burrell, CEO of CareFirst.\xc2\xa0 Patrick Geraghty, CEO of BlueCross BlueShield of Florida.\xc2\xa0 Jay Gellert, president and CEO of Health Net, Inc.\xc2\xa0 Patricia Hemingway Hall, president and CEO of Health Care Services Corporation.\xc2\xa0 Daniel J. Hilferty, president and CEO, Independence BlueCross.\xc2\xa0 Karen Ignagni -- I hope I pronounced that right, probably not -- president and CEO, America\'s Health Insurance Plans.\xc2\xa0 Michael Neidorff, chairman and CEO of Centene Corp.\xc2\xa0 James Roosevelt, president and CEO, Tufts Health Plan.\xc2\xa0 Scott Serota, president and CEO, BlueCross BlueShield Association.\xc2\xa0 Joseph Swedish, CEO, Wellpoint.\xc2\xa0 And Bernard Tyson, CEO, Kaiser Permanente.</p>\n<p>And as I said at the top, the discussion will focus on implementation and enrollment.\xc2\xa0 It will focus on the efforts to fix the technical issues that have been identified with healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 And one of those issues has to do with making sure that insurers are getting accurate information from the virtual marketplace, from individuals, so that they can then provide them with the coverage that individuals are signing up to get.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So obviously, these are very important players in this process.\xc2\xa0 And Denis and others look forward to the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate the President in this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have him as a participant in this, so I don\'t anticipate that.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s a small building.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to pick up on something that was discussed here yesterday and maybe get a little more specific.\xc2\xa0 On the new feature that has been added to the website where if you put in your ZIP code, you get an estimate of your costs -- as we understand it, if you are 50 and older, you get an estimate for someone who is 50 years old, and if you\'re 49 and younger -- those are the two categories broadly on the federal website -- you get an estimate for someone who is 27 years old.\xc2\xa0 If you go deeper in the process, you can often find from that estimate a much larger actual premium cost, because you could be older and older people require higher premiums.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you\'re going to keep?\xc2\xa0 Do you find that there\'s anything that\'s deceptive or less than clear or candid in that consumer experience that you\'re trying to provide?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A great question.\xc2\xa0 And let me make clear two things.\xc2\xa0 One, these are estimates and we\'re just trying to provide basic information in an easily acceptable way.\xc2\xa0 The idea that we\'re trying to mislead people about costs is belied entirely by the irrefutable fact that premiums were published and provided to the public prior to October 1st.\xc2\xa0 And those premiums for these plans were published without subsidies attached to them.\xc2\xa0 So in other words, they seemed much more expensive for most individuals than the cost would actually be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in terms of making improvements to the website, moving this feature into a place so that it was more accessible for average users so they could window shop was a change they\'d make.\xc2\xa0 And, specifically, I don\'t know what all the changes they may make, but I\'m sure they\'re going to continue to try to make the user experience better.</p>\n<p>One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important to note is that in terms of the volume we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, the volume -- because there have been some assertions that making this feature available has affected or had something to do with the technological problems that have existed -- the volume we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that began on October 1st was roughly 30 percent browsers and 70 percent potential enrollees or applicants.\xc2\xa0 Since this feature was added, that percentage breakdown has not changed -- has not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask you is some of the statewide exchanges don\xe2\x80\x99t have a ZIP code at the front end, they have an age at the front end, so you get a much more direct and more rapid explanation on their websites of the premiums that you\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to pay as opposed to an estimate.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a practical comparison application that you could on the federal website look at and incorporate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s important and that\xe2\x80\x99s about consumer feedback and what\xe2\x80\x99s useful.\xc2\xa0 But the underlying assumption here is that we\xe2\x80\x99d be hiding the ball when, in fact, the premiums were published and have been public and they have been available information forever, A.\xc2\xa0 And, B, if you want specific --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have acknowledged that the average consumer is not necessarily going to be familiar with that database or access it and that this is one of their first experiences with trying to figure out the cost.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s been true from day one is that you could go on the site, enter in specific information about your age, where you live, and that sort of stuff, and get much more specific estimates about what your premiums would be.\xc2\xa0 So that has always been available.\xc2\xa0 Our interest is in providing as much information as possible to consumers about their choices.</p>\n<p>And the bottom line, as was evident prior to October 1st and is true today, and will be true throughout the enrollment period, is that -- what is it -- six out of ten individuals who purchase insurance through the marketplaces are going to pay on average under $100 a month in premiums.\xc2\xa0 So our interest is in making people aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s available to them and giving them as much information about the options available to them as possible.\xc2\xa0 And as we find ways to improve the consumer experience, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make those improvements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is related to what Brianna asked about, and with your indulgence let me just read something that was in the New Yorker yesterday, because it quotes a guy named Fred Brooks, who has written a very well-received book about software project management, and he has something that\xe2\x80\x99s called the Brooks law, which goes as follows:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9dAdding manpower to a software project late makes it late.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he goes on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is taken as gospel by programmers because it\xe2\x80\x99s usually true.\xc2\xa0 It takes so much time for new coders to comprehend the system that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be fixing that typically it would have been faster not to include them at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIn this case, though,\xe2\x80\x9d the writer says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be some chance that a tech surge will work.\xc2\xa0 The project is already made of discrete parts that could be improved by many teams working in parallel.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if, based on what you know and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed on internally, do you think this latter scenario is possible?\xc2\xa0 And if so, if you could explain why it\xe2\x80\x99s possible --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually an excellent shorthand description of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, which is that there are many areas of the website that can be addressed in a focused way by teams that look at the problems that have arisen and been exposed by the launch and the volume that occurred after the launch.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve isolated those problems and they\xe2\x80\x99re isolating those problems, and they address them when it has to do with capacity by adding capacity, when it has to do with code by writing new code; optimizing the interface for users where that helps; and consulting technology specialists operating state-based exchanges, which as many of you have noted, have been working, at least in many cases, effectively, obviously on a smaller scale, but to share best practices and incorporate them.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done here is bring in some fresh eyes and brains and had them -- attach them to existing teams.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not starting fresh and asking people to suddenly learn the system, having lost the expertise that existed as the system was built.\xc2\xa0 These are new eyes and tech experts who are being brought in to add capacity, bring capacity and a fresh look as we address these problems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the specifics you mentioned there, will they be a part of the briefings that will commence tomorrow at CMS?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously you know all of us here are very hungry for assessments, specific interventions you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, things you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, how you\xe2\x80\x99re rewriting the code or how you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with capacity.\xc2\xa0 Will we finally get to the point tomorrow at these briefings where we can actually hear and see and tangibly report on these developments?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re setting up a process where there will be regular briefings, at Secretary Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s instigation, that would try to answer your questions and provide as much information as possible about this ongoing work.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very technical.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very process-oriented.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that it\xe2\x80\x99s housed over there because that\xe2\x80\x99s closer to the ground.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where this is happening.\xc2\xa0 CMS obviously oversees this process and the affordable -- and the Department of Health and Human Services oversees CMS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try to provide as much information as we can.\xc2\xa0 I can promise you that every question that you have won\xe2\x80\x99t be -- we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to answer, or they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to answer right away, they may have to go back and get more information.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an effort here to give you a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and how we\xe2\x80\x99re addressing these challenges.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to talk health care, but a couple of foreign policy issues first.\xc2\xa0 There were reports out of Germany this morning that the German government believes that as part of the NSA surveillance, the U.S. government was monitoring Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm or deny that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that today, President Obama and Chancellor Merkel spoke by telephone regarding the allegations that you mention, that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted the communications of the German Chancellor.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that the President assured the Chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the Chancellor.</p>\n<p>The United States greatly values our close cooperation with Germany on a broad range of shared security challenges.\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, the U.S. is reviewing the way that we gather intelligence to ensure that we properly balance the security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.\xc2\xa0 Both leaders agreed to intensify further the cooperation between our intelligence services, with the goal of protecting the security of both countries and of our partners, as well as protecting the privacy of our citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And when you say -- pardon me -- \xe2\x80\x9cnot monitoring,\xe2\x80\x9d does that leave the door open to the possibility the NSA, as part of a broader sweep, picked up some of her communications but was not \xe2\x80\x9cmonitoring\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is what the President told the chancellor.\xc2\xa0 The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, we gather foreign intelligence just like agencies\xc2\xa0 -- similar agencies of other countries.\xc2\xa0 But we are working to, as the President has said, to review the way that we gather intelligence to ensure that we properly balance both the security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that everyone shares.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President this afternoon meeting with the Pakistani Prime Minister -- obviously, a lot on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 One issue, though, that has come up in the last couple of years is this Pakistani doctor who was put in prison because he helped the U.S. government find bin Laden, which obviously the U.S. government felt was very valuable.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President is still pushing on?\xc2\xa0 Is that something he would raise?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that our position on Dr. Afridi has long been clear, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will again make it clear during this visit.\xc2\xa0 We believe his treatment is both unjust and unwarranted.\xc2\xa0 He should be released.\xc2\xa0 Bringing Osama bin Laden to justice was clearly in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s interests, and the prosecution and conviction of Dr. Afridi sends exactly the wrong message about the importance of this shared interest.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that we have in a sustained way made clear to Pakistan, and will continue to include during this visit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple quick ones on health care.\xc2\xa0 When Jim asked you at the beginning about what Secretary Sebelius told CNN about the President not being told before October 1st, you seemed to confirm that timeline.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President told, though?\xc2\xa0 This is his signature achievement.\xc2\xa0 Was he being insulated from the potential damage?\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he told?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 What the President made clear, and he\xe2\x80\x99s on the record saying this I think well ahead of the launch, is that we expected hiccups and glitches, as you would expect from the launch of any major complex website.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we expected.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I think the teams expected.\xc2\xa0 And we did not expect or anticipate the scale of the problems that has occurred.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s on us.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that testing was done and testing should have been more thorough, and therefore we would have been more prepared for this kind of challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stress test that The Washington Post reported on yesterday, where hundreds were simultaneously getting on the site and that it crashed, was that not passed on to the President?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that there were tests done, and that while there was an expectation that there would be problems and glitches, that they would not be of the significance and scale that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and that they would be ones that could be dealt with; and while the site was operating and operating relatively smoothly, again, with the understanding that the launch of any website of this complexity would have some initial problems.</p>\n<p>So the answer is -- I think the fundamental answer to these questions is, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely correct that the website from October 1st has not and did not operate as smoothly or even close to as smoothly as we anticipated, based on the information that we had, and that includes the people working on the site itself.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for that, and that\'s why the President and the Secretary have directed this significant around-the-clock effort to systematically make changes and adjustments and fixes to the website to improve the user experience.</p>\n<p>What is true is that every day, including the first day, Americans from across the country in the states that utilize the federal exchanges have been getting information they need, signing up, and enrolling.\xc2\xa0 And our goal is to just make that process easier every day, and to make it easier on the website and to make it easier by making sure that Americans know that there are three other avenues through which they can achieve the same goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very last one.\xc2\xa0 The President has said in many public forums that he would be willing to make reasonable changes to his health care law if Republicans present them.\xc2\xa0 Republican Marco Rubio has presented a bill that would basically say delay any IRS penalties until people can fully enroll, until we know the website is fully operational.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, a Democrat, Jean Shaheen, wrote a letter, as I understand it, to the President yesterday saying she\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the enrollment deadline in March extended further so that people have more time.\xc2\xa0 Are these reasonable approaches that the President is going to look at and might even support?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They address slightly different issues.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we\xe2\x80\x99re on the third week and second day of a six-month process.\xc2\xa0 And from day one, people have been able to get information and enroll.\xc2\xa0 The process through the website has been unacceptably complicated and difficult, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to fix that every day.\xc2\xa0 But meanwhile, people are getting the information they need, and they are shopping, and they are signing up, and they are enrolling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Two, when it comes to the individual mandate, I think -- I\'ll say two things about proposals from Republicans who have said it is their mission to eliminate, decimate, sabotage Obamacare from the beginning, who were willing with great glee to shut the government down because of their opposition to Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 We have to take their proposals with a grain of salt.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\'re filled with sincerity about -- a sincere desire to improve the system.\xc2\xa0 They have made clear that their goal is eliminate the system, and thereby eliminate the possibility for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions or millions of American who don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance, the possibility of getting it.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one.</p>\n<p>Two, when it comes to -- and we talked about this when they were shutting down the government over the President\'s refusal to pay a ransom -- an Obamacare ransom in exchange for keeping the government open or in exchange for raising the debt ceiling -- we talked about delaying the so-called individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 Well, what does that mean concretely?\xc2\xa0 That means that if you\'re that single mom who\'s a breast cancer survivor who has been anticipating the day that she would be able to get affordable health insurance which would give her the security of knowing that she would have the care she needed to stay alive for her family, you\'re telling them, wait another year -- and wait another year because the people behind the proposal actually want to make you wait forever.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to happen.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very simply, can you tell us how many people have enrolled for private insurance through the health care law?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said, Peter, I think on numerous occasions, we will be providing that information monthly, as is the case with similar systems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how many people have enrolled?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would tell you that we will provide that information monthly.\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about -- again, when it\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important because Kathleen Sebelius yesterday said that the number is in the thousands.\xc2\xa0 The President said the number is in the thousands.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\'m trying to confirm that you guys actually know what the number is and have just actively chosen not to communicate it to the American public.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The number is in the thousands.\xc2\xa0 I think the point is, and I think that the Secretary said this, is that we\'re gathering -- we want to make sure the information is correct, we want to do it on a regularized basis.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about people who are signing up through state exchanges, who are signing up in person, who are signing up by mail, who are signing up over the phone and signing up on healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>So it makes all the sense in the world to regularize the release of that information in the way that has been done with previous similar programs.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\'re going to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about this tech surge.\xc2\xa0 How much --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say that, on that point, we have made clear from the beginning, including before we encountered the problems that we\'ve seen on the website, that it has been our expectation, because this has been the case in Massachusetts and it\'s been the case with other programs, that when there is an open enrollment period, people tend to -- the disproportionate number of people who demonstrate an interest in the product shop and don\'t buy en masse until the end.\xc2\xa0 That was the case in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 That was the case with a variety of other programs, including federal programs.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s always been our expectation that the majority of people would be enrolling closer to the deadline.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why we had this six-month period is to provide a lot of time for people to shop and look at their options because this is a new -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a new deal for people, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a special and important deal for people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions quickly, if I can.\xc2\xa0 First of all, how much money is this tech surge costing us, or should we anticipate the tech surge will cost us?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that some members of the so-called tech surge are presidential innovation fellows that are paid already, and they\'re simply -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve been assigned specifically to this task.\xc2\xa0 There are others who are already government employees who are being assigned to the task.\xc2\xa0 And then there are those who are coming from the private sector, and they\'re being hired by contractors under existing contracts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then I want to finally, if I can quickly -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to a number of health care providers; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s like the visitors that are going to be here at the White House today.\xc2\xa0 They\'re reporting a number like 10 to 20 insurance enrollments a day.\xc2\xa0 One of them told us that there was a 50 percent error rate, which means the data they\'re receiving -- not the registration process -- the data they\'re receiving is wrong half the time, and that that information doesn\'t just come through the website, it comes through the computer system in general.\xc2\xa0 So when you call in, or you do it in person, that same transmission system provides the language, refers to what\xe2\x80\x99s called an 834, but a data transmission sheet with information that is wrong.</p>\n<p>So given that, is it unfair to tell Americans right now to keep trying if so much of the information that\'s being provided to the insurance companies is presently wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the percentage error rate is -- I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you, and I mentioned this at the top, that one of the problems that has been identified and that is being worked on is that stage towards the end when information is provided to insurers, an 834 I believe is what -- how it\xe2\x80\x99s identified.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that I expect will be discussed with the CEOs of insurers today.\xc2\xa0 And we are -- the tech team is working specifically on this challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 Should Americans who know that there are errors in the transmission of this information be frustrated?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Should they therefore decide not to buy insurance?\xc2\xa0 I think the answer is no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because the people who -- remember 80 to 85 percent of us already have insurance through our employer or through Medicare or Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s those other millions of Americans for whom these marketplaces have been built and for whom the security of having affordable health insurance is something extremely valuable.\xc2\xa0 And our goal is to make purchasing that insurance as easy as possible.\xc2\xa0 And we are enormously frustrated that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t succeeded thus far in making it as easy as possible through the website.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work every day to make it as easy as possible.\xc2\xa0 But the point is to provide the insurance that the Americans who have shown interest in it want so desperately, and that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on.</p>\n<p>So the answer is, yes, for those people who are frustrated, to tell them we\xe2\x80\x99re working on the challenges here with the website, but what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is not just fixing a website.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re making sure that they have insurance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just want to say, guys, for everybody in the back, I think we did about 45 minutes on the front row, which is why I mix it up sometimes.\xc2\xa0 But I just want to get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, but you need to come back here, too.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it, April.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following up on what you said earlier about a code of conduct for people with White House approved --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just mean generally.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about this specific case.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I have no details about it.\xc2\xa0 The individual doesn\'t work here, and I would refer you to him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we assume that tweets by people with approved accounts amount to statements on behalf of the White House and the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s language attached to those accounts that says whatever it says in legalese, and I think those are archived just like every email that\'s sent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For example, would it be proper for someone with an approved White House account to re-tweet an item from a satirical publication that makes fun of the President\xe2\x80\x99s opponents?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s like speaking on behalf of the President.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it depends on the context.\xc2\xa0 I can -- if you want to show me an example of it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that as a spokesman, as somebody who is out on the record every day, there are things that I say I wish I could have back.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s true when I speak officially of almost everybody -- there are things I say, speaking officially, that sometimes I wish I could have them back.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not said eloquently or grammatically or maybe the tone isn\xe2\x80\x99t right, and I think every spokesperson around the administration and on Capitol Hill would probably agree with me on that.</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s different.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking as an official, obviously you have responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, your counterpart at the State Department said it is not correct that this person worked for the State Department.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question then.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She says at one point he had been a State Department employee detailed at the White House but at some point this summer he was made a National Security Staff employee and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re handling the questions about the personnel matter there.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, Peter, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a lot about this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get what information we can provide.\xc2\xa0 In general, we don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss personnel matters</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you post a clarification if --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will find out what information I can.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad this is of such intense interest.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have a health care coverage, but if there\xe2\x80\x99s time maybe you could come back to me or I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow-up by email, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to yield my question to one of the visiting Pakistani journalists.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Please go ahead, sir, and identify yourself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My name is Naveed Hussain -- Daily Business Recorder in Islamabad.\xc2\xa0 My first question is, the peace accords in Afghanistan and Pakistan depend on opening talks with the Taliban of both countries, facilitated by the United States, yet no such talks have begun and there is no sign that they will be.\xc2\xa0 What happens after 2014 if no such talks have succeeded?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about reconciliation talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we absolutely believe that ultimate peace and security in Afghanistan depends on reconciliation, and we have played a roll in trying to facilitate that process.\xc2\xa0 But it is a process that involves the two parties directly, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work on that with our partners in Kabul.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important challenge because ultimately this needs to be resolved in that way.</p>\n<p>So I think the separate issue when you talk about 2014 has to do with our ongoing consultations with the Afghan government about the bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 There was significant progress made recently in those talks when Secretary Kerry was there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information for you on that as well as our decisions about continued support for Afghanistan in the aftermath of 2014.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the United States prepared to provide civil nuclear technology to help Pakistan overcome its energy crisis along the same lines as the U.S. in civil nuclear --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that.</p>\n<p>Yes, Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clarify -- with the CEOs, is what the President is trying to do thro\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ugh Denis and Valerie, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pop in himself, to assure them that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to fall apart and that the financing of the expansion will make sense?\xc2\xa0 Or is he soliciting help from them in trying to figure out how to improve the website?\xc2\xa0 Basically -- I know they\'re going to talk about the problems and try to move forward, but, kind of, how?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the focus?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the technological work --the technical work is being done by the teams who are working on the website.\xc2\xa0 I think the insurance companies themselves -- and I would obviously point you to what they\'ve said and what their positions are -- have a great interest in the Affordable Care Act working effectively and by working effectively, therefore increasing the number of insured Americans in the private insurance market.</p>\n<p>So it\'s obviously an issue of great interest to them, and one that we have consulted with them regularly on since the Affordable Care Act was being drafted.\xc2\xa0 So this is a part of that process.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, this is -- I identified the senior officials who are in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 The President is not scheduled to attend, but certainly the Chief of Staff, the Secretary is, and it\'s something we view as an important part of this process.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Question on immigration, just to follow up on Jim\'s question.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Senators McCain and Graham, but since the action on immigration -- or the inaction -- is in the House, does he have plans or has he talked to House Republicans about this, or is this the kind of issue that his direct involvement at this point would be counterproductive?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that last question is always an interesting one and probably best addressed to Republicans who sometimes feel that anything associated with him is not something they could support, but it gets at a bigger problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Having said that, the wisdom and the benefits of comprehensive immigration reform we believe supersede these kinds of partisan differences.\xc2\xa0 Even in crass political terms, I think it\'s fair to say that it is in the interest of the Republican Party to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 They said so themselves.\xc2\xa0 Key members of the party, key leaders and spokesmen, the Speaker of the House today said it\'s an important issue and we should address it.\xc2\xa0 I think Chairman Ryan has said that and others in the House.\xc2\xa0 But their politics is something, obviously, they have to take care of and make judgments about themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we know is that there is just an overwhelming abundance of information that argues in favor of passing comprehensive immigration reform -- in other words, that if you were a Republican who wanted to argue why you\'re going to vote yes for something like this, there\'s just a lot there for you when it comes to economic growth and job creation; when it comes to fairness for middle-class Americans and accountability for all American business; when it comes to dramatically increased resources for border security, to build on the substantial improvements in border security that we\'ve already seen in the last five years.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that there are conservative reasons to do this and that there has been broad bipartisan support and will continue to be.\xc2\xa0 And we hope the House takes action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has the President talked to -- had private, direct talks with House Republicans or does he have plans to do so?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, I get that everything is always reduced to whether or not the President of the United States is on the phone with or speaking with the Speaker of the House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily the Speaker --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Or the chairman or whoever.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a narrow view about how this can come about.\xc2\xa0 The answer is he will, he has, and he is having conversations with Republicans about comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But if that\'s all it took, we would have gotten there already, because we\'ve had many conversations with supporters of it, many conversations with those who are on the fence about it.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, obviously, the House has to act and we hope they will.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, in terms of the President talking to Republicans and the efficacy of that, can you roll out what -- there was a -- the number-two Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, said on his Facebook page that someone in recent exchange with the President said he can\'t even stand -- this member of Congress said he can\'t even stand to look at the President.\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether that happened?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I looked into this and spoke with somebody who was in that meeting, and it did not happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anyone speak -- from the White House speak to Senator Durbin about it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that, again, from a participant in the meeting, that that didn\'t happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anything like it happen that would have led to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said you don\'t want to talk about personnel matters when it comes to @NatSecWonk and the firing.\xc2\xa0 But most of the tweets that have been reported are really not very substantive.\xc2\xa0 They\'re rather sophomoric and take shots at people on really personal levels about their appearance and such, a lot of that.\xc2\xa0 Are there emails that the White House saw that were substantive that divulged or gave out information?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a person who got fired, after all.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jackie, I understand.\xc2\xa0 I would address your questions to the individual.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\'t work here anymore, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information for you on that personnel matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t rule out whether there was anything of a certain national security secret --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have any information on that to provide.</p>\n<p>Carrie, and then April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the upcoming budget talks, is the White House still adhering to the principle that any -- just in terms of the sequester and any attempt to buy down the sequester over the next few years, that there are attempts to buy it down that equally divide it between cuts and revenue?\xc2\xa0 Is that a principle the White House is adhering to in those talks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our approach has always been that when it comes to a broader budget deal we need to apply balance; that reducing the deficit further, building on the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made that\'s allowed us to cut the deficit in half since the President took office requires a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there has always been for a number of years now talk of a grand bargain, of 10-year deals, smaller deals, and so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to negotiate from here speculatively about what a smaller deal would look like.\xc2\xa0 But balance is a fundamental principle that this President has not only espoused but put on paper in detailed proposals.</p>\n<p>So we believe it has long been in the interest of both parties to deal with the arbitrary cuts that the sequester represents.\xc2\xa0 It has done harm.\xc2\xa0 As Jason Furman mentioned yesterday, according to CBO, an average of 60,000 jobs that have not been created because of -- per month -- because of the sequester -- certainly something we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in addressing.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget eliminated the sequester and then reduced the deficit beyond what the sequester reduces it, so by addressing our budget challenges in a very focused way -- making an increase in investments in key areas while eliminating or reducing programs that aren\xe2\x80\x99t working affectively or don\xe2\x80\x99t work at all, and approaching the issue of deficit reduction in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a broad way of saying that\xe2\x80\x99s the principle and the approach that we take into it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the conference makes progress as they try to reconcile the Senate and House budgets, and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in, as the President made clear, a budget deal that moves this country forward, that helps it create jobs, helps it grow faster.\xc2\xa0 Those are the priorities we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 We have been focused on deficit reduction and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more to do, but we have to do it in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And revenues?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think when you talk about a broad deal, the nature of which that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate like hypothetical smaller deals.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that a broad larger budget agreement, the kind envisioned by the President in his budget, would have to be balanced.</p>\n<p>Yes, April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, three questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then the Voice of America, and then Tommy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, three questions, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Three questions.\xc2\xa0 Go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Peter\xe2\x80\x99s question, is there --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to fly out of here in a few minutes -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a parent-teacher conference.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Go.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- you get your questions, April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Anyway, moving on.\xc2\xa0 On the Affordable Care Act, on the tracking issue, is there an integrated approach at all on tracking with states and insurance companies right now to track how many people have enrolled at this point?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re gathering information.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to release specific information about enrollment figures on a monthly basis, beginning in November, and it will look back to October.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific information to provide to you about that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do this in the way that it has been traditionally done with similar programs.</p>\n<p>What I can tell you, as I mentioned to Peter, is that we have always, even predating the problems with the website, anticipated that, in keeping with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in other programs of similar nature, and even in keeping with open enrollment periods that you see in insurance plans that you guys probably sign up for every year, a lot of people do a lot of their enrolling at the very end while they shop earlier.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing we expect to see, but we will be providing information monthly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the secret Twitter handle scandal, has the White House in any way changed guidelines for staffers, for administration officials in how it relates with social media?\xc2\xa0 Because many people have their own social media on their own privately, and then they have the government one.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen anything new on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a revamping of gun control from the President any time soon, since the shutdown is over and things are coming back?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 Look, this is an issue that the President believes we can and should make progress on in a bipartisan way that achieves some comprehensive -- or not comprehensive -- some common-sense steps towards reducing gun violence that do not in any way infringe upon our Second Amendment rights, which the President supports.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s always looking at ways, either through Congress or through his executive authority, to chip away at this program.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce, but it certainly is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.</p>\n<p>April, was that your third?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tommy, and then VOA, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just have two.\xc2\xa0 My first question is, about a week and a half ago, there was a protest out in front of the White House here at which a confederate flag was flown.\xc2\xa0 And then in the last couple of days, Congressman Alan Grayson sent out a fundraiser where he -- there was a photo of a burning cross, and he compared the tea party with the Klan.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is aware of either of these incidents and if he had a reaction.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about them and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question:\xc2\xa0 This morning on CNN, Carol Costello said that during -- while she was reporting on the presidential race, her comment was, \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x99s people can be quite nasty.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t like you to say anything bad about their boss and they\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid to use whatever means they have at hand to stop you from doing that, including threatening your job.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 To your knowledge --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know -- who said that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol Costello from CNN.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone here threaten her job or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of or have ever heard of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to do this justice in a few minutes but, on Iran, there seems to be still a huge space between what the Secretary of State said today about an undeniably clear guarantee from Iran about peaceful purposes and what Netanyahu is saying about the need to remove centrifuges, to get rid of plutonium capability, and to remove what Israel calls -- he calls the military nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what the hopes are for bridging that kind of a difference between --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we work very closely with our Israeli counterparts in assessing the Iranian program and in judging where they are and what steps need to be made to assure the international community that they have given up their nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- two things are indisputable.\xc2\xa0 One is we are where we are, with the potential for progress in this area through diplomacy, because of the comprehensive set of sanctions that was engineered by the United States and our partners that has put enormous pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 What is also true is that we will not provide relief from sanctions until we see concrete, transparent steps by Iran towards reaching that point where they can verifiably demonstrate to the world that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is our -- it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated policy that we will not accept Iran with a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a position obviously we share with many countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR.
