PDT</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Welcome onboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 You all saw Secretary Locke is joining us today.\xc2\xa0 At his remarks at a small business in Seattle, the President will discuss the fact that the Senate is going to take on the small business bill when they come back into session and the importance of Republicans stopping their obstruction so that small business owners can get the assistance that they need as soon as humanly possible to create an environment where small businesses can be creating jobs and the economy can continue to grow.</p>\n<p>With that, I\'m happy to take any questions you might have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Bill, with all the campaigning the President is doing, how far is he willing to go in saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s confident the House and Senate will stay Democratic?\xc2\xa0 Is he willing to guarantee it?\xc2\xa0 How confident is he?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 How far is he willing to go?\xc2\xa0 Interestingly put.\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that this election is a choice between the policies that move our country forward or the policies that got us to the crisis that we\'re in right now.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s confident that given that choice in the voting booths in November that Democrats will be successful and he does think that we will hold on to both the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think -- so the White House\xe2\x80\x99s feeling is that things are trending well right now; with all of these campaign stops it\xe2\x80\x99s making a difference?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into the punditry of it, but the President thinks that this is fundamentally a choice and it\xe2\x80\x99s a choice where the Americans will choose to continue making progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President having fun on the campaign trail right now, considering every day the polls are beating him down, every day he\xe2\x80\x99s getting a lot of backseat-driving advice?\xc2\xa0 Is this fun for him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has gotten a lot of advice from all corners ever since he started out on the campaign trail February 10, 2007.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he appreciates the opportunity to go out there and make the case to the American people about what his policies have done to help make our economy stronger, what he\xe2\x80\x99s done to make our country safer, and the choice that people have in this election between continuing on our economic policies, like the small business bill that he\'ll be talking about today, that get more loans to small businesses; that cut -- that end capital gains for their investments.\xc2\xa0 So he does enjoy making that case to the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Enjoying the campaign trail this week?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He enjoys making the case.\xc2\xa0 He obviously would enjoy it more if he could spend more time with his family.\xc2\xa0 But I think that as one of the hats that he wears as the leader of the Democratic Party, as President of the United States, he does like going out and talking to the American people, hearing what\xe2\x80\x99s on their minds and explaining how he sees the choice in this election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s disagreeing with the President on the mosque issue?\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to him? Did Reid\xe2\x80\x99s people give you guys a heads-up about that?\xc2\xa0 What was his reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We did have a sense that that\'s what they were going to do.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at what the President said on Friday night, he respects the right of anybody -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- to disagree with his opinion on this. That\'s one of the other fundamental rights written into the DNA\xc2\xa0 of our Constitution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Senator Reid is a fiercely independent individual; it\xe2\x80\x99s one of his strengths as a leader of the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 So the President feels completely fine that he might disagree.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you view Senator Reid and the President disagree on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the statements are different.\xc2\xa0 What the President said was that he thinks that there\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamental right for individuals and groups to be treated equally.\xc2\xa0 But the President, like he said on Saturday, didn\xe2\x80\x99t comment specifically on whether or not he was pushing for the site to actually to be put in that spot.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s comment was he thinks that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is a different statement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a different statement -- do they agree?\xc2\xa0 Do they disagree?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll leave it to the smart guys like you, Chuck, to decide whether or not that means disagreement or different statement or what\xe2\x80\x99s up and what\xe2\x80\x99s down.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a different take on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- decide not to speak to the insurance commissioners today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Just postponed it for a month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\xc2\xa0 What --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Just postponed it for a month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I just think that the President thought it was important to talk about small businesses and the importance of getting moving on that right when the Senate gets back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on reports today that the President may announce loosening travel restrictions for groups to Cuba?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen those reports and I don\'t have anything new to announce.\xc2\xa0 But the President is going to continue to do things that are in the best interest of the United States and that help to create a more democratic environment and expand freedoms for the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some members of Congress are saying they did not get a heads-up about the mosque comments, even though the President spoke to Mayor Bloomberg.\xc2\xa0 Why not discuss this with the senators, or even Representative Gillibrand?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President spoke to Mayor Bloomberg -- I don\'t think that that\'s accurate -- about this beforehand.\xc2\xa0 We have very close relationships with our partners on Capitol Hill, and sometimes -- we talk to them every day at different levels of the West Wing, but we take each issue on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that the President viewed through a political lens.\xc2\xa0 This is something that he saw as his obligation to address.\xc2\xa0 So there you go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President briefed on the Iraq bombing this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, made aware.\xc2\xa0 And the President condemns those attacks.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously still people who want to derail the advances that the Iraqi people have made towards democracy, but they are firmly on track and we\'re confident that we\'re moving towards the end of our combat mission there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the work of al Qaeda in Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the DOD for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that attack and how bad it was and the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s still no government in Iraq, how can you -- how can the United States go ahead, continue with its plans for the drawdown?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The fact that, as the Vice President said, politics has broken out in Iraq is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 It means that democracy is thriving there already.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a transitional government in place that\'s functioning in a stable fashion, and we\'re confident that they will be able to put together a government.\xc2\xa0 But that fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of competition for who is going to be leading that country is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a political process at work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to affect the schedule?\xc2\xa0 This kind of attack is not going to affect the U.S. schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously helping the Iraqi forces to keep that country secure.\xc2\xa0 Our combat mission ends at the end of the month, but we will still have troops there who are helping to support them as necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- preview tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow in Columbus, the President is going to be visiting with a middle-class family, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s right at their kitchen table -- about some of the concerns that they have about what -- things are going on in the economy.\xc2\xa0 And then afterwards, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go outside and have a conversation with some neighbors and folks from the community about questions and concerns that they have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a town hall?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 But smaller.\xc2\xa0 More like a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he take questions?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He will be taking questions, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From -- that will be folks in the community?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How was the family chosen?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that our folks at the White House talked to local community leaders about finding an appropriate venue where such a conversation could take place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whose house is -- who is hosting the fundraiser in Seattle today, the one at the private residence?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I would check in with the Murray campaign on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The questions that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a town hall we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing?\xc2\xa0 Or he\xe2\x80\x99ll just sit alone with them?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it will be town hall-style, but it will be pretty small -- it will be like 40 people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Bill, I knock on wood as I ask this last one, but after this, the President goes off to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 Is his expectation that that is a genuine vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President is definitely going to spend a little time recharging his batteries.\xc2\xa0 I would, as the spokesman who\xe2\x80\x99s going to go on that trip, encourage anybody else who\xe2\x80\x99s going in the media to think that this is going to be the hardest that they will have ever have worked in their entire lives.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be working every day, early till late, maybe really early in the morning till really late at night, and over the weekend as well.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably never see outside of your bed and breakfast where you\xe2\x80\x99ll be staying.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh.\xc2\xa0 Those of us in print -- that was the schedule, actually.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was your fault.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was all your fault.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- your reverse psychology.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to set expectations appropriately.\xc2\xa0 I know what I said before the last time we went to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard and it turned out a little bit differently.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nJust one last thing on this.\xc2\xa0 So a couple folks have asked me who all is going on the trip.\xc2\xa0 Valerie Jarrett will be out there, as well as Pete Rouse --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan will be on the trip.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there doing spokesman duties.\xc2\xa0 And I think Denis McDonough is going to show up at some point to help out as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any other details about where they\xe2\x80\x99re staying, what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, or who\xe2\x80\x99s going with them for vacation purposes?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not other than that, really.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as far as what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, I think it will be a lot like last year.\xc2\xa0 There will be some hiking, some time at the beach, some time at the ice cream store -- all the sort of things you do when you\xe2\x80\x99re at Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 You enjoy the people and the good food.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be playing golf?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Say that again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Golf?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to wait to see how it all shakes out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re staying at the same house?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on where they\xe2\x80\x99re staying.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any plans for a Thursday morning press conference before he leaves and he\xe2\x80\x99s down for 10 days?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 None that I know of.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Anything else?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of the reaction to his comments on the mosque?\xc2\xa0 Has he been sort of -- does he have his -- he\xe2\x80\x99s very critical sometimes of the news media.\xc2\xa0 Is he as critical on this one?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that this is an issue that people are going to come to with strongly held opinions, and he respects the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to express them.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not surprised necessarily that a lot of people are coming out and talking about this forcefully.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that he\xe2\x80\x99s happy that our thriving democracy is continuing to produce vigorous debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not critical -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of those moments where he thinks the media is doing something it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss an opportunity to just criticize the media, but -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is debate that\xe2\x80\x99s just happening in the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have any regrets about coming out and saying anything, given that it\xe2\x80\x99s stoked the flames in this way?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He felt it was his obligation to address this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Bill.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n9:29 A.M.
