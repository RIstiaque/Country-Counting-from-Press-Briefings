GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Joining us in today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing to walk through the developments of the last sort of 24 to 48 hours down in the Gulf are some familiar faces to you all by now:\xc2\xa0 Carol Browner; Admiral Thad Allen -- Retired Admiral Thad Allen; as well as NOAA Administrator Dr. Jane Lubchenco, who will walk us through and update us on where we are in the federal response, walk through an interagency scientific report on where the oil is and the process that it\xe2\x80\x99s gone through.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think you all heard the President discuss today that -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have these guys discuss sort of where we are in the static kill, which is good news, and it is sort of the beginning of the end of the sealing and containment phase of this operation.\xc2\xa0 I want to be, though, very clear, as the President was, that our commitment to those families, to those communities in and along the Gulf Coast remains the same as it always has been.\xc2\xa0 We are transitioning and will transition to a greater focus on cleanup and damage assessment.\xc2\xa0 There is still lots of work to do, and this government will be here every step of the way to do that work.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s an important message from the President.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important that it is heard here, and, as importantly, if not more so, heard in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>So this gives us a chance to look back at what has happened, where we are, as well as to discuss with you guys where we are heading.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will turn this over to Dr. Lubchenco if I can get -- oh, look at that.\xc2\xa0 The gizmo worked.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Today, the federal government is releasing a new scientific analysis that addresses the question:\xc2\xa0 Where did the oil go?\xc2\xa0 This analysis uses the recently released calculation of 4.9 million barrels, plus or minus 10 percent, and includes both direct measurements as well as the best estimates where direct measurements were not possible.</p>\n<p>The report was produced by scientific experts from a number of different agencies, federal agencies, with peer review of the calculations that went into this by both other federal and non-federal scientists.</p>\n<p>The conclusions -- key conclusions of the report is that the vast majority of the oil has either evaporated or been burned, skimmed and recovered from the wellhead, or dispersed.\xc2\xa0 And much of the dispersed oil is in the process of relatively rapid degradation.</p>\n<p>A significant amount of this is a direct result of the very robust federal response efforts.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is just walk you through the pie chart that you see behind us and illustrate what\xe2\x80\x99s in each of these different categories.</p>\n<p>A quarter of the oil, about 1.2 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Does somebody want to point while I do this?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Or can I point up here?\xc2\xa0 How can we do this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your professional pointer and you can --</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be Vanna White.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Okay, Vanna.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 About a quarter of the oil has been evaporated or dissolved.\xc2\xa0 This is about 1.2 million barrels.\xc2\xa0 That happens naturally. That\xe2\x80\x99s a natural process.\xc2\xa0 And much of that happened as the oil was being released day to day.</p>\n<p>Moving around, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the upper right, Robert.\xc2\xa0 About 17 percent, or -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, 827,000 barrels were recovered directly from the well site.\xc2\xa0 So we know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got that number measured directly.\xc2\xa0 An additional 5 percent was burned. Another 3 percent was skimmed.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, 8 percent of the oil that was released has been chemically dispersed both with dispersants at the surface, as well as subsea.\xc2\xa0 And so if you total up those five pie charts -- direct recovery, burned, skimmed and chemically dispersed -- that gives you a sense of what the results of the federal effort have been. And it totals about a third of the total amount of oil that has been released.</p>\n<p>Naturally dispersed oil is also -- accounts for 16 percent.\xc2\xa0 As oil was being released from the wellhead or from the riser pipe, it naturally becomes mixed in turbulent conditions and broken up into small, microscopic droplets that remain -- if they are small enough, they remain below the surface of the water.\xc2\xa0 And so 16 percent naturally dispersed; 8 percent chemically dispersed.\xc2\xa0 That oil is in very, very dilute clouds of microscopic droplets beneath the surface.\xc2\xa0 That is in the process of being very rapidly degraded naturally.\xc2\xa0 And so Mother Nature is assisting here considerably.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the pieces of the pie chart that we have looked at directly now account for those things that we can measure directly or have very good estimates for.</p>\n<p>The residual, which is the upper left part of the pie chart, is 26 percent.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of oil that is in light sheen at the surface, or in tar balls, or has been washed ashore.\xc2\xa0 And much of that has been recovered by federal cleanup efforts and state cleanup efforts.</p>\n<p>About 37,000 tons of material have been removed from the beaches already and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 So I think the bottom line here is that the -- we can account for all but about 26 percent.\xc2\xa0 And of that, much of that is being -- in the process of being degraded and cleaned up on the shore.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to point out that at least 50 percent of the oil that was released is now completely gone from the system.\xc2\xa0 And most of the remainder is degrading rapidly or is being removed from the beaches.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I want to also point out simply that we continue to have a very aggressive effort to understand more about where the oil was and what its fate has been.\xc2\xa0 A large number of research vessels continue to be active in the Gulf, and they\xe2\x80\x99re underway to understand the concentrations of subsurface oil and exactly what -- the rate at which it is being biodegraded.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to monitor and sample this oil and report new results as they emerge.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jane.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 The last 24 hours have been fairly consequential in the life cycle of this response.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go over a couple of things that have transpired.</p>\n<p>After a successful injection test yesterday allowed us to understand the path at which liquids would go down the well, the amount of volume we could put in the well and the pressure readings that we could take at the various places where the gages were placed gave us confidence we could go ahead.\xc2\xa0 And we directed BP to proceed with the static kill.</p>\n<p>That began yesterday afternoon and went on throughout the evening and into the night and resulted in the well being filled with mud.\xc2\xa0 We now have equalized the pressure -- the hydrostatic pressure of the seawater with the pressure inside the capping stack, and basically have reached a static condition in the well that allows us to have high confidence that there will be no oil leaking into the environment. And we have significantly improved our chances to finally kill the well with the relief wells when that does occur.</p>\n<p>The discussions that are going on today between the science team down in Houston and the BP engineers are regarding whether or not we should follow up the mud that has been put into the wellbore with actual cement.\xc2\xa0 And the discussion around that revolves around what we think the status of the drill pipe is:\xc2\xa0 Is it still where we thought it was?\xc2\xa0 Because where that drill pipe is, is consequential in how you put the cement in and the success of cementing it.</p>\n<p>Those discussions are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 We will not make a decision on that until we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached a resolution on our best estimate of what the condition of the drill pipe is inside the casing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Once the decision has been made on cementing, whether to cement or not, then the next step will be to finish off the relief well.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we are about 100 feet away from where we would intersect the well and about four and a half feet horizontally away from it.</p>\n<p>We would proceed forward in anywhere between 10- and 20-foot increments, drilling and then backing out and putting what we call a ranging tool in that will allow us to understand to exact detail through a measurement of the magnetic field of the casing how close we were coming.</p>\n<p>We will continue to do that. This job will not be complete until we finish the relief well and have pumped the mud in and cemented it from the bottom, or the bottom kill, if you will.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a very significant step.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s told us a lot more about the well itself.\xc2\xa0 We will learn more in the discussions today about whether or not we need to move to have cementing as the final portion of the static kill.\xc2\xa0 But the static kill is only the preliminary portion to what ultimately will be the bottom kill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Regarding response operations, we continue to aggressively pursue the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s onshore and in the marsh areas, some of the more heavily impacted areas around Barataria Bay to the west of the Mississippi River, the Chandeleur Islands, Breton Sound, Pass a Loutre, some areas in the Mississippi Sound.\xc2\xa0 We are resolute in our commitment to continue that response and cleanup.\xc2\xa0 Our forces are standing by.</p>\n<p>While we look to have an end to the source of the oil and containment, we are redoubling our efforts to make sure that the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s out there is being cleaned up and being disposed of as effectively as possible.</p>\n<p>We will continue to do that, and we will resolutely hold BP accountable until all the oil is cleaned up and we start moving into the recovery phase and the assessment of damage to the environment.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, it\xe2\x80\x99s been an interesting 24 hours, I think making real progress in terms of getting this well finally closed.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we are not going to have any more leaking in the near term is certainly good news for the Gulf of Mexico and the communities.</p>\n<p>I think we also have good information now from our scientists in terms of where the oil went, how the oil is behaving.\xc2\xa0 But we want to be very, very clear that this does not mean there isn\xe2\x80\x99t more to be done.\xc2\xa0 There remains a lot to be done.\xc2\xa0 While sort of the first phase of closing the well may be coming to an end, there\xe2\x80\x99s another phase, which is the restoration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that these communities, the individuals in these communities, are made whole.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are going to continue to ensure that BP is held accountable for the damage that they did, for the economic losses, and ultimately for the natural resource damages and all of the restoration that will take place in the Gulf communities and in the Gulf at large.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With that, Ms. Loven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, this would be I guess both for Carol and for Dr. Lubchenco.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, some outside scientists have some concerns about such a sort of neat and tidy conclusion to where the oil has gone.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether it\xe2\x80\x99s -- whether that definitive of a conclusion is really warranted with science, and why you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t release the pages of scientific backup to show how it was arrived at.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 We believe that these are the best direct measurements or estimates that we have at the moment.\xc2\xa0 We have high degree of confidence in them.\xc2\xa0 If new information comes to light, we will continue to upgrade the estimates, as is always the case in science.</p>\n<p>The numbers that went into the calculations are posted on the website.\xc2\xa0 Anyone can readily see how the budget calculator was -- how the tool was developed, what\xe2\x80\x99s in it, what went into each of those different categories, how they are defined, how it was calculated.\xc2\xa0 So we would certainly welcome others using that tool and fact-checking, running the numbers.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll come up with the same estimates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you seek new estimates or is this sort of your last attempt to look at where this amount of oil has gone?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of the numbers are clearly not going to change.\xc2\xa0 The amount of oil that was captured from the wellhead we know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right --</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 The amount that has been skimmed and burned is not likely to change.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just very little oil on the surface now.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not much oil that is visible other than right along the shore and on some of the beaches.\xc2\xa0 So those numbers are not going to change.</p>\n<p>The amount that was chemically dispersed is not likely to change; we\xe2\x80\x99re not using dispersants anymore. The amount that was naturally dispersed is a result of direct calculations of how much turbulence there was and what we know about how oil behaves at different depths under pressure.\xc2\xa0 The amount that was evaporated or dissolved is I think a pretty good estimate.</p>\n<p>So the one piece of the pie that is left after you sum all those others is what we\xe2\x80\x99re calling the residual, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of things that we cannot measure directly or estimate with confidence.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just to add to that, I mean, I think, to mention this -- Dr. Lubchenco just mentioned on the residual -- some of this is oil that, in tar balls, has, as she said earlier, washed up on the beach.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been removed but isn\xe2\x80\x99t measurable because you\xe2\x80\x99re removing it -- you may remove this with sand.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the 37,000 tons.\xc2\xa0 So some of the 26 is immeasurable or unknowable.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 I also want to point out one thing, and that is that there are three categories on your pie chart that have a little asterisk by them -- residual, naturally and chemically dispersed.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that each of those categories is being -- the oil in those categories is being degraded, naturally degraded.\xc2\xa0 And so some of the residual that might be in marshes, for example, or tar balls is being biodegraded.\xc2\xa0 The oil that is beneath the surface as a result of dispersion and these microscopic droplets is in the process of rapid degradation.\xc2\xa0 And so what you see on this pie chart, as Robert indicated, is a sum total of where the oil went over time.\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily represent what\xe2\x80\x99s there at this moment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up really quickly, if any of you all could speak to what you think the level of NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s credibility should be on a conclusion this dramatic -- potentially pivotal, when there were points in the process when NOAA was insisting the amount of oil that was leaking or that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any under the surface that turned out not to be right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take that question because it would be unfair to say that NOAA had come up with one number during this process, or that NOAA alone bears responsibility, because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that -- look, throughout the process of this response, we have had the benefit of greater insight and greater technology.\xc2\xa0 So at the beginning of this event, the explosion, the flow rate was measured by taking pictures of what had floated to the surface, okay?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think by all accounts -- that happens in the first couple days.\xc2\xa0 I think by all accounts even we would tell you that\xe2\x80\x99s not the best way to measure the flow rate.\xc2\xa0 But that was the best way we had at that point to measure the flow rate.</p>\n<p>We know that as a result of adding remotely operated vehicles to the site, we had the benefit of somewhat cloudy, two-dimensional video.\xc2\xa0 Throughout the process, that video was enhanced and upgraded to the point where we had, as you all remember, we went from the cloudier to the much clearer two-dimensional video.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, even the two-dimensional video is hard to estimate because you just simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know the depth of that plume.\xc2\xa0 Lastly, based on the pressure test that we required BP to take, we were able to add instrumentation on -- at the point at these caps that allowed us to measure the pressure both inside and directly outside of the caps and the blowout preventer, which gave us, quite frankly, a better scientific measure.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve used this analogy before, but I think I want to take one more time to do this.\xc2\xa0 It is important to understand that this event happened 5,000 feet below the surface at a well that was several miles below that 5,000-foot point.\xc2\xa0 It is measuring -- we were measuring the flow rate basically of an opened Coke can 5,000 feet below the ocean using the best available technology that we had at the time without the benefit of knowing how big the Coke can was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you\xe2\x80\x99re now measuring something --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- very complicated again --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and saying that you have a definitive answer now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Using -- but -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of us would sit up here and tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re using the same instrumentation or information that was available to us on day one on day 106 because that simply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case with the flow rate, and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case with any of this.</p>\n<p>I will say this, to build off of the last question that you had, Jennifer, NOAA will continue to make measurements of the water and monitor what is happening in the Gulf, just as the EPA will continue to monitor air and water for dispersants and for air quality as it\xe2\x80\x99s related to burns.\xc2\xa0 That -- the testing will continue, but our information and our instrumentation has at each step in this process gotten better simply because when we started this, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a picture of what was going on down 5,000 below the ocean.\xc2\xa0 We added pictures.\xc2\xa0 We added enhanced pictures.\xc2\xa0 We added pressure readings.\xc2\xa0 All of that allows you to get a much clearer and much more precise picture of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add another point?\xc2\xa0 This has all been -- as Dr. Lubchenco said -- been subjected to a scientific protocol, which means you peer review, peer review and peer review.\xc2\xa0 You look at what the inputs are.\xc2\xa0 You look at what the models are.\xc2\xa0 All of this has been made available.</p>\n<p>And so this has been a government-wide effort, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just government scientists who looked at this.\xc2\xa0 You reached out to the academic community, had them look at this as the models were being developed.\xc2\xa0 And as Robert just said and as Jane said herself, we may get more information, for example, about the residuals such that some of that may fit into another part of the pie chart.</p>\n<p>But what we have tried to do from the beginning is as we have numbers make them available knowing that they may change.\xc2\xa0 I think in this instance there could be some change -- the likelihood of large-scale changes is very, very small because we have so much certainty in some of the numbers.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can -- we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could certainly dismiss the role that Mother Nature has played.\xc2\xa0 And you can see the role that it\xe2\x80\x99s played in this pie chart.</p>\n<p>And, look, would we be talking about a fundamentally different scenario in Alaska than we would in the warm waters of the Gulf?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But that has to be taken into account in the natural degradation and evaporation process that is a result of an environment, quite frankly, that is not the same as Prince William Sound in Alaska.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s been dissolved or dispersed, I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s degraded.\xc2\xa0 But how can you be sure that it really isn\xe2\x80\x99t a threat any more to the wildlife?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 No one is saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a threat any more.\xc2\xa0 The oil that has been completely degraded isn\xe2\x80\x99t because when it is biodegraded it ends up being water and carbon dioxide.\xc2\xa0 So if it has been biodegraded, if it\xe2\x80\x99s gone, then it\xe2\x80\x99s not a threat.</p>\n<p>Oil that is in microscopic droplets that is still there may be toxic to any of the small creatures under the water that are encountered -- that it encounters.\xc2\xa0 And even in very small droplets it is -- can be toxic.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We do remain concerned and are actively studying the overall impact that both the oil at the surface and the oil subsurface has had on the entire ecosystem of the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 The oil that is beneath the surface is in the process of very rapid degradation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s disappearing very quickly.\xc2\xa0 It is very dilute.\xc2\xa0 As you go farther and farther from the wellhead, the small microscopic droplets of oil are very quickly diluted into parts per million -- parts per million, that\xe2\x80\x99s very, very dilute.\xc2\xa0 And farther away from the wellhead, it\xe2\x80\x99s even more dilute.</p>\n<p>But diluted and out of sight doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean benign.\xc2\xa0 And we remain concerned about the long-term impacts, both on the marshes and the wildlife, but also beneath the surface, and are actively studying that, both as part of our federal response and in partnership with much of the academic community that is also very interested in the overall long-term impacts of this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And Caren, again, to mention, again, the EPA will -- has done two rounds of toxicity tests. They will continue to monitor and do testing, as will NOAA, in order for us to continue to monitor and get a better understanding.</p>\n<p>Yunji.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back in May, Tony Hayward said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean; the amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 After he said that, the President said that he would have fired Mr. Hayward since he said those comments.\xc2\xa0 Now it appears that Mr. Hayward may in fact have been right.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration owe him an apology?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that a third of what is captured was based on -- directly on a containment strategy that had to be constructed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, a containment strategy that we pushed BP forward on, that we pushed BP to accelerate in order to capture the oil that was leaking.</p>\n<p>Nobody owes Tony Hayward an apology.\xc2\xa0 BP has responsibilities and obligations as the responsible polluting party in this instance.\xc2\xa0 Our government will ensure that the obligations and responsibilities that BP has continue to be met to our satisfaction.</p>\n<p>The apology that is owed by -- any apology that is owed is to the disruption to the lives of families, fishermen, hotel owners, people that grew up in and understand the beauty that is the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the apology.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of the successes today that you\xe2\x80\x99re laying out for us is attributable to BP, and how much to the federal government?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that you had to push BP to get here?\xc2\xa0 I see you\xe2\x80\x99re nodding your head.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- again, I think if you go back and look at the directives signed by Admiral Allen to various people in the corporate structure at BP, we asked for and demanded that particularly their containment strategy be accelerated.\xc2\xa0 We asked for and demanded that not one relief well be drilled, but two, in order to ensure an amount of redundancy in the system that would allow for a mistake or an error.</p>\n<p>I think that the response as it is would have been different had Admiral Allen and others -- Carol, Jane, the scientific team, Secretary Chu -- not pushed at every step of the way for BP to do things more comprehensively and faster.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think all of you mentioned the last 24 hours have been eventful.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet heard how the President was informed of this.\xc2\xa0 I know if maybe, Carol, you briefed him.\xc2\xa0 Was this a phone call to him?\xc2\xa0 Was there something in person?\xc2\xa0 What was the moment where the President saw that maybe this part of the -- this phase had succeeded, and what was his reaction?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The President is briefed virtually every day and has been from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 I speak to him virtually every day, either through a memo, or most days I actually meet with him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Today was actually the first day he was happy to see her.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 He thanked me for his birthday present.\xc2\xa0 Last night after I got off the call with our scientists and Admiral Allen, I suggested to the President that it would be important to talk to our scientific team that was in -- that are in Houston.\xc2\xa0 He got on the phone with Dr. Chu, with Dr. Hunter, who walked him sort of through where the static kill was and what might occur.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I then briefed him again this morning.\xc2\xa0 But he has been kept informed and up to date at every turn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time was that call?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The call was approximately 6:30 p.m., 7:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 We released a photo from it.\xc2\xa0 So approximately 6:30 p.m. or 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and again, we met with him at 10:00 a.m. this morning to give him an update.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And the Admiral saw him at about 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 10:30 a.m., yes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will continue to get updates throughout the day, as Admiral Allen said, as the scientific team continues its meetings -- Secretary Chu and others down there talking directly with the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of oil.\xc2\xa0 I think that the residual -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s still about four to five times the amount that leaked from the Exxon Valdez --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re still talking -- is it still possible that it could get into -- and I know some of it\xe2\x80\x99s in the 37,000 gallons -- right, right, right -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s still a monumental amount of oil.\xc2\xa0 Is it still possible that it could --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, Chip, this is the largest release of oil into water in the United States in the history of our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But could we still have a scenario where it gets into the Loop Current, hits Florida beaches, goes around Florida, or in a hurricane gets driven ashore --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the original scenario was off the coast of Delaware and halfway to England by September, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let scientists discuss -- except you\xe2\x80\x99re the only scientist.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 There is a negligible amount of oil still at the surface.\xc2\xa0 The Loop Current is currently not in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 It is going pretty much directly -- it comes up between the Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And it goes pretty much directly into the Florida Strait.\xc2\xa0 So it is not in a position to transport any oil, number one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to stay where it is?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 It may connect eventually, but the real point is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no oil for it to be picking up.\xc2\xa0 The oil that was at the surface has pretty much either been naturally degraded or removed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there subsurface currents, too?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 There are -- pardon me?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t there subsurface currents too?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 The Loop Current does have both a surface expression and a subsurface expression. But the oil that is -- we do not expect the Loop Current to become in its classic form, i.e., going into the Gulf, for a number of weeks, if not months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the rate at which the oil that is subsurface is being naturally biodegraded is such that there\xe2\x80\x99s virtually no threat to the Keys or to the East Coast remaining.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And hurricane danger?\xc2\xa0 Of it being pushed ashore?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Again, because there is so little oil at the surface and the oil beneath the surface is so highly dilute, the largest concern from a hurricane would be the hurricane itself, the power of the winds, the power of the storm surge, should that happen.</p>\n<p>In most hurricanes that happen in coastal waters, there is some leaking of oil as a result of fuel tanks being breached, ship docks being impacted.\xc2\xa0 So the likelihood that a hurricane would be affecting coastal areas with petroleum contamination is part of what FEMA and states normally have to deal with as part of a hurricane response. There is no additional, at this point, real concern with respect to any of the Deepwater Horizon oil relative to any hurricanes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doctor, what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between naturally dispersed oil and that that is dissolved?\xc2\xa0 One question.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And two, what do all of these findings mean for shrimpers and fishermen?\xc2\xa0 When can they get back to work?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Dissolving simply means taking something that is in a more solid form and making it liquid.\xc2\xa0 So if you put a teaspoon of sugar into your coffee or your teacup, it dissolves.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what happens naturally to some of the oil.\xc2\xa0 It is dissolved, meaning that it is -- it still is hydrocarbon --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s different than being dispersed?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Dispersed means broken up from large chunks into smaller chunks, if you will.\xc2\xa0 So the dispersed oil is just little tiny droplets that then remain beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One less threatening than the other?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 No, they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty comparable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what does this mean for fishermen and shrimpers?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 As you know, part of the federal response has been to make protecting the quality of seafood that gets to American consumers one of the highest priorities.\xc2\xa0 To do that, our first line of defense has been to close federal waters to fishing where there has been oil, or where we anticipated it might be as it was being moved by currents and by the winds.</p>\n<p>At one point, about 36 percent of the Gulf was closed -- of the federal waters in the Gulf were closed to fishing.\xc2\xa0 Last -- was it last week that we announced -- recently, we announced opening of a third of that area, so there is still a sizeable area that is closed to fishing in federal waters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To determine whether areas are safe to reopen, we have a very specific protocol that NOAA and the Food and Drug Administration and the Gulf States have all agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 That involves actively testing seafood for contaminants and only when they pass those tests is an area -- can an area be reopened.\xc2\xa0 So the first goal here is to protect the quality of the seafood, make sure that no contaminated seafood gets into the markets, to restaurants or whatever.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The consequence to shrimpers and to fishermen remains to be calculated.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, there has been very significant disruption to them, to their livelihoods.\xc2\xa0 And our hope is to get them back fishing as soon as possible, but only when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe for them to be doing so and for the seafood that they\xe2\x80\x99re catching to be edible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s really no reassurance for them in today\xe2\x80\x99s findings?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 I think the reassurance is that most of the oil is gone from the surface.\xc2\xa0 And so we can proceed with following the reopening protocols as rapidly as possible.\xc2\xa0 We will do that carefully and in partnership with the states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The states regulate what happens in state waters.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear about this.\xc2\xa0 The federal government is only responsible for federal waters.\xc2\xa0 And the impact to fishermen is obviously quite considerable and is of serious concern to all of us.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the federal effort to address and to hold BP accountable for the consequence of this to those -- to the fishermen.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only 8 percent chemically dispersed.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to revisit the use of these chemical dispersants considering that, A, it only accounted for 8 percent of getting rid of it, and B, the concerns that are out there among some health organizations and some scientists about the effects of these dispersants?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this has been a topic that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed extensively over the last couple of months.\xc2\xa0 As we got into the spill, we were using preexisting protocols that are authorized under law for the use of dispersants, so the use of dispersants is not illegal.\xc2\xa0 It is consistent with schedules that are put out by EPA.</p>\n<p>But it became very apparent early on that the amount that we were using was far more than was ever anticipated.\xc2\xa0 And we had to start to move into the subsea category to try and control the oil at the source.\xc2\xa0 There was extensive consultation between myself and Lisa Jackson.\xc2\xa0 Jane Lubchenco has been involved in it.\xc2\xa0 That resulted in a 25th of May agreement to reduce dispersant use by 75 percent; as of the time the well was capped, we had reduced it 72 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that there would have to be exceptions where you had oil that was going to have a dramatic impact should it come ashore, that you could not burn or skim -- there was no other way to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 On the 22nd of June, I agreed with Lisa Jackson we would put somebody from EPA into the review process down at the Unified Area Command.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work this problem going forward.</p>\n<p>Just prior to the capping stack being put on, I convened a conference call with Jane, Lisa Jackson, Marcia McNutt and some other folks to talk about the interplay between skimming, burning, use of dispersants and the tools that are available to our commanders that are out there.</p>\n<p>We have never had to use these tools on the order of magnitude they were employed during this response. I think a very thoughtful analysis of how they were employed, the effectiveness that was achieved, is going to be necessary going forward.\xc2\xa0 And we, in fact, had started to engage in that discussion while the spill was going on.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The well has been capped. There\xe2\x80\x99s no oil out there right now.\xc2\xa0 The questions remain.\xc2\xa0 And I think any commission work or any follow-on work needs to take a look at the relative effectiveness of all those tools and should guide future policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like the idea of maybe chemical dispersants, considering what they accounted for, maybe can easily be avoided?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ought to jump to that conclusion because oil is very toxic.\xc2\xa0 And there are times when you cannot skim and you cannot burn, and you have to make a decision on how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with that.\xc2\xa0 And those are tactical decisions our commanders make on the scene.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add a little context to this because, Chuck, we spend a lot of time in here and you all spend a lot of time covering not enough skimmers, right?\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s almost three times the amount of oil was chemically dispersed as was skimmed, despite the fact that we were -- and we now have I think on the order of, probably in the region somewhere between 700 and 800 skimmers, right?\xc2\xa0 So 8 percent may not sound like a lot.\xc2\xa0 The amount -- again, we were using this also at a subsea -- at the wellhead in a way that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been used before.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the toxicity, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate what I said earlier -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send this around to everybody. On Monday, the EPA put out the second of its toxicity tests on oil dispersants.\xc2\xa0 The tests showed that what they found was no more toxic than the oil.</p>\n<p>So the notion that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have huge amounts of it washing up at Port St. Joe, or --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but there has been a concern that dispersant and oil together actually can -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been some -- and I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not been government scientists that said this concern that the combination actually could be more --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that concern has -- is why EPA tested before, tested and released those results on Monday, which showed that despite a hypothesis that that plus the oil might increase the toxicity, that was found not to be true.\xc2\xa0 And EPA will continue to monitor the area as we go forward so that we have a better understanding of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 And Chuck, that test specifically focused on mixing the oil with the dispersants and found out that it was the more greater toxicity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the moratorium, the drilling moratorium.\xc2\xa0 Considering where we are now, any consideration being given by the administration to speed up the lifting of this moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we talked about this this morning, and I think it is -- I think we should be clear about this.\xc2\xa0 The President -- this is a -- the President put in place a temporary deepwater drilling moratorium.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and he has said, this was not and is not intended to be a permanent ban on deepwater drilling. But the President I think has laid out a series of fairly common-sense tests that he believes have to be met.\xc2\xa0 What happened?\xc2\xa0 Do we have a full understanding of what in this well went wrong?\xc2\xa0 How do we ensure, understanding that, that it never happens again?\xc2\xa0 In other words, was this a one-off event based on circumstances at this well?\xc2\xa0 Was this a problem with technology that exists on wells throughout the Gulf?\xc2\xa0 How do we understand that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then thirdly, ensuring that companies that are undertaking what we know is a risky venture 5,000 feet below the ocean, making sure that these companies have a containment plan that\xe2\x80\x99s commensurate with the type of activity they\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, in short, no plans to speed up any --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me finish.\xc2\xa0 So once all three of those can be met, the President will lift that moratorium.\xc2\xa0 And if those conditions can be met before the end of November, we\xe2\x80\x99d certainly happily do that.\xc2\xa0 We just want to ensure, from a very common-sense standpoint, that those conditions and those tests are, to the best of the ability of those involved, understood and accounted for.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to -- all the weeks now tend to blur together -- but the oil companies with drilling permits in the Gulf have discussed and made mention of both a fund and a more comprehensive series of plans to contain the oil.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Remember, when we were discussing this in the very beginning, the advent of the oil moratorium would be, every one of these rigs would go somewhere else. That also, in the numbers in which those predictions were made, those numbers have not come to fruition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a non-spill question.\xc2\xa0 You want me to wait?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get to how this report will be used as the basis for the legal case against BP.\xc2\xa0 For example, the 827,000 barrels of oil recovered at the well site, will that form the basis of the fines?\xc2\xa0 Will BP be fined for that oil?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave -- we only have one scientist and we have no lawyers that I know of -- are you a lawyer?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I went to law school.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Well, are you a lawyer or an attorney?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a Justice Department attorney.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the legal questions up to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Understand that the law provides for and Justice will go through the process of adjudicating -- the law calls for a per-barrel fine I think of up to -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s $4,300 per barrel per day that BP could be -- that BP will be liable for.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll get a -- they are getting bills from us on -- for cleanup activities now.\xc2\xa0 They will get a bill and a penalty for the amount of pollution emitted into the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 They will also be on the hook for natural resource damage assessments for the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been done, as well as the $20 billion that\xe2\x80\x99s in the escrow fund to compensate for the economic claims of the damage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You cite a variety of scientists who participated in preparing this report.\xc2\xa0 Did some of BP\xe2\x80\x99s own scientists or any from the oil industry participate?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 The names of all of the people who participated in the report and the calculations that went into it are listed in the report, so you can actually look at them.\xc2\xa0 There were individuals from the oil industry who did some of the peer review, but they were not involved in the original calculations.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have some numbers you want to --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing math back here.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 So the question was the amount that was chemically dispersed, which is the 8 percent figure that\xe2\x80\x99s here, is a little over 400,000 barrels.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what that equates to.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s about twice the size of the Exxon Valdez spill, just to give you a sense, just to put that in context.*</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, are you able to answer Robert\xe2\x80\x99s question about what went wrong at the well?\xc2\xa0 Do you yet have an understanding of what happened that caused all this and how other drillers can avoid it?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, most of that will be the result of the Marine Board of Investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s currently being convened in New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s jointly by Homeland Security and Department of Interior.\xc2\xa0 That is ongoing and I would refer any questions to that.</p>\n<p>Obviously, as we look at controlling the well itself, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find out where the drill pipe is at and what the condition of the pipe is.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where it\xe2\x80\x99s at, and that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the subject of some of the discussions today about how the cementing should proceed.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly the condition of the annulus.\xc2\xa0 We are going to have to take the blowout preventer off and take a look at it.</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all a story that\xe2\x80\x99s still unfolding.\xc2\xa0 By the time we finish the static kill and the bottom kill, we\xe2\x80\x99ll know more about it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a definitive answer until those other actions are taken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have an idea?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Roger.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, early on in the spill, government scientists said that the effects of the spill would linger for I think it was around 10 years or something like that -- some big number.\xc2\xa0 As a result of the evaporation and the collection and stuff that you have today, has that assessment changed or is it still 10 years?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 I think the common view of most of the scientists inside and outside government is that the effects of this spill will likely linger for decades.\xc2\xa0 The fact that so much of the oil has been removed and in the process of being degraded is very significant and means that the impact will not be even worse than it might have been.\xc2\xa0 But the oil that was released and has already impacted wildlife at the surface, young juvenile stages and eggs beneath the surface, will likely have very considerable impacts for years and possibly decades to come.</p>\n<p>The research investigations that are underway now are designed to get a better handle on exactly what that impact is, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that is easy to determine.\xc2\xa0 For example, bluefin tuna, who spawn at the time -- this time of year, have eggs and young juvenile stages called larvae that would have been in the water column when the oil was present.\xc2\xa0 If those eggs or larvae were exposed to oil, they probably would have died or been significantly impacted.\xc2\xa0 And we won\xe2\x80\x99t see the full result of that for a number of years to come.</p>\n<p>This is one of the challenges of getting a handle on the impact of a spill like this.\xc2\xa0 The total amount of oil was immense, and the impact is likely to continue to be considerable, even though Mother Nature is helping assist the federal effort and we\xe2\x80\x99re aggressively removing as much as possible and it is degrading rapidly. But the impact of the oil that was released is likely to be considerable.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking at the residual 26 percent, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to measure exactly how much of that has been scooped up, but can you give us any idea of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a small fraction of that, a majority, somewhere in the middle?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we know we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered I think 36,000 or 37,000 tons of debris.\xc2\xa0 Some of that, if it\xe2\x80\x99s just sand and oil, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a higher concentration of sand than if it was on wood -- could be marsh grass and some other areas.</p>\n<p>So this is not going to be an exact science in how we try and figure out exactly what the implications of that oil is.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We can anecdotally understand -- try and understand what it is from what we recovered mechanically, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take us a while to actually get our arms around this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, is there any re-evaluation of the use of skimmers, given that so much effort was put into the skimmers and it was 3 percent of the total oil?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this gets back to the discussion we had earlier.\xc2\xa0 I think there needs to be an evaluation of all the interventions that were used.\xc2\xa0 And even among the skimmers themselves, there are different types of skimmers.\xc2\xa0 There are skimmers that basically collect the oil then have it vacuumed.\xc2\xa0 There are skimmers that are called oleophilic skimmers where you have material that oil actually sticks to and then you scrape it off.\xc2\xa0 And I think when we\xe2\x80\x99re all done we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to go back and say, moving forward, as we create an inventory of response tools, what really served us best in this response.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, again, just to do the math with these guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three percent is a lot.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Three percent is almost an Exxon-Valdez.\xc2\xa0 So you can be the judge of the --</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Robert, could I just clarify that the residual category is a combination of things that cannot be easily measured or estimated.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s left over when you can measure and estimate all those other categories.\xc2\xa0 And then to make a total to 100 percent, there\xe2\x80\x99s that 26 percent.\xc2\xa0 So this should not be interpreted as oil that is still out there necessarily.\xc2\xa0 Some of it may be.\xc2\xa0 Some of it has already been degraded.\xc2\xa0 Some of it has already been collected.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not still out there.\xc2\xa0 Twenty-six isn\xe2\x80\x99t still out there.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not actually putting out a \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished\xe2\x80\x9d banner on this, but, Admiral Allen, is today a day that marks a change in what this incident is, a change in what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xc2\xa0 How different does today make the entire incident?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think Robert said, this is the beginning of the end of a phase.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get caught up in semantics.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a consequential day.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve significantly reduced the threat of hydrocarbons into the environment that have plagued us for a long, long time, and we took a major step on the 15th of July when we put the capping stack on.\xc2\xa0 This is an insurance measure and it will bring the whole thing home when we actually kill the bottom of the well.</p>\n<p>But I think everybody needs to understand there is a continuum of activities.\xc2\xa0 We want to reassure the people in the Gulf Coast and the people of the nation that this is just one phase of what you have to do to respond when you have an oil spill, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the on-the-water and the source control.\xc2\xa0 It has to do with the beach cleanup, and it has to do with the long-term environmental damage.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work to do, but the nature of the work will change.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, the type of resources, how we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching it, will have to change, too, because we have a different set of activities we have to deal with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we take great encouragement from what\xe2\x80\x99s happened today?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, given the fact this is such a -- the magnitude of this event, I think we can have some optimism that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to deal with oil that was indeterminate.\xc2\xa0 You heard me say it was indeterminate, omni-directional.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to bound it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bounded now.\xc2\xa0 It is bounded.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the timeframe from today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would just say this, Sam.\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why -- well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of reasons why there\xe2\x80\x99s no \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished\xe2\x80\x9d banner -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and I would go back, direct you not to what I said but direct you to what Thad just said and more importantly what the President said.\xc2\xa0 The reason why we are moving to focusing on a different phase is because we have -- we are nearing the completion of the killing of this well, which was our foremost priority since the leak began.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving the area.\xc2\xa0 And more importantly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving behind any commitment to clean up what\xe2\x80\x99s been -- the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been done and repair and restore the Gulf as an ecosystem of great importance to, obviously, that region of the country, but to the country as a whole.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, most of you have repeatedly said that the 26 percent is unknowable, it\xe2\x80\x99s immeasurable at this moment, and the estimate of the 4.9 million barrels of what emanated from this well is also an estimate.\xc2\xa0 So couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the actual amount of oil out there that has leached through the coast or is still somewhere under the surface, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be considerably more than the 26 percent?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that number -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve been accused before of initially rosy estimates -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t the 26 percent, which seems particularly reassuring --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to refer you to the fairly lengthy answer I gave on this about 30 minutes ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, but the number -- the 26 percent number is a reassuring number, it\xe2\x80\x99s meant to reassure folks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s an actual number about where the oil is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a reassurance document.\xc2\xa0 This is a compendium --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a statistically significant --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a compendium of where the oil is.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I want to be clear, the flow rate -- we have a greater understanding and greater access to information based on directives that we have issued, based on instrumentation that is 5,000 feet below the ocean that allow us to measure the flow rate now far better than we did on day one with photographs of overflights.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, maybe I can summarize here.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 As this incident has evolved, we have come up with great clarify and organizational structure on how we want to measure flow rate.\xc2\xa0 Let me just tell you some of the major component parts because this is not arbitrary and capricious and Marcia McNutt has done a great job leading her group.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are about three or four pieces to determining the flow rate.\xc2\xa0 The first one is created by what we call the mass balance team.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s trying to understand exactly how much oil is out there that we can see and measure on the water.\xc2\xa0 This is everything from satellite imagery to some very sophisticated NASA aircraft that actually look at the reflectivity of the surface of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 And it varies whether or not you have oil or water and actually give you a thickness estimate related to that.</p>\n<p>The second one is the plume analysis.\xc2\xa0 And there are two different ways to look at that.\xc2\xa0 As Robert said, it\xe2\x80\x99s moving from two-dimensional to three-dimensional.\xc2\xa0 We also had acoustic testing done on that stream by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.\xc2\xa0 We have a reservoir modeling team.\xc2\xa0 As the reservoir has been depleted, that changes the pressure coming up and we know now that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a linear -- there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same amount of flow every day.\xc2\xa0 It changed based on the pressure that was coming up from the reservoir.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And finally, we had a nodal analysis team that looked at where the oil was at at different particular stages as it came forward.\xc2\xa0 And so we had different ways to look at this and bring it together.</p>\n<p>We started out -- I think it was 12 to 25 and 19 to 25; based on better information, we went from 35 to 60. We bracketed it.\xc2\xa0 And then lately we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to get the better pressure measurements as the capping stack went on.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to refine this.</p>\n<p>It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stop.\xc2\xa0 It just means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting better and better at getting the information and putting that together and creating a picture.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.\xc2\xa0 You want to add something to that?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 The flow rate of 4.9, which is what Admiral Allen has been talking about, has the plus or minus 10 percent, so that would be between 4.4 and 5.4.\xc2\xa0 And the -- if we focus on the residual part of the pie chart, the 26 percent is at the intermediate number.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s at the 4.6 million barrel number.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you want to know what the percent of the residual is for the full plus or minus 10 percent, it ranges from 24 percent to 28 percent.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that some of the numbers are direct -- in the pie chart -- are direct measurements such as the oil that was recovered from the wellhead.\xc2\xa0 So that number is an absolute number.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change.\xc2\xa0 And so when you do the calculations to come up with the percentage, the amount that is residual, we feel quite comfortable saying that it is most likely around 26 percent. It might be as low as 24 percent; it might be as high as 28 percent.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be significantly different from that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the certainty there\xe2\x80\x99s not an oil coating on the ocean floor, with all your charts and information?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of research vessels that are out on the water, imaging or using remotely operated vehicles or gliders to determine exactly where the oil is subsurface and what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing where it is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no oil that is accumulating on the seafloor.\xc2\xa0 We have no evidence that there is any oil that is sitting on the bottom or sinking down to the bottom.\xc2\xa0 The oil that did not rise to the surface, that was not light enough to make it to the surface, is the oil that has been dispersed, either naturally or chemically.\xc2\xa0 And that is in very small, microscopic droplets.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s primarily between 3,300 and 4,300 feet as a very diffuse cloud that is in concentrations that diminish as you go away from the wellhead.\xc2\xa0 And that is the oil that is in the process of being naturally degraded.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the oil that is beneath the surface.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s microscopic.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s dilute.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, in your talking, you gave an example earlier about blue tuna, the larvae of this blue tuna.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean, with that example and others, does that mean that you will be testing -- the federal government will be testing for decades the seafood out of the Gulf?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for giving me an opportunity to clarify that.\xc2\xa0 Fish metabolize hydrocarbons relatively rapidly.\xc2\xa0 And so if an adult fish or a fish that would be the size that fishermen would catch and bring to market, if that fish is exposed to oil, it might be contaminated initially, but it metabolizes.\xc2\xa0 It naturally breaks down the oil.\xc2\xa0 And so after a period of time on the order of weeks, that fish is no longer unfit for human consumption.\xc2\xa0 It has broken down the hydrocarbons, and it is safe to eat.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what we are testing to make sure that that process -- that natural process has happened, and that the seafood is safe.</p>\n<p>The example that I gave you for bluefin tuna was to illustrate that our interest is not only in the fish that are recognizable as fish that are out there now, but that there are very small microscopic juvenile stages that will -- would have grown up to be a fish many, many years from now.\xc2\xa0 Those are the ones that are of potential concern.\xc2\xa0 Those are more vulnerable than are most of the fish that are live and out swimming around in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long are you expecting to test?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 We will continue to test as long as is needed and we will be following this -- we will be following the impacts of the oil in the Gulf for years, if not decades.</p>\n<p>The seafood testing that we have already done is telling us that it is being degraded naturally and that areas that we are opening have seafood that is safe to eat.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first one follows all of this, both in terms of food safety and also in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with subsurface plumes.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the testing will continue.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us precisely and explicitly how often you will continue to monitor it, whether the monitoring mechanisms will change, whether the pace or the duration of the monitoring will change?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know you\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to do it, but will you do it slightly less frequently?\xc2\xa0 Or are you putting a mandate on it now?\xc2\xa0 Or will things continue exactly as they have been pro forma until some other pronouncement is made?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 So are you asking specifically about the monitoring for seafood safety?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about both the monitoring of seafood safety and the monitoring of the environmental effects in the subsurface plumes.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so let\xe2\x80\x99s keep those in separate categories because the answer is different.\xc2\xa0 For monitoring for seafood safety, we have a very extensive protocol.\xc2\xa0 First of all, when the oil spill first happened, we went out and got a lot of samples of fish and shellfish from around the Gulf to have baseline samples against which we could compare any changes, should they happen.\xc2\xa0 So we have those.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been processed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have a very specific protocol for monitoring and testing areas that we think are the next logical places to be opening -- or to be considered for opening.\xc2\xa0 If an area was only lightly oiled once, then we would consider that a more likely candidate for targeting our testing effort than an area that was repeatedly oiled.\xc2\xa0 So we are going to be monitoring areas where we think it\xe2\x80\x99s logical that there would be a possibility of reopening.\xc2\xa0 When the testing shows it is safe, we will open those areas according to those protocols.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These findings in and of themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t change the schedule or the form or the pace of testing in any way?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s findings just help us understand what has happened in the big picture.\xc2\xa0 It does not modify our efforts to monitor and test for seafood safety, or to monitor and do research on the impacts of the spill on the Gulf at large.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that continues at exactly the same pace until something else says that that should change?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question is, you talked a little bit about the bluefin tuna.\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence that the dispersed oil has -- as this point, is there any evidence that it has damaged the food chain in any ways that could ripple up or affect endangered creatures?\xc2\xa0 I understand why you would sort of -- expect sort of to get bad news to some degree on those fronts, but is there yet any evidence that you can talk about?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 The impact on the Gulf will take time to understand and to evaluate with confidence.\xc2\xa0 We are actively doing research and monitoring the impact, but it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to talk about any systemic, overall impacts at this point because there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been enough time to do justice to that very important topic.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, you said today is a consequential day, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99re wondering when is the end date?\xc2\xa0 When is the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the timeframe for today for the bottom kill, for finishing the relief well?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you two answers based on when we make the decision on the cementing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So right now -- I guess that answers my question.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know when --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, it depends on the status of the well.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to drill into the annulus, and we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to put mud and cement in and basically kill the annulus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>After that cement dries, then we have the option to drill back in and go into the pipe and do the same thing there.\xc2\xa0 It depends on the results of the static kill and the cementing decision for the static kill.\xc2\xa0 If you have to do everything, the analogy I\xe2\x80\x99ve used is taking tree rings, hollow tree rings, and filling one up and making a smaller tree and then going into the next tree.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that twice -- once is the annulus, the other one is the pipe itself.</p>\n<p>And how much we have to do at the bottom depends on the effectiveness of the static kill and the decision on the cementing.\xc2\xa0 If we have to do it twice, it will be about probably anywhere from five to seven days for the first one, and maybe five to seven days after that for the second one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, worst-case scenario, two weeks from today?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Towards the end of August, yes.\xc2\xa0 If we have to do both, yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To anyone there, I guess.\xc2\xa0 We heard so much of the doomsday scenario in the beginning of this, the blackened beaches and oil coming up the East Coast, as Chip indicated, and fishermen and shrimpers being out of business forever, having to leave the area.\xc2\xa0 Is part of the message today that the long-term impact of the spill is really not as bad as we had anticipated?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think as Dr. Lubchenco said, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- we have to evaluate what all of this means.\xc2\xa0 I think it is fairly safe to say that because of the environmental effects of Mother Nature, the warm waters of the Gulf and the federal response, that many of the doomsday scenarios that were talked about and repeated a lot have not and will not come to fruition because of that.\xc2\xa0 I think that is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good news.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is very good news.\xc2\xa0 And I think as Admiral Allen said, there were -- there have been many points along this that are important.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, as he said, we have not had an active amount of hydrocarbon being emitted into the Gulf since the sealing cap went on the 15th of July.\xc2\xa0 So there are many points along this that I think we can point to as being important days.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the static kill is a step in the ultimate killing of the well.\xc2\xa0 But, again, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll focus -- our focus will be off of containment and capture and more directly on damage and restoration.</p>\n<p>Ken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we appear to have moved into a new phase here, I was wondering if I can maybe ask a question moving forward about an assessment of the equipment that the Coast Guard and NOAA has at this point.\xc2\xa0 Have you folks found any evidence or need to perhaps go back and review whether you have the proper equipment to assist in these kind of operations?</p>\n<p>And to give it a little context, the reason I ask the question is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve depended on BP for the visuals, also the robotics beneath the surface, and I was wondering if you find that system to have -- if that is the proper way to go?\xc2\xa0 Or if the United States is to reconsider whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re properly armed to deal with these sort of emergencies?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re asking a really good question.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I would say in the five years following the Exxon Valdez to about the mid-1990s, we had a pretty robust R&amp;amp;D program, looking at oil spill response technologies.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s when we actually developed the protocols for in-situ burning and use of dispersants.</p>\n<p>I was a field commander at the time that had to negotiate those protocols with the local stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 The further we got away from that event, the investment in R&amp;amp;D kind of tapered off.\xc2\xa0 We had technology move into deepwater drilling.\xc2\xa0 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was directed at tanker-based oil traffic.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time for an assessment.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a lot of technologies that were proposed that because of the capping we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to test.\xc2\xa0 I think there needs to be a very vigorous interagency process looking at R&amp;amp;D issues and at the effectiveness of these tools moving forward.\xc2\xa0 I think some of this may come out of the commission.</p>\n<p>But I think everything indicates a re-baselining of our tools, what should be in the government inventory, what shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xc2\xa0 This is the time to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, Ken, I would just say that that is precisely why the President stood up the commission.\xc2\xa0 In the very beginning of this, I got asked I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the military just have something?\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have some submarine with giant mechanical arms that can sustain pressure at 5,000 feet and somehow screw the bottle cap on top of the blowout preventer?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s with the secret rocket, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, Captain Nemo was unavoidably detained.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that is what we have to evaluate.\xc2\xa0 And I think the question also -- when you get a permit to drill, and this is what I talked about in terms of the deepwater drilling, the President wants to be assured that there is a containment structure and a plan in place that matches directly what is being undertaken -- the size, the scope of the well, the depth at which it\xe2\x80\x99s being done at and what equipment needs to be on hand either from our perspective or from the perspective of a company that\xe2\x80\x99s making those.</p>\n<p>Did you have another one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You covered it actually in that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of the berm project that Governor Jindal advocated?\xc2\xa0 And is there any need for that now?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer that question to Governor Jindal.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss just a little bit the emotional response to this news within the administration?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President -- that was the first time that he was delighted to hear from Ms. Browner.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was somewhat joking.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I assume. But this has cast a pall over the administration for weeks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s dominated the news cycles at times I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you would have rather talked about other things like the economy.\xc2\xa0 Was there a collective sigh of relief?\xc2\xa0 How was this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we have -- many of us up here have been working on this for now a hundred and some-odd days.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody gets real high or real low because we have on any number of occasions met timelines that weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get met as they originally were.\xc2\xa0 And I would reiterate that I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- today is not an end.\xc2\xa0 Today is not -- today does not mark somehow the dissolution of the energy and the effort in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is a point along a journey toward -- that will ultimately end in restoring the Gulf to a place that, as the President said, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way the Gulf was the day before this happened.\xc2\xa0 But we have all talked about what happened to the Gulf and to the natural barrier islands as a result of hurricanes that have happened over the years and getting the Gulf back to -- and restore the Gulf back to the health that it was before that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there at least a feeling that the oil clouds are parting?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that the static kill having worked is good news. The evaluation that will now happen about the bottom kill, the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on the relief well, the sealing cap that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place since the 15th of July and the notion that we have a fairly accurate and scientific accounting of where the oil is represents a good day among those hundred or so that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with this.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a White House strategy going forward on natural resource damage assessments?\xc2\xa0 Will those be done yearly?\xc2\xa0 And will BP be billed for those?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the first comment and maybe Carol would like to comment.</p>\n<p>The natural resource damage assessment is required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\xc2\xa0 It involves the federal trustees -- and that would be the Department of Commerce and NOAA, Fish and Wildlife, Interior, Tribal Resources and so forth.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And states.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 And states.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s actually a government structure that\xe2\x80\x99s associated with that with a lead federal trustee kind of a coordinator that kind of replaces the federal on-scene coordinator for the response model, if you will, to take a look at how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do the assessment and move forward.\xc2\xa0 And the steering committee for that group has already met a couple of times in the process of being stood up.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and the First Family are due to vacation down in the Gulf next weekend. Has anything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the past 24 hours changed their plans?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to have any sort of public event or opportunity to get a firsthand assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the schedule in front of me.\xc2\xa0 There will be a public component to that. We discussed -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that over the past several days.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get more information to you as we get closer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any chance of him going sooner?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Overall, what has the administration learned from this whole incident?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How much time do you have?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Want to take a crack?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Actually, it relates to the earlier question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give you one facet of it.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at the oil production infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico as it relates to response, back when the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed, it was basically tanker-focused.\xc2\xa0 Somewhere between 1984 and 1985, the drilling began to move offshore.</p>\n<p>There were a couple of significant breakthroughs that were happening at the time we were focused on tankers. One of them was we weren\xe2\x80\x99t restricted to fixed rigs any more; we had floating rigs.\xc2\xa0 And the production machinery and a lot of the stuff associated with the drilling systems went to the bottom, including blowout preventers.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the controls that control everything down there and the hydraulics benefitted from multiplexing and being able to send electronic signals down the hydraulics rather than trying to press that stuff down a mile.\xc2\xa0 That allowed them to move further offshore, where our regulatory environment for response planning was focused on tanker-driven incidents, although we knew it was going on.</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to bring into the Gulf to effectuate the control of this well is a combination of technologies that are used in the Northern Sea and off of Angola, where they used vertically riser -- that are suspended under the water.\xc2\xa0 None of that preexisted in the Gulf of Mexico because all the oil is transported by pipelines back to where it is embarked, so we actually had to put together -- I say we collectively, led mostly by the private sector -- pieces of oil containment and production structures that are used in different parts of the world and bring them for the first time ever into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>When the Helix Producer started producing, that was the first time a floating production platform had ever operated in the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I just want to add one thing -- I mean, as Robert said, how much time do you have?\xc2\xa0 But one of the things that I have found very interesting in this process is our ability to reach out and really engage the entire federal government.\xc2\xa0 This has been a very, very large undertaking.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so there\xe2\x80\x99s the obvious parties that participate -- the Coast Guard who has the expertise in terms of oil spill; NOAA, obviously; EPA.\xc2\xa0 But also we brought in Dr. Chu.\xc2\xa0 We brought in the National Science Labs.\xc2\xa0 And this really became a government-wide effort at every turn to sort through what was the best way to take the next step, to get this contained, to get it closed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And now we\xe2\x80\x99ll be engaging even more agencies as we move into the next phase, which is the cleanup and then the restoration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you -- at this point, you say that the 8 percent represents the chemically dispersed aspect of the oil.\xc2\xa0 Then how important was this decision on May 15th to do this unprecedented move where you actually took the oil from the surface and decided that you would disperse it on the floor of the ocean, first time ever that\xe2\x80\x99s been done?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Correct. Actually, that was done after there was consultation with industry.\xc2\xa0 And I think ExxonMobil might have been the ones that actually recommended it to BP.\xc2\xa0 It had been tried someplace else in the world, and forgive me if I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact location.\xc2\xa0 They said this is something that may be applicable, but it had never been done at this depth.</p>\n<p>The reason that was important to the overall dispersant strategy is that for dispersants to work, you have to have some agitation to be able to make it actually interact with the oil and disperse.\xc2\xa0 If you just deliver it through an aerial platform to oil that\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on the surface, it has an effect, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not as effective unless you can get it agitated.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Applying a very small amount of dispersant into the column as it rises up that 5,000 feet and the energy and the agitation that takes place greatly facilitates the dispersion, and then greatly facilitates the biodegradation that happens to the oil.\xc2\xa0 So the decision to do that was one of the steps that allowed us to say we can significantly reduce the amount of dispersants -- right amount, right place, right time -- using the energy generated by the oil itself rising.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It had never been tried before; it was a gutsy move to do.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it was the right decision?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, in retrospect, it is one of the conditions that allowed us to sit down with Lisa Jackson, I think around the 25th of May, and said, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reduce dispersants by 75 percent, and we got to 72 before the capping stack went on.\xc2\xa0 But one of the reasons we were able to do that is we were more able to effectively apply the dispersants we needed to apply at the point where they\xe2\x80\x99d have the most effect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the food chain question.\xc2\xa0 Some researchers at Tulane University have found an oil and dispersant mix under the shells of blue crab larvae all over the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that the dispersed oil is actually so small that it has a greater chance of entering the food chain?</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 Oil that is dispersed is in smaller droplets and it would be -- smaller droplets affect smaller creatures; bigger chunks affect bigger creatures.\xc2\xa0 So I think the dispersed oil -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out how to answer this simply -- oil that is dispersed is more likely to be encountered by and affect the smaller life in the oceans, I think is the simplest way to put it.\xc2\xa0 And this is true --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But bigger animals eat these crab larvae, though.</p>\n<p>DR. LUBCHENCO:\xc2\xa0 So what I said was true whether the dispersed oil was dispersed naturally or dispersed chemically.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter how it got to be microscopic droplets.\xc2\xa0 And so there is likely to be some dispersed oil that affects various creatures in the ocean, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the long-term studies that we need to do to see what impact that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have on those food webs.</p>\n<p>Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, for example, that a fish is eating some of those smaller creatures that had oil in them.\xc2\xa0 That fish will degrade that oil and process it naturally.\xc2\xa0 And so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bio-accumulate, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a situation where we need to be concerned about that.\xc2\xa0 Over time, it will be broken down.\xc2\xa0 The question is, what is the impact in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Probably for the Admiral.\xc2\xa0 Of the 27,000 rigs that are now in the Gulf, how many are active and how many do you feel secure about in terms of their integrity, sir?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Actually I\xe2\x80\x99m going to probably throw that to Carol.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I think -- it changes.\xc2\xa0 It changes as things move around.\xc2\xa0 So we can get you --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been an effort by the Department of Interior to get a really good handle on those -- the unintended ones, potentially abandoned.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something I\xe2\x80\x99m doing as part of the response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we get that information from you at some point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get it to you.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you mentioned several bills were going to be sent to BP.\xc2\xa0 Do you know the timeline for each of those bills?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, many -- I think we put on the top of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s transcript, I think more than $200 million --</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Four bills.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- and four bills have gone already.\xc2\xa0 Again, the penalty phase for oil emission is -- will come, as will the damage assessments that we talked about the other day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned one of them was going to be on environmental degradation.\xc2\xa0 With the uncertainty of knowing either a year from now or 10 years from now, 20 years from now, what that degradation is going to be, how is that amount going to be calculated?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 So there will be under -- as the Admiral pointed out, under the Oil Pollution Act, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole process for working through natural resource damage assessment. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement that is reached and the money is paid by BP to the trustees, which include the states, the federal agencies and any tribes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You had another one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just comment on -- is there any concern about the appearances of -- is there any concern inside the White House about the appearances of the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s trip overseas and any thought of having her vacation here in the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the First Lady is on a private trip.\xc2\xa0 She is a private citizen and is the mother of a daughter on a private trip.\xc2\xa0 And I think I\xe2\x80\x99d leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about -- a little bit about the White House reaction to the vote in Missouri last night against a federal mandate for insurance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A vote of no legal significance in the midst of heavy Republican primaries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, what does it tell you, though, in terms of what --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President of Mexico has -- oh, sorry.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, go ahead -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President of Mexico has just said that he is going to be open to hear proposals to legalize drug consumption in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 And some people in the federal government are saying because the Merida Initiative is not working, he is looking for other option.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen those statements.\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from NSC and we\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is the position of the President in terms of legalize the use of drugs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not been for drug legalization.</p>\n<p>Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as this BP accident is concerned, what message do you have for America as far as any impact on the gas stations\xe2\x80\x99 prices are concerned -- short term, long term, or international market?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This was an exploratory well and not a production well.\xc2\xa0 In other words, this was not -- what happens is these wells are drilled and cemented and then they come back at some point for production.\xc2\xa0 So this is not oil that is taken out of the larger scheme of the oil economy, as it was an exploratory well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Bradley Manning?\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us about Bradley Manning --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the state aid bill --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the state aid bill that the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss active investigations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Collins and Snowe of Maine voted for the state aid bill today and overcame the filibuster because they said it was an emergency, and they\xe2\x80\x99re now saying since it\xe2\x80\x99s an emergency the House needs to come back and pass this thing.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House trying to get the House to come back to pass this?\xc2\xa0 Do you consider it an emergency that needs to be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think today\xe2\x80\x99s vote represents -- well, today\xe2\x80\x99s vote is an important development as we head back into the school year and tens of thousands, probably more than 160,000 teachers, as a result of this economy, were likely facing pink slips.\xc2\xa0 And we know what that means for -- any of us who have children in school, we understand what that means.\xc2\xa0 When you take that number of teachers out of the classroom, you increase the teacher-to-student ratios; it affects our long-term ability to educate our children and to compete in this economy.</p>\n<p>Senator Collins and Senator Snowe stood up and bravely joined 59 others in ensuring that we would take some of those important steps.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on the House.\xc2\xa0 I know that this is something that -- this was of great importance to the House and it is our hope that we can get something, having moved beyond this filibuster, to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk that can prevent those tens of thousands of teachers from being laid off.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you think the President would like to see it this week, which would require the House --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President would like to see it as quickly as he can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could on Iran, which said it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten 300 antiaircraft missiles from Belarus after we convinced the Russians not to sell --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Belarus, I believe, has denied that, and I would point you to that report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do one more and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell and the President are meeting this afternoon, I guess on judicial nominations or nominations in general?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President and Senator McConnell are extending their -- the bipartisan meeting that happened here a week or so ago in which the President was and continues to be frustrated by the pace at which the Senate deals with nominations for judgeships and nominations for service in this government.</p>\n<p>Right now there are 12 federal judicial nominees that have passed the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous vote.\xc2\xa0 There are other judges that have been through the process and approved by the Judiciary Committee.\xc2\xa0 There will be a direct discussion about moving those judges -- we heard a lot in the previous eight years about the importance of federal judges.\xc2\xa0 I doubt they have gotten less important in the previous 18 months.</p>\n<p>We have documented and talked about extensively in this room the downright delay and utter obstruction in getting nominees confirmed to important positions in this government.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President was rightly frustrated, and has been, at a pace in the Senate that is unrivaled and unmatched in its slowness.\xc2\xa0 That will be the topic of discussion, and it is our hope that the Senate in the time remaining before August will move quickly on many of those judgeships, the ones that have passed unanimously and others, as well as the appointees that have been waiting for months to be approved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And prospects for recess appointments this weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me know how that meeting goes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this their first one-on-one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think so, yes.</p>\n<p>END</p>\n<p>2:50 P.M. EDT \xc2\xa0</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
