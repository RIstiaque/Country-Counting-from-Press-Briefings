EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 How are you?\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the first leg of the President\'s three-day trip following his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, I believe, President Obama will visit Conveyor Engineering and Manufacturing in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to discuss the American manufacturing pillar he laid out in last night\'s State of the Union address.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConveyor Engineering and Manufacturing specializes in handcrafted custom machinery for large-scale processing of raw agricultural products used in the ethanol, food service, and related industries.\xc2\xa0 The family-owned business employs approximately 65 workers, and began as a small shop in 1977.\xc2\xa0 Three years ago, Conveyor moved into a new custom-built facility that more than doubled the size of its manufacturing space.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnder the new manufacturing policies the President proposed in the State of the Union, Conveyor would receive an increased manufacturing tax credit.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the company, the President will tour the factory floor and deliver remarks to an audience of several hundred, including employees and invited guests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDuring the three-stop tour, led by President Graig Cone, and operations manager Jeff Baxter, the President will see custom machinery that will be shipped to clients across the country.\xc2\xa0 Prior to his remarks, the President will be introduced by Mr. Baxter, the operations manager.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can also give you a little readout on the next stop, if that would be helpful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will visit Intel\'s Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona, to deliver remarks on American manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 The Ocotillo campus is the site of a new chip manufacturing facility called Fab 42, whose groundbreaking Intel announced when President Obama visited the company\'s Oregon facility last February.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIntel is making a $5 billion investment to build the new Fab 42 facility, bringing thousands of construction and permanent manufacturing jobs to Arizona.\xc2\xa0 When completed in 2013, Fab 42 will be the most advanced high-volume semiconductor manufacturing plant in the world.\xc2\xa0 Intel would benefit from a number of the policies President Obama laid out in the State of the Union address, including tax breaks for high-tech manufacturers and companies that choose to stay or bring jobs back to America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will deliver remarks to an audience of several thousand people including Intel employees and guests in front of the Fab 42 construction site.\xc2\xa0 He will be introduced by Preston McDaniel, the senior program manager responsible for all aspects of Intel\'s Fab 42 factory construction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is my readout of the upcoming events, at the beginning of this fantastic trip.\xc2\xa0 Questions, please.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about the Somali pirate operation and what led the President to make those remarks to Leon Panetta last night?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is true that the President, when he saw the Secretary of Defense, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was congratulating them on a successful mission because he had been informed at, I believe, 6:43 p.m. of the success of the mission to rescue the American hostage as well as the Danish hostage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat led to it was the President was apprised of the fact that Jessica Buchanan had been taken hostage back on, I believe it was October 25th -- he was apprised of it the next day, of the kidnapping, and was updated on it regularly.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the Department of Defense has more details on this, but the decision to go ahead with this rescue mission was made because there was information concerning the deteriorating health of Ms. Buchanan, as well as a window of opportunity to try to execute this mission.\xc2\xa0 The President made the decision about 9:00 p.m. on -- let me make sure I get this right -- 9:00 p.m. on Monday night -- that\'s right -- when his counterterrorism advisor, John Brennan, briefed the President in the residence at approximately 9:00 p.m. on Monday night.\xc2\xa0 And the President authorized the operation to proceed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThroughout the day yesterday, the President received updates from Mr. Brennan and was told at 6:43 p.m. that Ms. Buchanan and Mr. Thisted were safe and in U.S. hands.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President speak to the SEAL team or the SEAL team commander today expressing his --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no calls to report.\xc2\xa0 He did call -- upon return from finishing the State of the Union address, he called Ms. Buchanan\'s father at 10:32 p.m. -- John Buchanan -- and informed him of the successful mission.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any concurrent Situation Room monitoring of this whole thing, like the situation that went on during the bin Laden operation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Defense for that kind of information.\xc2\xa0 The mission was, as you would expect, monitored very closely throughout --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, in the White House Situation Room --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just said that John Brennan was briefing the President regularly in his offices in the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel today about how the State of the Union went last night, the reaction to it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He feels very positive.\xc2\xa0 He feels -- he felt good about the speech.\xc2\xa0 He felt very satisfied with the way the speech came together and the message about laying out a Blueprint for an America Built to Last was both -- was well received both in the hall and outside, across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he understands that while many millions of Americans watched the speech last night, that part of his responsibility as President to try to move this agenda forward is to get out and talk about it around the country, which is why he\'s embarked on this trip today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President has been talking about "we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait," but yesterday he talked a lot about initiatives that would require congressional action, some of which have failed in the past -- oil subsidies -- cutting oil subsidies, fee on big banks, those sorts of things.\xc2\xa0 What kind of expectation does he honestly have that these things will happen, or are they merely kind of leverage points in order to get other things from them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make two points, Jim -- I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, the President is using every tool in his toolbox to try to advance his economic and jobs agenda.\xc2\xa0 That includes working with Congress on things that require legislative action, but it also includes doing everything he can through executive action.\xc2\xa0 And that was reflected in the State of the Union address last night.\xc2\xa0 That has always been the case, and again, it was reflected last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s not na\xc3\xafve about the kind of resistance that he\xe2\x80\x99s faced from Republican members of Congress and the obstructionist approach that many Republicans have taken to what is by any clear-eyed definition a very common-sense, centrist agenda.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s also optimistic that there will be opportunities this year to move important pieces of business through Congress, not because suddenly Republicans will relent out of charity or goodwill, but because they will be under pressure from their constituents to show that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing something constructive to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, every single member of the House of Representatives who\xe2\x80\x99s not retiring is up for reelection this fall, not just the President.\xc2\xa0 A third of the Senate is up for reelection.\xc2\xa0 And each of those elected representatives will have to explain to his or her constituents what they did in this Congress that helped the United States of America, helped the economy, helped create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And if the answer is, I just opposed everything that President Obama put forward because President Obama put it forward, even though a lot of his ideas reflected input from Republicans or had their genesis in bipartisan proposals of the past, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a hard message to sell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that on a broad array of issues, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s helping ensure that Americans -- that every American can refinance, every responsible homeowner can refinance his or her home mortgage loan, or extending the payroll tax cut, or taking the action that the President will talk about today to enhance American manufacturing, make changes that are deficit-neutral to enhance American manufacturing -- is it really the position -- would it be the position of any member of Congress that they\'re against building the American manufacturing sector in this country, increasing the number of jobs that are available to Americans from that sector of the economy?\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear the argument for that one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Buffett Rule, how did the President ultimately settle on 30 percent?\xc2\xa0 And what have you guys thought about to put in place to prevent it from hitting small businesses?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a schedule of how broad individual tax reform would break down and what impact it would have on capital gains or dividends or -- the principle the President laid out would guide, he believes very strongly should guide, tax reform.\xc2\xa0 The 30 percent makes a lot of sense and it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising because Warren Buffett, on this issue, himself has made a lot of sense, and it was the figure I believe Mr. Buffett also put forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, it\xe2\x80\x99s a principle, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of data to back it up, that there are a lot of very fortunate Americans, millionaires and billionaires, who pay taxes at a substantially lower rate than many, many millions of Americans of more modest means.\xc2\xa0 The President simply believes that as a matter of principle, that unfairness ought to be changed.\xc2\xa0 And not because it\xe2\x80\x99s class warfare, but because we have important priorities that need to be addressed in this country -- our national security, our investments in education and infrastructure, our commitments to our seniors -- and we are in a situation where we have to be very mindful of our fiscal health.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo those are choices that have to be made, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t insist that the tax code be fairer, that everyone does their fair share, then somebody else has to get stuck with the bill:\xc2\xa0 seniors, middle-class Americans, kids with disabilities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a choice that -- or you just load up on the deficit and the debt.\xc2\xa0 And the President is opposed to that. We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of a lot of tax plans lately that, among other things, would do the reverse of the Buffett Rule.\xc2\xa0 They would lower taxes for millionaires and billionaires who are paying at a much lower rate than a lot of Americans with moderate incomes or eliminate them entirely.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the right approach.\xc2\xa0 And in addition to doing that -- or as a result of doing that, they would further add to our deficit and debt.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, he had a fairly pointed tone against the lack of bipartisanship in Washington yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see that tone continue in these next five stops?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you be the judge of that as we move through these three days.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly that outside of the Beltway, the nation is not nearly as divided as it is in Washington, and that the partisanship for partisanship\xe2\x80\x99s sake is excessive and frustrating for most Americans.\xc2\xa0 They just want to see Washington work on the problems that they face every day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think, broadly speaking, the tone that the President adopted last night will be reflected going forward, but it was also a very positive and optimistic tone.\xc2\xa0 He is -- he rejects the idea that there are challenges out there that we can\'t solve. He rejects the idea that America is somehow in decline.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he feels just the opposite.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the remarkable progress that has been made in the last couple of years since the worst recession since the Great Depression only reinforces his opinion that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to emerge stronger and better and with an economy that\'s built to last, as opposed to one that\'s built on ephemeral bubbles like the housing bubble or the Internet bubble or the financial sector bubble.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President had some stern words for China last night on its trade practices.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear more of that on this trip as he visits factories?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, today he\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on what I described before about his -- the manufacturing pillar.\xc2\xa0 Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s an element here to that that has to do with enforcement on trade, as he talked about last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen the President discussed this during his Asia trip, that everybody has got to play by the same set of rules, and that\'s important because he knows that when American manufacturers are put on a level playing field, they\'re the best there are, and they can compete.\xc2\xa0 So obviously that\'s an important part of his agenda.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to quantify how much that will be a focal point in today\xe2\x80\x99s events, for example, but it is an important aspect of what he discussed last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would that proposal on education work, Jay, where the President said that schools -- colleges or universities that raise tuition would see a decrease in federal funding?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does that need legislative approval?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will be discussing that specific proposal on Friday at Ann Arbor, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let him give you more details.\xc2\xa0 But the general principle is that if universities and colleges are not doing a good job of keeping costs down, or costs keep going up, then their support from the federal government will go down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe believes that\'s very important because American -- higher education cannot become an unaffordable luxury for regular Americans because if it does, the impact on our long-term economic prospects will be very negative.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to making sure that higher education -- quality higher education remains accessible to Americans of all economic backgrounds.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But where would the teeth be?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how would you enact --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would let -- I would ask you to wait for the President to provide more details, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide more details on Friday.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s focus is manufacturing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he specify the manufacturing rate that he wants to see?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he will specify -- he will give specifics today, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide you more details today about actions that Congress could take right away in a deficit-neutral way to enhance American manufacturing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he talk to you about seeing Gabby Giffords on the floor yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He just said it was wonderful to see her -- briefly when we were on the plane earlier talking about it.\xc2\xa0 And you could tell I thought, personally, when you watched it.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s all he said -- it was wonderful to see her.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to the 30 percent tax rate.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s recently disclosed taxes and the effective rate of 14-15 percent that he pays provides a foundation for making the argument?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s approach on this issue long predates recent developments in the other party\xe2\x80\x99s primary campaign.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about the Buffett Rule for a number of months now.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are not focused on any individual.\xc2\xa0 They\'re focused on a general principle that millionaires and billionaires, folks who have had the good fortune of succeeding, thanks to all that this country has to offer, need to do their fair share; that they should not be paying taxes at a lower rate because of loopholes or irregularities in the tax system than average Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know events propel ideas, so is this an event that propels your idea?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the idea well predates the event that you\xe2\x80\x99re describing, and again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not targeted towards an individual.\xc2\xa0 If this is a purely sort of campaign question about the President versus a potential Republican nominee, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Chicago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEverybody good?\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 Anything else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are you doing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m great.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tired, but pretty pumped up.\xc2\xa0 It was a great night last night, for a variety of reasons, the speech and the mission.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t11:44 A.M.
