CEST</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLER MERKEL:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bid a very warm welcome to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, here to Germany on this fifth visit, this time to Hannover.\xc2\xa0 And let me tell you that I am delighted to have an opportunity not only to continue our talks, but today is going to be very remarkable day, because we\'re going to open the Hannover fair together.\xc2\xa0 And the United States of America, this year, will be the partner country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are turbulent times.\xc2\xa0 I think we would both agree.\xc2\xa0 And we have an opportunity talk about the whole spectrum of international issues.\xc2\xa0 Our bilateral relations are excellent.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t need to spend too much time on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me tell you, Barack, that I very much value our candid, open talks that are always based on mutual trust.\xc2\xa0 We talk about the whole range of issues and we do so today, as we have done many times previously, and I hope and trust that we shall continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe used this opportunity here to talk about, as I said, the broad spectrum of international issues, for example, combatting terrorism, tackling the root causes of flight, and also the peace process, but also questions related to migration in general.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn many ways, the European Union is a target for those -- or a destination, rather -- for those refugees that do not enjoy peace and freedom at home.\xc2\xa0 So Syria loomed large on our agenda. We, together, support the political process that has to be brought forward.\xc2\xa0 We support the Geneva talks.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m greatly concerned that the cease-fire did not hold and hasn\'t held these past few days and that there are outbreaks of fights in Aleppo and other places.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was able to see yesterday along the border with Syria and Turkey what this means by way of suffering, of the stress of people when there is fighting in their home area.\xc2\xa0 So we want to do everything in order to bring the Geneva talks to a successful outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also talked about Libya, because here it is going to be very important to support the unity government there, even though, obviously, it\'s a very fragile one.\xc2\xa0 This, too, is an entanglement of, on the one hand, the stability and the problems that this new unity government has to stabilize the situation, but also when we look at Syria, for example, there are enormous migratory flows across the Aegean Sea that are triggered by the\xc2\xa0 developments there.</p>\n<p>\n\tI am very grateful that the United States of America is supporting the NATO mission in the Aegean.\xc2\xa0 They are going to continue to do so, I understand.\xc2\xa0 And this in many ways is also a joint European-American effort, a transatlantic mission, and we were at one in saying that all of the security issues on the very doorstep of Europe actually can only be solved, can only be tackled by joint transatlantic efforts.\xc2\xa0 And only in this way can our common security be ensured.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this also means -- and here we were also in agreement -- that a European agreement is necessary, a German agreement is necessary in many of these issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think Germany over the past few months has demonstrated that we are willing to make this additional effort to go the extra mile, be it in Iraq fighting terrorism, be it in the Syrian issue, be it, for example, in the way that we have become engaged in the mission in Mali and in many other places where we are on missions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe talked about Afghanistan, and Afghanistan, too, needs to be kept on a track which is promising for the Afghani people.\xc2\xa0 We are ready and willing to be militarily engaged, to continue to be militarily engaged.\xc2\xa0 We\'re grateful to the United States of America for the very great responsibility that you are willing to continue to shoulder.\xc2\xa0 And I think the message to the Taliban needs to be the international community will not leave Afghanistan in this current predicament.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe then, last but not least, also talked about an issue where we are also interested in and where the United States also participates in the Normandy format, namely the solution of the crisis in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We stand by the Minsk agreement.\xc2\xa0 We attach the greatest possible importance to the Minsk agreement being implemented as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 We will put a lot of effort into making this possible in our talks with Ukraine, but also in our talks with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we still don\'t have a stable cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 We need to bring the political process forward.\xc2\xa0 And the next few steps we\'ve also discussed very thoroughly.</p>\n<p>\n\tTonight, economic issues will loom large on the agenda, which is why I don\'t want to go into the issue of the free trade agreement right now.\xc2\xa0 We will have an opportunity to do so later on.\xc2\xa0 But from a European perspective, let me say this very clearly.\xc2\xa0 It is very helpful in order to allow our economy in Europe to grow.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important for the German economy; it\'s important for the whole of the European economy.\xc2\xa0 And if I look at the progress that was made with Transatlantic -- the TPP -- the TransPacific agreement, I think we all ought to have an interest in speeding matters up.\xc2\xa0 And I hope and trust that the American President will continue to support these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 We should do our bit in order to make this a success.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much, again, for this visit.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m very much looking forward to, well, the other things that are sort of lining up for us today and tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And I\'d like to welcome you on behalf of the German citizens and on behalf of the citizens of Hannover.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Thank you to Chancellor Merkel for your welcome.\xc2\xa0 It is wonderful to be back in Germany.\xc2\xa0 I believe I\'m the first U.S. President to visit and spend time here in Hannover, and the magnificent surroundings reflect the history and beauty of this city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is always a great pleasure to be back with my friend and partner, Angela.\xc2\xa0 I have valued Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s thinking and perspective on a whole range of global issues throughout my presidency.\xc2\xa0 You have been a trusted partner throughout my entire presidency -- longer than any world leader -- and I value your judgment.\xc2\xa0 I thank you for your commitment to our alliance and to the values and human rights for which we stand.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m grateful for our personal friendship.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m here, at Angela\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, for the Hannover Messe Trade Show.\xc2\xa0 Angela and I will join the opening ceremonies this evening and visit some exhibitions tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder that the United States and Germany are each other\xe2\x80\x99s -- among each other\xe2\x80\x99s largest trading partners.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a relationship we have to keep building and nurturing so that we\'re creating more jobs and more prosperity for our people, and keeping our countries competitive in the global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn that regard, Angela and I agree that the United States and the European Union need to keep moving forward with the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations, which we\'ll discuss more this evening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn our bilateral meeting, we discussed the importance of boosting economic growth in the Eurozone, which is critical to the global economy, including the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 Strong growth in Europe is particularly important given the array of pressing challenges -- whether its security, defense, migration, or refugees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI should add, by the way, that given the urgency of climate change -- and the economic opportunities in clean energy -- both of our nations have signed the Paris climate change agreement, and we agree that it needs to be implemented quickly.\xc2\xa0 And we also agree the world has to make concrete progress this year to phase down dangerous hydrofluorocarbons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, most of our discussion, as Chancellor Merkel indicated, focused on urgent security challenges.\xc2\xa0 Germany is a vital member of the coalition to destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 German aircraft support the air campaign, and German personnel in Iraq are training local forces.\xc2\xa0 German assistance is helping Iraq stabilize and rebuild the areas it liberates from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And our coalition continues to make progress.\xc2\xa0 Today we discussed additional steps that NATO could take to support the campaign, as well as economic assistance to Iraq that the G7 could pledge at next month\xe2\x80\x99s summit in Japan.</p>\n<p>\n\tGermany is obviously a strong partner in international efforts to provide humanitarian relief to the people of Syria and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We remain deeply concerned about the upsurge in fighting in Syria over the last several days, and we continue to agree that the only real, durable solution is a political solution that moves Syria toward an inclusive government that represents all Syrians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven the horrific attacks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen around the world -- including Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, San Bernardino in California, and on a much more frequent basis, attacks and horrific violence that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in the Middle East -- we discussed the importance of maintaining our strong security cooperation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Afghanistan, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to help strengthen Afghan forces as they push back against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and ISIL. We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to support the Libyan people and the new Libyan government as it seeks to expand security across its country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe agreed that the United States and Germany are going to remain very strong counterterrorism and intelligence partners, and we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to using all the tools at our disposal to prevent terrorists from traveling and plotting attacks.\xc2\xa0 And that includes improved information-sharing between our countries and within Europe.\xc2\xa0 And, as always, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do so while upholding our values and civil liberties, including the privacy of citizens here and in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to once again commend Angela for her courageous leadership as Germany and Europe respond to migrants who are desperately fleeing the Syrian conflict and conflicts elsewhere in the region.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps because she once lived behind a wall herself, Angela understands the aspirations of those who\xe2\x80\x99ve been denied their freedom and who seek a better life.\xc2\xa0 And I know the politics around this issue can be difficult in all of our countries.\xc2\xa0 We did discuss the EU\xe2\x80\x99s recent agreement with Turkey, and Angela and I agree that our nations can respond to this challenge in a way that is both humane and ensures our security.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, as we look ahead to this summer\xe2\x80\x99s NATO summit in Warsaw, we discussed the importance of keeping the Alliance strong with the investments needed for our collective defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continue to augment, on a rotational basis, NATO forces in Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states.\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve said from the very beginning of my presidency, we have a treaty obligation to defend every NATO ally -- and we will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond the Alliance, we welcome the formation of a new government in Ukraine, which we encourage to continue the political, economic and energy reforms that can deliver progress for the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, have been tireless in pursuit of a peaceful and durable solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we agree that all sides need to uphold the commitments they made, and that sanctions on Russia can and should only be lifted once Russia fully complies with its commitments under the Minsk agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tTomorrow, Chancellor Merkel will host our meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, President Hollande, Prime Minister Renzi, as we discuss the full range of challenges that we face together.\xc2\xa0 And it will be another reminder of how grateful I am for Angela\xe2\x80\x99s partnership, and how much the United States values our enduring transatlantic Alliance, including with Germany.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo vielen dank, Chancellor Merkel.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The first question will come from Roberta Rampton with Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 President Obama, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made the case many times that T-TIP and the TPP with Asia are modern trade agreements that kind of deal with some of the problems or issues that arose with earlier deals.\xc2\xa0 But that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have resonated.\xc2\xa0 The deals are very unpopular at home, and there were huge protests here yesterday over the T-TIP.\xc2\xa0 And of course, it\'s a huge presidential issue -- presidential election issue.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan to realistically advance the deals?\xc2\xa0 Is it realistic to say you want to get T-TIP done by the end of the year?\xc2\xa0 And at this point, realistically, will TPP, which is at the front of the queue, of course, have to wait for congressional approval until the lame duck session at the earliest at the end of the year?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Chancellor Merkel, you said yesterday in Turkey that you favor the creation of the type of safe zone in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama has said in the past that he opposes these types of zones because, while they\xe2\x80\x99re well-intentioned, they would require a military force on the ground to protect the safety of the people.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering whether you\'re going to try to convince President Obama to rethink his position on these types of safe zones, and how you would see them working in terms of enforcing safety on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 With respect to trade, I think what you\'re seeing around the world is people are unsettled by globalization. And although trade has brought enormous benefits to many of our countries that have been engaged in trade, although, typically, jobs that are produced from exports have higher wages and better benefits than those that are not involved with the export market, people visibly see a plant moving and jobs lost, and the narrative develops that this is weakening, rather than strengthening, the position of ordinary people and ordinary workers, and it\xe2\x80\x99s forcing them to compete with low-wage labor.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, is what drives a lot of suspicion, understandably, of these trade deals.\xc2\xa0 The benefits oftentimes are diffuse, whereas a particular plant or business that feels it\xe2\x80\x99s been hurt by outside competition feels it very acutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you look at the benefits to the United States or to Germany of free trade around the world, it is indisputable that it has made our economies stronger.\xc2\xa0 It has made sure that our businesses are the most competitive in the world.\xc2\xa0 And as you see other markets like China beginning to develop, and Asia beginning to develop, and Africa growing fast, we\'ve got to make sure that our businesses can compete there.\xc2\xa0 Because, at least in the United States, 95 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s markets are outside of our borders, and if we\'re not there, present, we\'re going to have problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the relationship between Europe and the United States is already one of the most robust trading relationships in the world.\xc2\xa0 But what we\'ve discovered is, is that while strengthening labor provisions, and strengthening environmental provisions and standards, we can also eliminate a lot of regulatory and bureaucratic irritants and blockages to trade that would allow us to engage in even more trade, sell more goods, create more jobs, and create more prosperity.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, with respect to the politics of it, recent surveys in the United States, for example, showed that, actually, the majority of people still favor trade.\xc2\xa0 They still recognize, on balance, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring presidential elections, it\xe2\x80\x99s always tough.\xc2\xa0 When we\'re in the heat of campaigns, people naturally are going to worry more about what\xe2\x80\x99s lost than what\xe2\x80\x99s gained with respect to trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 But I am confident that we\'re going to be able to get this done.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind there were people who didn\'t think that with the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we would ever be able to give me the authority to actually move it forward, and we got it done.\xc2\xa0 People didn\'t think we were going to be able to negotiate with 11 countries in the Asia Pacific and have a deal that, in fact, does strengthen labor and does strengthen environmental provisions, and yet, we got it done.\xc2\xa0 And I think the same is going to be true here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t anticipate that we will be able to have completed ratification of a deal by the end of the year, but I do anticipate that we can have completed the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And then it will be presented to our various legislatures, our various parliaments.\xc2\xa0 But that that point, we will have the negotiations completed and people will be able to see exactly why this would be good for our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with respect to Congress and Trans-Pacific Partnership, I think after the primary season is over the politics settle down a little bit in Congress, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to start moving forward.\xc2\xa0 Because I know that we have had a majority of members in the past who were in favor of this deal.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten the authority for me to go ahead and fast-track this agreement.\xc2\xa0 But I think we all know that elections can sometimes make things a little more challenging, and people take positions, in part, to protect themselves from attacks during the course of election season.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing I do want to say with respect to Syria -- we all care deeply about the tragic humanitarian crisis inside of Syrian.\xc2\xa0 I live with this every day.\xc2\xa0 I read about it every day. We talk to people who are experiencing suffering or witness the suffering that\'s going on there.\xc2\xa0 We are in constant communications with Turkey, our NATO ally, in finding ways in which we can resolve this situation.\xc2\xa0 As you know, I spoke to President Putin early last week to try to make sure that we could reinstate the cessation of hostilities and make sure that the political process does not unwind.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut having said all that, the issue surrounding a safe zone in Syrian territory is not a matter of an ideological objection on my part.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of me not wishing I could help and protect a whole bunch of people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very practical issue about how do you do it?\xc2\xa0 And who is going to put on a bunch of ground troops inside of Syria?\xc2\xa0 And how do you let people in?\xc2\xa0 And who do you let in and who do you let out?\xc2\xa0 And how is it monitored?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the truth of the matter is, is that when I go through with my Defense Department -- and we\'ve done it multiple times -- how a proposal like that might work, as a practical matter, sadly, it is very difficult to see how it would operate short of us essentially being willing to militarily take over a big chunk of that country.\xc2\xa0 And that requires a big military commitment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that one of the biggest challenges that Angela and I both face is, is that we oftentimes see great wrongs taking place around the world and we do everything that we can to try to right them, but one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned as President is we have to make sure that whatever it is that we say we\'re going to do we can deliver.\xc2\xa0 And creating a situation in which we could\xc2\xa0 actually protect all the people inside of Syria, the best bet for doing that is to get this political process on track, a transition on track, so that all the parties can safely lay down their arms and create the kind of inclusive, representational government that Syria so desperately needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLOR MERKEL:\xc2\xa0 I think if you actually follow closely my remarks yesterday in Turkey, you will be able to understand that this is something that I think needs to come out of this Geneva process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something that can be called a safe zone in a traditional way.\xc2\xa0 But when we talk about a cease-fire, is it actually possible to identify certain regions in the course of the negotiations by the parties in Geneva where people can feel particularly safe?</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not about influencing the matter from the outside; it is something that needs to come out of the process itself. Because we have tens of thousands of refugees along the Turkish-Syrian border -- we have to send a message to them.\xc2\xa0 There are other regions also where one might think of that.\xc2\xa0 Well, the cease-fire as a whole needs to be put in place, but these are areas where there is a particular obligation incumbent upon all the different parties where, for example, humanitarian access can guarantee, where the people don\'t have to have the impression they have to flee this particular area, as well, have again to go to Turkey or to other areas.\xc2\xa0 But it needs to be part and parcel of the Geneva negotiating process, and not something that comes sort of out of the blue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Chancellor, Mr. President, this is presumably your last joint sort of visit, or appearance, rather, here in Germany during your term.\xc2\xa0 If you were to draw stop what were your best experiences and what were your worst -- between Medal of Freedom and NSA affairs, if I may call it that?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Madam Chancellor, the United States actually wants Germany to do more as regards its military presence within NATO. Are you ready to increase, for example, soldiers and the contingent in order to achieve a deterrence via Russia in the east by locating ground troops there?\xc2\xa0 And should the United States not help more by absorbing, for example, more than 10,000 refugees from Syria this year?\xc2\xa0 And will you see to it that from G7 in Japan, a G8 process will evolve over time?</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLOR MERKEL:\xc2\xa0 I have the impression that we\'re actually quite busy with the conflicts that we need to solve in the world as of today.\xc2\xa0 And we have new tasks all the time on our agenda, so I am not in a position to draw stop now.\xc2\xa0 What you see is a testimony to our close partnership and cooperation and friendship based on mutual trust.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful for this because it helps us to solve international issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tGermany -- as I look at the term of office of President Barack Obama -- in many instances has become a more active partner, I think one can safely say, because we are also threatened, our very own security is threatened, and we realize that we cannot ensure this on our own.\xc2\xa0 We have to do this in alliance.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn certain areas we have shouldered a long-term mission that we\'re going to continue.\xc2\xa0 If I look at Afghanistan, for example, in a way we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a change of paradigm in the sense that we see this challenge of IS as something that is very acute.\xc2\xa0 So we send weapons into a conflict area.\xc2\xa0 We gave them to the Peshmerga, a completely new step compared to past policies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at the terrorist threat against France, for example, we\xe2\x80\x99ve shouldered responsibility in a mission in Northern Africa, which is also a new thing -- well, leaving the Congo mission aside where we spent some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if we meet in Germany, if we meet at G7 or again in Warsaw, we shall have other opportunities to meet -- the President and I.\xc2\xa0 We shall address all of these issues.\xc2\xa0 So let me say, for me, the future with the present is much more important than the past right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that we obviously have to make additional efforts as regards our possibilities to defend ourselves.\xc2\xa0 We have to put in more equipment, more personnel.\xc2\xa0 We know the targets that NATO has submitted to us.\xc2\xa0 We think that the whole positioning of our federal armed forces reflects fully our sense that we need to shoulder this international responsibility -- also, as regards, for example, cyber threats -- something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never neglected to do over the past years.\xc2\xa0 And I think that helps.\xc2\xa0 It helps us to tackle the challenges and to master them.\xc2\xa0 And the cooperation with the United States is indispensable.</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at the larger neighborhood of Europe, transatlantic cooperation within NATO but also in other fora is absolutely essential for maintaining our own security and safety.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Very briefly, I want to go back to Roberta\xe2\x80\x99s point.\xc2\xa0 As Chancellor Merkel mentioned, part of the notion of a cessation of hostilities is that the parties to the conflict would carve out areas in which, because the opposition is a signatory to that cessation, the regime agrees not to attack those areas.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\xc2\xa0 And here there\xe2\x80\x99s no space between us -- that if we can get the political transition to separate out areas where a moderate opposition that\'s at the table controls it, that should be a safe area.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s ISIL or Nusra, that\'s not a safe area.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the concept that we\'ve been trying to build.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s been framed in part because the Syrian regime has been cheating, in part because there are areas where Nusra and moderate opposition forces both reside and it\xe2\x80\x99s been difficult to separate them geographically.\xc2\xa0 But that concept of ultimately bringing some safety and security within the country is entirely consistent with what we\'re trying to do in our negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, with respect to the U.S.-German relationship and my relationship with Chancellor Merkel -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, I will repeat -- this is as important a relationship as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had during the course of my presidency.\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel has been consistent.\xc2\xa0 She has been steady.\xc2\xa0 She is trustworthy.\xc2\xa0 She has a really good sense of humor that she doesn\'t show all the time at press conferences.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s a little more -- she\xe2\x80\x99s much more serious in front of all of you -- which probably serves her well.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why she\xe2\x80\x99s been such a long-lasting leader, because she watches what she says.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you think about the first time I came here, we were in the midst of a potential collapse of the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that it was in large part because of our joint leadership, because of Europe and the United States and other partners around the world coming together and having a clear vision, that we were able to stabilize the global financial system.\xc2\xa0 And our two countries now have been able to grow steadily and reduce unemployment and recovered much better than a number of other countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you think about the Paris accord, that doesn\'t happen unless there\xe2\x80\x99s strong U.S.-German cooperation, and making sure that we are arresting the pace of climate change is as important as any issue that we\'re going to face in the decades to come.\xc2\xa0 Making sure that we\'re able to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon without resort to war, that occurred because of the partnership of the P5+1 and the leadership that Angela and others have shown.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Afghanistan, German troops have been vital in us assisting Afghans to defend their own country.\xc2\xa0 In Ukraine, the Normandy process, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, works in part because the United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Angela and President Hollande to draw a very firm line about the basic principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue in which we\'ve worked together where I have not been hugely appreciative of Angela\xe2\x80\x99s steady leadership and trustworthiness.\xc2\xa0 And as she noted, although it\xe2\x80\x99s true that I will be saying good-bye from this current position in around nine months, a lot happens in nine months.\xc2\xa0 Everybody kept on saying to me originally that somehow things would slow down in the second half of my last term.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.\xc2\xa0 I seem to be pretty busy.\xc2\xa0 And I look forward -- in addressing many of the challenges that we face, including those that we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss at NATO, those that we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss at the G7, those that we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss at the G20 -- to know that I have a strong partner in Angela Merkel.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast point I would make, with respect to European defense spending.\xc2\xa0 I think it is absolutely true that, under Angela\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, Germany has been more forward leaning on a whole variety of areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do continue to maintain -- and I will say this leading up to the NATO conference and beyond -- that given the pressures both from the south and the aggressive posture and enormous spending that we\'re seeing out of Russia, it is important for all of our NATO members to try to hit the target that we set in Wales of 2 percent of defense spending so that everyone is able to maintain the kind of defense capacity -- in part to prevent wars -- not necessarily to initiate them, but to be in a position where we can send a strong signal that we can meet our Alliance obligations and deal with these new and rapidly emerging challenges that confront Europe, as well as the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The second U.S. journalist that we\'ll recognize is Colleen McCain Nelson from the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 North Korea launched a ballistic missile from a submarine on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 Later, North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister told the AP that they will halt its nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its military exercises with South Korea.\xc2\xa0 Do you view that as a serious overture?\xc2\xa0 And at this point, how do you assess North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear capabilities?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd to Chancellor Merkel, you both have spoken about the strong working relationship that the two of you have.\xc2\xa0 As you look ahead to 2017 and the end of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s term, how do you view the possibility of working with a new U.S. president who has called your refugee policy \xe2\x80\x9cinsane\xe2\x80\x9d and has raised the specter of dissolving NATO?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 So, with respect to North Korea, we\'re still analyzing and assessing with precision the activities that North Korea engaged in over the last several days.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll let the Pentagon and our intelligence community debrief everyone once we have precise information.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is clear is that North Korea continues to engage in continuous, provocative behavior; that they have been actively pursuing a nuclear program, an ability to launch nuclear weapons. And although more often than not they fail in many of these tests, they gain knowledge each time they engage in these tests. And we take it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And so do our allies, and so does the entire world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s for this reason why we have continually mobilized the international community to isolate North Korea, to crank up the sanctions that impose a cost on Kim Jong-un and Pyongyang, and why we\'ve cultivated cooperation with the Chinese to put more pressure on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And although it is not where we would completely like it to be, I will say that we\'ve seen the Chinese be more alarmed and take more seriously what North Korea is doing, and they have been willing to be more forward-leaning in exacting a price on North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s destructive behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of overtures, we don\'t take seriously a promise to simply halt until the next time they decide to do a test these kinds of activities.\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve said consistently, dating back to the six-party talks, is that if North Korea shows seriousness in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, then we will be prepared to enter into some serious conversations with them about reducing tensions and our approach to protecting our allies in the region. But that\'s not something that happens based on a press release in the wake of a series of provocative behaviors.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do better than that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd until they do, we\'re going to continue to emphasize our work with the Republic of Korea and Japan, and our missile defense mechanisms, to assure that we\'re keeping the American people safe and we\'re keeping our allies safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLOR MERKEL:\xc2\xa0 As to your question, let me make two remarks.\xc2\xa0 First, I concentrate on the task ahead for 2016.\xc2\xa0 I\'m quite busy with that -- thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m looking with great interest at the American election campaign.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Chancellor, the President, a few days ago, said that it was a grave mistake not to have had a plan after the intervention in Libya ready.\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\'re confirmed by the fact that you abstained from that?\xc2\xa0 And do you feel that you are actually sufficiently supported in your policies after this decision was taken?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Mr. President, in Germany, there is very great resistance against particularly those private dispute settlement schemes in T-TIP.\xc2\xa0 And are you going to accommodate the Germans? And are you actually envious of the Chancellor that her term of office is actually unlimited, according to our constitution, compared to yours?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLOR MERKEL:\xc2\xa0 Actually, it\'s so interesting to me because I always have this six o\xe2\x80\x99clock at the back of my mind.\xc2\xa0 What was your question?\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, on Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel confirmed by --</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLOR MERKEL:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you take a decision that is different than the decision that one of your friends is taking -- it was an abstention at the time -- it\'s never easy, but you still remain friends and it still remains your joined goal that you\'re pursuing.\xc2\xa0 Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda now is something that\'s affecting us, it\'s affecting the United States of America, and it\'s affecting everyone.\xc2\xa0 We need to build up a functioning state in Libya, which is anything but easy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'re working so closely and with such commitment in trying to strengthen this unity government, and that\'s why we\'re trying to cooperate internationally in order to bring about this goal, and not have different goals that we pursue.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, basically, let\xe2\x80\x99s look ahead.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at what we want to achieve.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s try and stabilize this country.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not easy, not at all, because they have a tribal structure in Libya. They have a very -- well, a history very much their own.\xc2\xa0 They have a situation there on the ground that is such that they have never had a national army, never had a functioning state as we know it.\xc2\xa0 So all of these things come into the equation we have to think about when we try to stabilize the country, when we try to strengthen the population there.\xc2\xa0 And we do this together with the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 First, with respect to Libya, I want to be very clear.\xc2\xa0 I continue to believe that it was the right thing to do for us to intervene as part of a U.N.-mandated international coalition to prevent some of the potentially murderous behavior that Qaddafi was talking about.\xc2\xa0 I do believe that it was important for us to properly plan, prepare, and resource what came next.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was possible for us to do that effectively.\xc2\xa0 I think that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it as effectively as we should have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat does not negate, though, as Angela said, the importance of us all now investing in making sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a functioning Libyan government.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we now have a Government of National Accord, fragile as it is, requires us to do everything we can to encourage it.\xc2\xa0 And this is a conversation I\xe2\x80\x99ve had throughout my meetings during this trip -- whether in Riyadh, or London, or now here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the T-TIP negotiations, what you\'re seeing is differences continually narrowing.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the negotiators to try to find compromises and solutions on all these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe issue of dispute settlement is something that has gained a lot of attention and attraction among those who generally oppose trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind that the vast majority of trade agreements already contain such dispute resolution mechanisms.\xc2\xa0 And the terrible scenarios that are painted in which suddenly corporations are going around suing countries so that they are not able to enforce their public health laws, or their financial regulations, or their environmental laws -- none of these things had happened with the many trade agreements that currently exist, and that Germany and the United States and the EU and others are already a party to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to look at the facts and not a bunch of hypothetical pronouncements.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that, for example, in the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we\'ve negotiated, you have countries that right now have very few labor rights that now are required to have labor rights and, by the way, can be enforced by workers, the same way that corporations have.\xc2\xa0 You have environmental provisions that now are fully enforceable and that raise standards in countries that may not even have, up until this point, any serious environmental laws in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so if you look point by point, the issue is not whether or not there is going to be trade.\xc2\xa0 The issue is going to be under what terms.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that countries like the United States, countries like Germany that already have high standards, that already make sure that how businesses operate are not completely based on profit, but are also based on the common good, that that improves rather than detracts from the kinds of progressive goals that brought me into office in the first place. Otherwise I wouldn\'t support these laws.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with respect to your last question, I do not envy Angela Merkel for not having term limits.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said this before -- I love this job.\xc2\xa0 It is an extraordinary privilege, and I wake up every day knowing that what I do matters, and that I can help somebody somewhere, both inside the United States and around the world, make the world a little safer, a little more prosperous, help some child get an education, help some disease get cured.\xc2\xa0 It is an extraordinary privilege.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I have come to appreciate, at least in the United States, the wisdom of our Founders.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s healthy for a big, diverse country like ours to have some turnover -- to use a phrase from basketball, some fresh legs to come in -- and -- or to use another sports analogy, that I run my portion of the race and then I pass the baton to the next person.\xc2\xa0 And my goal between now and the time I leave is to make sure that when I turn over the keys to my office, that the desk is clean, and if the world is not completely tidy, that at least it\'s significantly better off than the way I found it.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, having said that, I\'m glad Angela is still sticking around, because I think the world benefits from her steady presence.\xc2\xa0 And she is to be admired for her remarkable endurance. And as a private citizen, I will continue to admire her and appreciate the work that she\'s doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBy the way, what\'s happening with respect to her position on refugees here in Europe -- she is on the right side of history on this.\xc2\xa0 And for her to take on some very tough politics in order to express not just a humanitarian concern but also a practical concern, that in this globalized world, it is very difficult for us to simply build walls, she is giving voice I think to the kinds of principles that bring people together rather than divide them.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m very proud of her for that.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m proud of the German people for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tCHANCELLOR MERKEL:\xc2\xa0 Danke schoen.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t5:45 P.M. CEST \xc2\xa0</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
