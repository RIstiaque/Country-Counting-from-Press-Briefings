Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:17 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all on this glorious Friday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 If ever there was a day to do the White House briefing outside, today would be it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rose Garden?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll just do this quickly and we can all go outside afterwards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got some discretionary authority. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require an act of Congress, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s freezing in here.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why that\xe2\x80\x99s always the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do a couple of things at the top, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll move to your questions.\xc2\xa0 It is a beautiful day and it is a Friday here at the White House, but me and so many other of my White House colleagues are a little wistful today.\xc2\xa0 It is the final day of service of a couple of my long-serving White House colleagues, and I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge their service.</p>\n<p>The first is -- many of you know Dag Vega, our Director of Broadcast Media, is -- today is his last day at the White House.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who has served with the President since the early days of his presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s a fan favorite with many of you.\xc2\xa0 I hear there\xe2\x80\x99s a profile of him on Univision that\xe2\x80\x99s coming soon -- at the risk of plugging one media outlet in front of a bunch of others.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But Dag has served the President for a long time, and really -- he has the kind of Rolodex relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s very rare and very valuable.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to miss him, but certainly wish him well as he pursues some endeavors in the private sector.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do we talk to him directly -- (laughter).\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I also want to acknowledge Matt Lehrich, who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on the side today.\xc2\xa0 Matt has been a spokesperson for the President since early 2007.\xc2\xa0 Matt started on the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 Matt and I first had the opportunity to meet in South Carolina in early 2008 on the President\xe2\x80\x99s primary campaign down there.\xc2\xa0 And everywhere that I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone since then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to have Matt come work alongside wherever I was.\xc2\xa0 So Matt has been a very loyal advocate for the President, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss him being around here on a regular basis, too.</p>\n<p>So with that, let me move to one other piece of presidential business and we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up to your questions.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the President spoke with Afghan presidential candidates, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Dr. Ashraf Ghani, to thank them for their leadership in reaching an agreement to form a national unity government and to accept the outcome of the full audit of the ballots in the June 14th runoff election currently being undertaken by the election commissions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He commended the two candidates for putting the interests of Afghanistan first and committing to working together as partners in governance.\xc2\xa0 Noting that the audit is steadily progressing, the President encouraged both candidates to publicly endorse their previously agreed political framework and continue their dialogue on the details of its implementation to ensure the Afghan people have full confidence in the ongoing electoral process and outcome.</p>\n<p>He reiterated that there is no justification for rhetoric that threatens extra-constitutional measures and urged Dr. Abdullah and Dr. Ghani to continue to move forward in the spirit of collegiality to maintain national unity during this historic democratic transition.</p>\n<p>The President indicated that Secretary Kerry would continue his close consultations with the two candidates and President Karzai in the days to come.\xc2\xa0 The President also reaffirmed the enduring American commitment to the Afghan people and their future.</p>\n<p>So with that, Darlene, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you have anything to add to reports that a one-week cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians is going to be announced later this afternoon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to confirm those reports at this point.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President sent Secretary Kerry to the region earlier this week with one specific goal, which was to bring about an end to the violence as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So Secretary Kerry has been very deeply engaged in those efforts.\xc2\xa0 He has traveled -- he has been in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 I know that he also traveled to Jerusalem, I believe, this week as well.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been in contact with U.N. officials, with officials at the Arab League, with officials and his counterparts in Qatar and Jordan and Turkey, as well as dealing with Palestinian and Israeli leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s been deeply engaged in these conversations.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty dynamic situation, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any announcements that they\xe2\x80\x99re preparing to make.\xc2\xa0 I know that many of these details are also being very carefully negotiated, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to interfere in those negotiations even inadvertently.</p>\n<p>So Secretary Kerry has been very hard at work this week in pursuit of a very important goal, which is bringing an end to that violence as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And if there are any announcements to any progress that\xe2\x80\x99s made in that effort, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them announce that out there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the White House like to see a pause in the fighting of one week, or longer?\xc2\xa0 Or is one week all that you can get under the circumstances?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our priority is trying to bring cessation to the violence as soon as possible; that every hour in which this violence continues there are innocent civilians on both sides of that border who are at risk.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we are quite concerned about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This ongoing violence has had tragic circumstances -- or tragic consequences, I should say, for innocent civilians on both sides of the border.\xc2\xa0 We mourn the loss of innocent civilians on both sides.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that international efforts to bring about a cease-fire as soon as possible will be successful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99s having in a little while with the Presidents from Central America, what is it that he will specifically ask them to do to stem the flow of unaccompanied children across the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is part of a -- today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting is part of a whole-of-government approach that this administration has pursued to deal with the urgent humanitarian situation at the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of this summer, there has been a steady influx of unaccompanied children who have been apprehended along the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I mentioned I believe a week or so ago, the early trends for the month of July indicated that that flow was starting to recede a little bit.\xc2\xa0 But our efforts continue.\xc2\xa0 And one important part of our effort has been trying to stem the flow at the source, and that has meant that this administration, primarily through CBP but also through the State Department, has been engaged in a public messaging campaign in Honduras, in Guatemala and El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 That campaign has been focused on making it clear to the populations of those countries that they should not send their children on that very dangerous journey to the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 That messaging has also made clear that even if against long odds those children are able to safely make that journey, they will not automatically be welcomed with open arms in this country.\xc2\xa0 And that is an important part of our effort, and the President will certainly talk with those Presidents about that ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>Another thing that we have done in coordination with those countries is try to establish an efficient way to facilitate the repatriation of individuals who have been apprehended in this country.\xc2\xa0 We have demonstrated our commitment to enforcing the law, and also ensuring that those individuals get the due process to which they\'re entitled.\xc2\xa0 So there have already been, as you all have reported, flights sponsored by the U.S. government to repatriate some individuals back to their home countries.\xc2\xa0 Those repatriation efforts are ongoing, and they are done in conjunction with local efforts as well.</p>\n<p>After all, we don\'t want to be in a position where we are repatriating individuals back into a violent situation.\xc2\xa0 We want to try to find a way that we can meet the humanitarian needs of these individuals.\xc2\xa0 And working with host governments to establish repatriation centers is an important step in that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be offering them any money --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been some programs that the State Department has announced that have been instrumental in this effort.\xc2\xa0 There are already some ongoing and critically important law enforcement operations and programs that beef up citizen security efforts in these countries.\xc2\xa0 Many of the individuals who are pursuing this journey are fleeing pretty desperate situations, and the desperation that they are feeling is fueled by violence in their communities.</p>\n<p>So using United States law enforcement programs and resources to try to improve security in those communities is part of this effort.\xc2\xa0 There are also a number of development programs through USAID that can be useful in improving the economic circumstances, or even just the living conditions of individuals in these countries.\xc2\xa0 So there are some existing programs and some programs that over the last several weeks have been enhanced to try to address some of the root causes of this illegal migration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this summer.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO said just before you came up here that more than 15,000 Russian troops are now on the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 And earlier today the Pentagon said that Russia appears to be set to transfer more rockets to the separatists, possibly as early as today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you have any reaction from the podium about this latest development.\xc2\xa0 And secondly, whether the White House is getting more worried that the sanctions regime to this point isn\xe2\x80\x99t having the intended effect of getting Russia to deescalate.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been saying for a few months now, Roberta, that we are very concerned about the transfer of weapons and materiel from the Russian side of the border into Ukraine and into the hands of Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That has fueled the violence and conflict that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, it has also had tragic consequences for citizens from countries around the world after the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jetliner.</p>\n<p>In fact, last week, when the United States -- the day before the downing of that jetliner -- announced new set of sanctions against Russia, we noted specifically that these sanctions were aimed at Russia\xe2\x80\x99s continuing efforts to provide weapons and materiel to the Russian-backed separatists.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also called on President Putin and other leaders in Russia to use their influence with those separatists to urge them to abide by a cease-fire agreement.</p>\n<p>In terms of the sanctions regime that has been put in place, there are a number of steps that the United States has taken against individuals in Russia but also against some large commercial entities in the banking, defense, and energy sectors.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence -- if you look at some of the economic data out of Russia -- that those sanctions are having an economic effect.\xc2\xa0 They have had an impact on economic projections that have been performed by outside agencies.\xc2\xa0 I know that the IMF and others, the World Bank I believe, have downgraded their future economic projections for Russia in terms of economic growth in that country.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of capital flight and flows of capital out of Russia.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that international investors are wary or even reluctant, because of the unstable situation, to continue making investments there.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing that the Central Bank in Russia is concerned about the health and well-being of the currency there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Russian Central Bank extend significant sums -- expend significant sums of money trying to shore up the strength of their currency.</p>\n<p>So it is clear that Russia has had to take a number of steps to respond and deal with the sanctions regime that the United States, in coordination with our allies, has imposed.\xc2\xa0 So those economic costs have been imposed on Russia and felt by Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if your suggestion is that they have not had yet the desired effect in terms of getting Russia to adhere to some basic international norms in their dealings with Ukraine, that\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the United States continues to be in touch with our allies in Western Europe about additional economic costs that could be imposed.</p>\n<p>The President stood at this podium last week and indicated his assumption that the downing of that jetliner would be a head-snapper for the international community.\xc2\xa0 And it is clear that Russia is more isolated than ever in this circumstance because of their aiding and abetting of Russian separatists who killed 300 innocent people.</p>\n<p>So this is something that we continue to be focused on.\xc2\xa0 Even as the President traveled this week, he was in touch with some of his counterparts in Europe.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that conversations between senior administration officials and their counterparts in Western Europe about dealing with this situation in Ukraine will continue over the weekend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest reaction to the resignation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 How much additional uncertainty or turmoil does that inject into the situation there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports of Prime Minister Yatsenyuk\'s resignation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Ukrainians for details about the status of their coalition government.\xc2\xa0 President Poroshenko, who was recently elected, of course remains in place, and we continue to cooperate closely with the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll note that the President has made a couple of phone calls to President Poroshenko just in the last few weeks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the ties between our two countries and the cooperation between our two countries endures.</p>\n<p>The fact is that any coalition government in any country is going to have varying views among its parties.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve expected at some point that there would be new parliamentary elections in Ukraine in any case.\xc2\xa0 So this is part of domestic politics in Ukraine, but it does not in any way affect the United States\xe2\x80\x99 relationship and support for the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people as they confront the destabilizing activities of their neighbor.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issue of sanctions, it sounds like there are active conversations going on.\xc2\xa0 How soon could we see a new round of sanctions?\xc2\xa0 And how confident are you that the EU would join the U.S. in another round of sanctions, in terms of intensity and severity?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Europeans themselves speak to their willingness and desire to put in place additional economic costs.\xc2\xa0 Given the tragedy that we saw last week, and given Russian complicity in that tragedy, I think it is a reasonable assumption from any outside observer that the international community, including Europeans, are more motivated than ever to impose additional economic costs against the Russians. \xc2\xa0But, again, that will have to be a decision that they will make for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They will, however, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident, continue to make those kinds of decisions in coordination with the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why there have been so many phone calls, frankly, between this side of the Atlantic and that side of the Atlantic.\xc2\xa0 In terms of timing, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer specific details about the timing of a new round of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before in this room, it would be unwise strategically for me to send clear signals about the content or timing of sanctions that would only allow those who were the target of those sanctions to make early efforts to try to get around them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to your point about the fact that Putin still clearly isn\xe2\x80\x99t yielding to the sanctions, some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s critics -- one, William Cohen, former Secretary of Defense -- has said that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown enough leadership in terms of corralling European leaders.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those critics who say he really needs to step up here and pressure Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President play a very visible leadership role in organizing the international response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I say that not just as an observation about the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments in the aftermath of the Malaysia Airlines tragedy.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- all along, the international community has been closely coordinating with this government under the leadership of this President to respond to this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President continues to work closely with our allies to make progress on this.\xc2\xa0 The international community is united, and the Russians are isolated.\xc2\xa0 And some of that is a result of the outrageous actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Russians.\xc2\xa0 But some of that is also a result of this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in organizing the international response to this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just domestically, Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz acknowledged on MSNBC earlier today that the administration is considering a refugee program that would impact a small number of kids in Central America.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us where those considerations stand and what a small number would look like?\xc2\xa0 Is that thousands of kids?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, this is among the things that the President will be discussing with the Central American leaders later today.\xc2\xa0 As you know, for a number of weeks now, this administration has been focused on what kinds of steps we can put in place to deter illegal migration from Central America.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a number of steps.\xc2\xa0 The public messaging campaign that I referenced earlier that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on ensuring that individuals don\xe2\x80\x99t make that long journey has been a focal point of our efforts.</p>\n<p>We have also sought additional resources to expand our detention facilities so that when individuals are apprehended at the border they can be detained and processed through the system.\xc2\xa0 Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also devoted additional resources to that immigration court system so that these cases can be processed more quickly and efficiently.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is that we want to efficiently enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you have seen some of these repatriation flights take place, because we are committed to not just enforcing the law, but also demonstrating in front of the international community, in the eyes of the public, that we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 That serves as a deterrent effect.\xc2\xa0 That is clear evidence that making the dangerous journey and arriving on the southwest border does not grant one free access to the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have also sought additional authority and deployed additional resources to counter criminal networks that are facilitating so much of this illegal migration.\xc2\xa0 Breaking up those criminal networks continues to be a focal point of U.S. law enforcement, but also law enforcement officials in Mexico as well.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly gratified with the international cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from the Mexicans in particular on that matter.\xc2\xa0 And the contemplation of this pilot program that would allow for some in-state processing is merely the continuation of our effort to try to deter individuals from traveling from Central America to the U.S. border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no decision has been made yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No specific decisions I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to announce from here.\xc2\xa0 But this is a program that we have talked about internally at the White House, and the President will be discussing with those Central American leaders.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important for your viewers to understand that this pilot program is aimed squarely at deterring those individuals who may be contemplating a trip from Central America to the southwest border with the U.S.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask, how many people would likely be involved in such a program?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to make a sizeable dent in these huge numbers we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at the border?\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow with another subject, too.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our intent would be that, regardless of how many people are able to go through the program -- and at this stage it\xe2\x80\x99s too early for me to say what those numbers would look like -- but our broader intent here is, as a broad message of deterrence, that people would see that there is an organized process if they feel like they have a legitimate asylum claim, that they don\'t need to make the dangerous journey to the U.S. to make that asylum claim, that they can be processed in their own country.</p>\n<p>And that would -- we hope will serve as a pretty effective deterrent.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the point of a pilot program like this.\xc2\xa0 But, again, this is still in the discussion phase.\xc2\xa0 And if we have more to talk about today after the meeting, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get you some additional information at that point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I also ask you about the state of play on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re about a week from congressional recess.\xc2\xa0 Looks like the latest take on what the Republicans in the House are going to give you is something on the order of a billion dollars, and all contingent on changes to the 2008 law.\xc2\xa0 Is that enough money?\xc2\xa0 Are you willing to go along with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I think this may be one of those situations where your question indicates a little bit more optimism than even I have.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s usually the reverse.\xc2\xa0 I guess in this case it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the many things I appreciate about you, Mark.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should he be more cynical?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all, not at all.\xc2\xa0 I think my rare display of cynicism is actually rooted in Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s comments from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I saw that he did a news conference where he was asked basically the question that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me:\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to say at this point that Congress probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to strike a deal on legislation to deal with this immigration crisis before you all go home for a month?\xc2\xa0 That was the question that was posed to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker responded by saying, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to talk to our colleagues, and these conversations are going to continue today and again tomorrow.</p>\n<p>That is not -- those are not the words of somebody who is, as the President might describe, feeling the fierce urgency of now.\xc2\xa0 The President and this administration three weeks ago put forward to Congress a very specific proposal for the resources that this administration needs to deal with what even Speaker Boehner himself acknowledges is a pretty serious problem at the border.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Congress is a lot of talk, but not really any action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is a disappointment, both because it is an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to live up to their own rhetoric when it comes to dealing with this issue.\xc2\xa0 I think we also have seen that there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty strong feeling by the American public that this is a situation that needs to be addressed and be addressed in a way that is consistent with American values, in terms of providing for the basic humanitarian needs of these individuals, but also ensuring that the law is enforced.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also a public safety question here.\xc2\xa0 And Governor Perry, when he met with President Obama, raised concerns about the public health impact of having individuals who were apprehended on the border detained on American soil.\xc2\xa0 He expressed concerns about whether or not they had immunizations and other basic health needs that could be met.\xc2\xa0 Included in our supplemental appropriations request is additional money for HHS to make sure that those basic health care needs are met, both to meet the humanitarian needs of those who have been apprehended, but also to ensure the safety of the public in these communities where these individuals are detained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So Republicans themselves acknowledge that the proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s included in the appropriations request would meet some of the needs -- many of the needs that they themselves have identified as a priority.\xc2\xa0 But yet, all we see from Congress are conversations that are going to continue today and again tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s rather disappointing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about that number though -- a billion dollars -- less than a third of what you asked for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what we think that we need.\xc2\xa0 If there are additional proposals that Congress will actually act on, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly willing to have conversations with them about what they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do.\xc2\xa0 But, again, all we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from the Speaker of the House is talk that\xe2\x80\x99s not backed up by any action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Staying with immigration -- why is the President going to send an assessment team to the border to determine whether the National Guard is required?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Mike, the President had the opportunity to visit with Governor Perry down in Texas just a couple of weeks ago, as I mentioned to Mark.\xc2\xa0 In the context of those conversations, Governor Perry indicated that it might be helpful to deploy some National Guard resources to the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve made pretty clear that those individuals who are interested in adding resources to the border to provide for border security should be strong supporters of comprehensive immigration reform that would invest about 20,000 boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Governor Perry suggested that sending 1,000 boots of National Guard troops to the border would serve as a deterrent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So despite that slight intellectual inconsistency that\xe2\x80\x99s articulated by the Governor, the President, demonstrating his commitment to acting in bipartisan fashion, said he would at least consider the request that Governor Perry had made.\xc2\xa0 So part of considering that request to send additional National Guard troops to the border, the President directed the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to dispatch an assessment team to the border to see what sort of DOD resources might be useful in helping address the situation there.</p>\n<p>After all, we would want to make sure that any additional resources that are sent to the border are closely coordinated with the widespread efforts that are already ongoing there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it raises a few questions -- and I wanted to follow on Mark -- what House Republicans say they want to do at this point is to allocate money to send -- to have the feds basically to pick up the tab for the National Guard.\xc2\xa0 Would you be in favor of that portion of their proposal?\xc2\xa0 And, number two, when this has been done in the past -- President Bush did it in 2006 -- there were conflicts with existing law enforcement like the Border Patrol.\xc2\xa0 What are your concerns that the National Guard could be effective in actually stopping the flow, as opposed to interfering with existing law enforcement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, just to take the last part of your question first, the problem that exists at the border right now is not that there are individuals who are seeking to evade detection at the border.\xc2\xa0 Rather, individuals are crossing into this country and seeking to turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents, state law enforcement officials in Texas, even local law enforcement officials, in an effort to escape the elements, which are pretty severe at this time of year, but also to pursue their claims through the immigration process.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult to explain about the National Guard request -- that the issue is not ensuring that we can detect everyone; the concern is about having the resources to process those who are detected and apprehended through the immigration system in a way that is efficient and consistent with our commitment to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why our supplemental appropriations request has included a request for resources that could be used to hire additional judges and prosecutors and asylum officials to process these claims.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s an argument for allowing the National Guard to actually detain people, which they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to do unless you actually -- the President actually made that stipulation within whatever action he took.\xc2\xa0 Is that what the President wants to do, allow them to detain people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what Governor Perry has said is that he wants to send the National Guard to the border because it would be an important symbol and serve as an effective deterrent to those who might be contemplating traveling to the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that Governor Perry himself has said that he believes they should be given the kind of law enforcement authorities that would allow them to detain individuals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But you do highlight an important issue that also warrants mentioning.\xc2\xa0 If there are additional resources that are deployed to the border from the Department of Defense, the National Guard or anybody else, we want to make sure that they are appropriately integrated with the efforts that are already ongoing along the border.\xc2\xa0 Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got Border Patrol, ICE, state law enforcement officials through the Texas Department of Public Safety, and local law enforcement officials who are all working together to try to address this challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And those are just the individuals who are actually serving a law enforcement function in terms of apprehending individuals.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole separate set of federal agencies -- HHS, DHS, FEMA -- who are coordinating the humanitarian response to make sure that those individuals who have been apprehended can also be detained in a humanitarian way.</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of resources that have been deployed to deal with situation.\xc2\xa0 And anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s contemplating adding to those resources, we want to make sure that any additional resource are appropriately integrated into the system that\xe2\x80\x99s already in place.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you probably know, two of the Presidents of Central America, of these countries that are here today, have been making these rounds yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And there was a call yesterday for the White House to spend less on law enforcement at the border and more on education initiatives in their country and efforts to get rid of the gangs, because they came as a result of Merida and other, what they call effective programs in Mexico and in Colombia.\xc2\xa0 And I just wonder if that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table and what the White House response is to the idea that you also have to change the conditions in these countries or be a part of that in order to change the reason why people are coming.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of the substance of the conversations that the President will be having with these Central American officials is to talk to them about what we can do to stem the tide at the source.\xc2\xa0 There are already some development programs that have been put in place through USAID to try to address some of the economic and quality-of-life concerns that individuals in these countries may have.\xc2\xa0 So there already are American resources that are being devoted to that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other thing that we can, that is the subject of a lot of conversation even outside this latest situation, is extending and enhancing law enforcement cooperation between law enforcement agencies in Central America and in the United States.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that means offering some expertise and resources to local law enforcement about steps they can take to enhance security in communities in their country.\xc2\xa0 This Citizen Security Initiative is something that the President talked about when he traveled to Central America a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>So this will be the subject of ongoing conversations.\xc2\xa0 It has been so far, and it will be part of the conversations between the leaders today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any money in this latest proposal for these types of development initiatives.\xc2\xa0 Is there an appetite to add that to the current proposal or to look at a second proposal along those lines?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an option on the table, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for specific guidance about resources that have already been devoted to this effort and for additional resources that are available to address some of those concerns.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Hensarling this morning said that he had written to the President asking the President to stop Russia from engaging in Ex-Im Bank financing.\xc2\xa0 He said the President has the power through the authority now to intervene.\xc2\xa0 Is that a good idea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roger, I have to admit I have not seen the letter from Congressman Hensarling.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at the letter, see if we\xe2\x80\x99ve received it, and get back to you with an answer then.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another question -- there are two Federal Reserve Board of Governors vacancies right now.\xc2\xa0 One left in March 13th, the other May 28th.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sort of holdup to naming new persons on the board?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no holdup that I know of, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also not in a position to make any personnel announcements from here today beyond the notes that I mentioned earlier about Dag Vega and Matt Lehrich.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re in the running to be appointed to the Fed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything imminent --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about timing at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has Russia moved multiple launch missile systems across the border into Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to give you the latest intelligence assessment.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a pretty strong track record, and there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate that there has been, unfortunately, a steady flow of heavy weapons across the border from Russia into Ukraine and into the hands of these Russian-backed separatists.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be very concerned about that.\xc2\xa0 We do know that it was an SA-11 system that was in the hands of separatists that brought down the Malaysian airliner last week.\xc2\xa0 We know that Russia had been involved in training separatists to use that system.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the Russians are responsible for that and why the international community is now focused on isolating the Putin regime and getting them to change their behavior in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were apparently one or more systems moved close to the border earlier.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not somewhere around after 10:00 p.m., and they thought they might move them over today.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder whether you knew that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer a specific detailed intelligence assessment about today\xe2\x80\x99s movements of heavy weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there firing across the border in either direction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have seen in the last couple of days, according to some social media reports but also to some intelligence assessments that have been released by the intelligence community, reports that there has been firing of Russian heavy weapons from the Russian side of the border at Ukrainian military personnel.\xc2\xa0 We have detected that firing, and that does represent an escalation in this conflict.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Pentagon and the State Department both talked about this a little bit yesterday, but it only underscores the concerns that the United States and the international community has about Russian behavior and the need for the Putin regime to change their strategy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are you going to do about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with the international community to further isolate Putin and Russia<strike>,</strike> and to discuss imposing additional economic costs on Russia for their activities in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not meaning to be snarky, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying all along, and nothing much seems to have changed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned to Roberta, there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate that the economic costs that have been imposed on Russia have been felt by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of steps that have been taken by the Central Bank to try to shore up their currency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen outflows of capital, which is an indication that international investors are wary of investing in Russia right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 So there is evidence to indicate that the sanctions regime has had an impact on Russia, but what you point out is that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet changed President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s calculus for his intervention in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That is why the international community is actively engaged in conversations about whether or not -- and how -- to impose additional economic costs and further isolate him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question, though, that\xe2\x80\x99s often raised here is why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has acted many times.\xc2\xa0 The President nine days ago announced a new sectoral sanctions regime against some entities in the defense, financial, and energy sectors in Russia.\xc2\xa0 So there have been a number of steps that this President has already taken.\xc2\xa0 Those are, as some pointed out, more serous steps than our European counterparts have taken so far; that we have seen indications that the Europeans are preparing to take some additional steps.\xc2\xa0 They made some preliminary steps to that effect just yesterday, I believe.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- the President has, as is evidenced by the facts, led the international response to this effort.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to play a leadership role in focusing the international community\xe2\x80\x99s attention on this urgent problem and using that attention to further isolate Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, at a briefing yesterday, one of the Central American Presidents blamed America\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for illegal drugs, and a flow of American weapons south for creating the conditions in these Central American countries that the kids are trying to get away from.\xc2\xa0 How much responsibility do we bear for this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess, Wendell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not enough of an expert on Central American politics to give you a very good assessment of that claim.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that the desperate conditions that exist in Central America is feeding the flow of illegal migration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Central America to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Now, fortunately, according to the data, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that flow recede the first couple of weeks of this month.\xc2\xa0 That said, our efforts to confront this problem continue.\xc2\xa0 That will be the substance of some of the conversations that President has later today with those Central American Presidents.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to push Congress to take action on the resources request that has been sitting on their doorstep for three weeks now.\xc2\xa0 There are additional resources that can be used to improve security at the border, to more efficiently process those individuals through the immigration court system, and make sure that we are repatriating those that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal basis for remaining here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, some immigration activists in this country say -- since Speaker Boehner signaled comprehensive immigration reform wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen this year, the President began to look toward an executive order.\xc2\xa0 They feel that executive order will be aimed at reducing deportations from the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Is that a proper read?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think anybody who claims to have some knowledge about the executive actions the President is contemplating is merely guessing.\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is he said he wants his Attorney General and his Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of existing law and determine what steps the President can take using his executive authority within the confines of that law to address some of the more persistent problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>So they\xe2\x80\x99re out there casting a wide net.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re conducting that review.\xc2\xa0 And they intend to forward that review to the President of the United States before the end of the summer.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that the President will act quickly after that.</p>\n<p>But in terms of what the results of those executive actions will be, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear yet because it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear yet what those executive actions themselves will be.\xc2\xa0 What is clear -- there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing that is clear -- which is that House Republicans have blocked the kinds of solutions that would be more far-reaching to addressing those problems.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate because there\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan proposal that was passed through the Senate that has the support of the business community, the labor community, the faith community and the law enforcement community.\xc2\xa0 There is strong support for this compromise proposal, and the only reason that it\xe2\x80\x99s not law right now is that House Republicans have engaged in a political strategy to block it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some of those activists are being briefing here at the White House by the President\xe2\x80\x99s advisors.\xc2\xa0 Are they being told that the President would like reduce deportations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give a detailed readout of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 What I know about them, though, is that most of the communication is the other way.\xc2\xa0 As the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General conduct a review about authorities that are available to the President within the confines of the law to address this problem, they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in the ideas of activists and other experts who may have some suggestions for how that authority could be used to address some of these problems.</p>\n<p>But again, in terms of what the outcome is going to look like, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wait until that review has been conducted and the President has made a decision about what executive authority he\xe2\x80\x99d like to exercise.</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to be clear, when you were talking about the pilot program earlier you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a program that would start in Honduras and then move into El Salvador and Guatemala, is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, I think that some of these details are awaiting a presidential-level conversation, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But what has been discussed, I guess is the most accurate way to say it, is a program that would set up facilities in some Central American countries to allow asylum claims to be processed in those states -- or in those countries, I guess I should say for the sake of clarity.\xc2\xa0 That would -- right now, what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is individuals who feel like they have asylum claims making a very dangerous journey from Central America to the southwest border where they\xe2\x80\x99re then put in the immigration system in this country, they\xe2\x80\x99re detained in this country while their asylum claim is considered.</p>\n<p>The idea here is that in order to deter them from making that dangerous journey, we\xe2\x80\x99d allow -- we\xe2\x80\x99d set up a system, in coordination with these host countries, to allow those claims to be filed in that country without them having to make that dangerous journey.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the idea, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our other deterrence efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not confirming that that\xe2\x80\x99s how it would -- the discussions of it, that that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed to start Honduras with the pilot program and then move into the other two?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the countries where these would be located, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm that right now.\xc2\xa0 But you understand the general idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just -- on Ukraine -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a little over a week obviously since MH17.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any doubt that that plane was brought down by separatists by an SA-11 system?\xc2\xa0 Is there any doubt about that now at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have seen is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that there were heavy weapons moved from Russia to Ukraine, that they have moved into the hands of separatist leaders, and that those separatists who are backed by the Russians were trained by the Russians to use those systems.\xc2\xa0 Those systems include anti-aircraft weapons systems.\xc2\xa0 And according to social media reports, those weapons include the SA-11 system.</p>\n<p>What we also know is that the Malaysia Airlines jet was brought down by a missile that was fired from the ground.\xc2\xa0 It was fired from the ground in an area that was controlled by separatists and in an area where the Ukrainians themselves were not actually operating anti-aircraft weapons at that time.</p>\n<p>So that is why we have concluded that Vladimir Putin and the Russians are culpable to this tragedy.\xc2\xa0 And I guess the other thing I would point out -- let me look for my notes here -- that I noticed a recent comment from Senator Chambliss, who is the vice-chair of the Senate Intel Committee.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican and somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often agree with the White House.\xc2\xa0 But he did say, whether it was -- this is a quote here -- \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it was the Russians themselves that pulled the trigger or Russian separatists trained by Russians, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same, and it all goes back ultimately to Vladimir Putin.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is an indication that, based on somebody who has reviewed the classified intelligence assessments, that President Putin is responsible.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we are coordinating with the international community on a response that targets Russia for their actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that you\xe2\x80\x99re 100 percent certain and you have no doubt?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that sort of assessment is something that would be delivered by the intelligence community, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d let do that.\xc2\xa0 What I was able to review for you, though, was the intelligence that has been provided that I think paints a pretty clear picture about what exactly happened and who exactly is responsible.\xc2\xa0 That is an assessment that Senator Chambliss, somebody who has reviewed the classified intelligence on this matter, agrees with.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can follow up -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty extraordinary statement I heard in the most direct way I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it from you.\xc2\xa0 You just said \xe2\x80\x9cVladimir Putin and the Russians are culpable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So that leads to the immediate question, which is, what do you about it?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned what the President did nine days ago; that was before that plane was down.\xc2\xa0 So what will be done to hold the Russians and to hold President Putin accountable for the downing of that plane?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that the President imposed this sanctions regime in coordination with our allies the day before the jetliner was down is an indication of how aggressive the President has been leading the international community to confront the bad behavior of the Russians in this circumstance.</p>\n<p>So I\'m glad that you mentioned that in your question.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question that you\'re asking now is a relevant one, which is what is the international community\xe2\x80\x99s response going to be in light of this terrible tragedy.\xc2\xa0 The President was pretty clear that he anticipated that this would be a head-snapper for the international community in terms of paying attention to a troublesome situation that they had previously, I think at least in some countries, had hoped they could get away with ignoring.\xc2\xa0 It\'s apparent that continuing to ignore this situation has had tragic consequences for at least 300 innocent civilians who were not even from either Ukraine or Russia.</p>\n<p>So what the President will continue to do is to lead the international response to confront this effort.\xc2\xa0 And that means working with the international community to impose additional economic costs in the hopes of changing President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s calculus for dealing with this specific situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s one thing he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to change his calculus for what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do forward.\xc2\xa0 But as we talked about earlier this week, your U.N. Ambassador had said that the perpetrators of this must be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 What is the idea -- what does that mean, being \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to justice\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean some more sanctions, or is there something beyond that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to justice\xe2\x80\x9d language is a reference to the investigation into what exactly happened in terms of bringing down the jetliner.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'ve called for this transparent international investigation and for investigators to be given unfettered access to the crash site.\xc2\xa0 I understand that the Ukrainians have given that authority to the Dutch to lead that investigation, and that investigation will necessarily lead to a review and an investigation into who personally is responsible for downing that jetliner.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the words that you used was \xe2\x80\x9cVladimir Putin and the Russians are culpable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are culpable for the situation, right, that they have been responsible for supplying the terrorists with these -- or the separatists with these weapons.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But didn\xe2\x80\x99t you use that in conjunction with the downing of that plane?\xc2\xa0 You said Vladimir Putin and the Russians are culpable.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, because of the intelligence that I had laid out earlier that has already been released by the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re asking a different question, which is those who are directly responsible be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 And that is a reference to an ongoing investigation about who specifically targeted that plane and fired the weapon that brought it down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who pressed the button and who was there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can just -- a clarification on the border situation.\xc2\xa0 Your pessimism -- it looks like Congress is not going to act on any supplemental -- providing any supplemental funds to deal with this crisis.\xc2\xa0 What will be the impact on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what are the consequences we\'re going to see?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to impair your ability to address this crisis?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I assume it obviously will impair it to some degree.\xc2\xa0 But what are the stakes we\'re talking about here, Congress leaving town doing nothing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the biggest consequence is just that one of our priorities was to -- well, was to prioritize the cases, the immigration cases of recent border crossers; that we are going to devote the additional judicial resources in the form of judges and prosecutors and asylum officials to more quickly process the claims of those who have been apprehended so that we could more efficiently enforce the law.</p>\n<p>There are some resources that already exist that we can dedicate to that effort, and the President has made the decision to move some resources from the interior and focus them on the border.\xc2\xa0 But there are additional resources that we would like to get access to so that we could just hire additional judges and prosecutors and put them on these cases.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact that you\'re not going to get that, what\xe2\x80\x99s it going to mean?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What that will do is that will just extend the backlog that already exists.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that we\'re concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to any Republicans during this -- since he released that, has there been any direct contact with Speaker Boehner, with Marco Rubio, with other Republican leaders, House or Senate, to try to push this thing through?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you would need bipartisan support to pass it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any presidential-level phone calls, but I know that there have been a number of conversations between White House officials and officials on Capitol Hill in both parties about this matter.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been really clear about there should be -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no ambiguity about our request is, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everybody knows what you want, but in politics you have to engage, you have to push, you have to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering what kind of direct negotiations there are -- kind of shoe-leather work with Congress to get this done, specifically with Republicans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, Speaker Boehner himself said that he was still discussing among his members what they felt like they could do.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound to me like they\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to begin negotiating, at least begin negotiating with the White House.\xc2\xa0 It still appears that they\xe2\x80\x99re, three weeks later, three weeks after we made our request, the House Republicans are still negotiating among themselves what to do.</p>\n<p>We\'re concerned about this because there\xe2\x80\x99s only one week left before they depart Washington, D.C., for their annual five-week recess in August.\xc2\xa0 And that means that this is a pivotal week that\'s coming up.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of priorities that remain undone.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re pretty concerned about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sorry, just one more question on the executive order front.\xc2\xa0 The President has been pretty consistent over the last several years that he did not have the authority to stop deportations.\xc2\xa0 Remember he said in 2010 that such a move would be -- \xe2\x80\x9cthis could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration and it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The refrain year after year from the President, going back as long as we\'ve been talking about immigration, is that anything done on this would have to be done through congressional action.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the position of the White House, that you do not have the authority unilaterally, on your own, without Congress, to radically slow deportations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly -- the President does not have the executive authority that Congress has to take the kinds of steps that would confront so many of the problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 What the President has directed his Attorney General and his Secretary of Homeland Security to consider is whether or not there are some steps within the confines of the law that could be used to mitigate some of these problems.</p>\n<p>But these solutions that would be deployed through executive action are not as far-reaching as those actions that could be taken by members of Congress through the passage of congressional legislation.\xc2\xa0 Particularly when you consider what the Senate has already done in terms of the legislation that they\xe2\x80\x99ve passed with bipartisan support that would have a tremendous impact on the broader economy on dealing with the estimated 11 million individuals who are undocumented but in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m just asking very specifically, does the President still believe he does not have the authority without Congress to radically slow deportations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\'re trying to, through the assessment that\'s being conducted by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, trying to determine exactly what authority the President does have.\xc2\xa0 What I can assure you of -- and I think what the President was alluding to in those remarks that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in the past -- is that any steps that he takes unilaterally will not be as impactful as the steps that Congress could take by passing legislation that\'s already passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The only reason it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t passed through the House, of course, is because it\xe2\x80\x99s simply been blocked by House Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is his goal to slow deportations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, our goal is to try to address so many of the problems that have been created by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 If you listen to the rhetoric of Democrats and Republicans, many people acknowledge that there are a wide range of problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 What we want to try to do is pinpoint what problems can be mitigated through the use of executive authority.\xc2\xa0 Any solution that we\'re able to put forward will not be as impactful as congressional legislation.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 On the sanctions, is the question whether it\'s \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d still, or just \xe2\x80\x9cwhich and when\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask, last night when you all put out a readout of the conversation with Prime Minister Rutte, it said \xe2\x80\x9cthe President and Prime Minister agreed that Russia must not be permitted to destabilize the situation in Ukraine without incurring additional costs and that, accordingly, the international community will need to enact additional sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s no \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d at this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of when and which ones you pick.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s certainly the position of the United States, Peter, that additional costs should be imposed on Russia and Putin for their actions in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, our counterparts in Europe will have to make their own decision about the steps they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>We saw some positive indications yesterday in some preliminary steps that they had announced.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are meetings among European leaders next week and they have set a deadline for the end of the month, which is a week ago yesterday, for trying to come to a decision about what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xc2\xa0 So we do believe that additional steps should be taken, but ultimately those are decisions that have to be made by those European leaders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is not referring to U.S. sanctions.\xc2\xa0 You\'re not saying more U.S. sanctions are coming, it\'s just a question of when and which ones?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the readout in front of me.\xc2\xa0 I think the reference -- I\'m not trying to dodge the question.\xc2\xa0 I think the reference is to our view that additional costs in one form or another need to be placed on the Russians to try to get them to change their calculus for the way that they\xe2\x80\x99re acting in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So the obvious step -- the next obvious step would be for the Europeans to take action.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is also considering additional action as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different subject.\xc2\xa0 On the health care lawsuits this week, the rulings, this Jonathan Gruber video -- do you have a response to this?\xc2\xa0 Your critics are saying this shows that, in fact, there was an intent or at least the knowledge that this law was not intended to mean subsidies would be provided in the instances the Court --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have -- I mean, the thing that Mr. Gruber has said is that even by his own analysis and projections, he had always assumed that all eligible individuals would get tax credits whether or not their state marketplace is run by federal officials or local officials.</p>\n<p>I\'d also point out that Mr. Gruber filed an amicus brief in the Halbig case, taking the administration\xe2\x80\x99s side that all individuals should get access to those tax credits as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re eligible to get them.\xc2\xa0 So I think his views on this are pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 I think that he described those remarks as a mistake, but I\'d refer you to his explanation for why he said them.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear is that he, like Congress, intended for every eligible American to have access to tax credits that lower their health care costs regardless of who is operating the marketplace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said at the time it was not intended, that in fact this was meant to be an incentive to states to sign up -- to do their own rather than to sign up with the federal system.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that he said that\'s a mistake, that those comments were a mistake and didn\xe2\x80\x99t represent his views.\xc2\xa0 I do think that there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate, based on his own analysis, his own projections, and even his own legal filings, that he supports the administration view that every eligible American should have access to those tax credits.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, even others in the administration were calling on the Israelis to take greater steps to minimize civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 And you had these awful deaths at this U.N. school in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not exactly clear who is responsible for that, I don\'t believe.\xc2\xa0 And then later in the week you had this outrage expressed in Israel and here in the United States over the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to halt flights into Tel Aviv.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious -- where are U.S.-Israeli relations right now?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that they were listening to your call, the White House call earlier this week to take greater steps to minimize civilian casualties?\xc2\xa0 And what did you make of that outrage that was being expressed in Israel about the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s actions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, I\'m glad that you brought up the terrible violence that we saw in Gaza yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I do want to note that we are deeply saddened and concerned about the striking of a U.N. Relief and Works Agency school in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 We convey our deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in this incident, as well as the U.N. staff.\xc2\xa0 We, again, urge all parties to redouble their efforts to protect civilians.</p>\n<p>In terms of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, those are decisions that are obviously made independent of the White House.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, though, is that the FAA was in close touch with Israeli officials as they were making those decisions.\xc2\xa0 The decision that the FAA announced was made with a specific goal in mind, and that goal is ensuring the protection of the traveling public, particularly Americans who are traveling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The FAA sought additional assurances from the Israelis before making their decision to lift that ban.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they did -- they got those assurances and they made the decision based on their own criteria and calculation.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is actually, Jim, evidence of the close coordination that continues between the Obama administration -- even independent elements of the Obama administration at the FAA -- with the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me just finish here.\xc2\xa0 That FAA decision, though, was cancelled almost in the middle of the night, after it was extended for up to 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 Was there political pressure that was being felt here at the White House, in the administration, to let that halting of those flights expire early?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a decision that was made --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that no political, I guess, considerations are being made in terms of FAA\xe2\x80\x99s actions, but were there political considerations in terms of ending that FAA action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The FAA made this decision independent with one goal in mind, which is ensuring the safety of the traveling public.\xc2\xa0 And the thing that I want to point out about that timeframe that I think is also relevant to this is they put in place a 24-hour ban on flights into the international airport in Israel.\xc2\xa0 Then, they put in another 24-hour ban, which I think is an indication that they were serious about what they were trying to achieve in terms of ensuring the safety of the traveling public.\xc2\xa0 When they received the necessary assurances from the Israeli government, they lifted that ban immediately.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that is indicative of a healthy working relationship and of the close coordination and communication that exists, again, between different elements of the Obama administration and the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Secretary of Homeland Security has said that if you don\'t get the border supplemental money that the President has requested, that you could start running out of space to house the children down there at the border.\xc2\xa0 How real is that prospect?\xc2\xa0 And given that kind of dire consequence, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President feel it necessary to call the congressional leaders over here to the White House to work out some sort of compromise?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems as if the problem here is that the Republicans really want to change that 2008 law and the Democrats really want that money.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also said that the administration would also like to change the 2008 law.\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t the President just broker some sort of compromise here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would like to see congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And right now, as I pointed out earlier, Jim, it seems to me, based on the comments of Speaker Boehner, that right now House Republicans are still negotiating among themselves.\xc2\xa0 That\'s unfortunate, because the administration --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats have all sorts of ideas as well.\xc2\xa0 They disagree with you about the 2008 changes to the law.\xc2\xa0 I mean, so there are differences on both sides.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that when the President is supposed to step in and --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s a fair assessment, because I do think that we\'ve seen Democrats in the Senate seek to take some specific steps to try to advance an appropriations request along the lines of what we\'ve put forward.\xc2\xa0 I think they made some tweaks to our proposal, but they are moving on a supplemental appropriations request.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Right now, House Republicans who are in charge of the House legislative process are currently focused on negotiating among themselves.\xc2\xa0 What they apparently don\'t have to negotiate among themselves is their focus on legislation next week that will allow the House to file a lawsuit against the President of the United States for merely doing his job.\xc2\xa0 That, I would posit, is an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got their priorities a little mixed up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Dan Pfeiffer said earlier this morning that, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not discount\xe2\x80\x9d impeachment as a possibility.\xc2\xa0 Do you really believe that the President could be impeached?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there are senior members of the Republican political party or certainly prominent voices in the Republican Party who are calling for exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who is that?\xc2\xa0 Sarah Palin is one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She mentioned it.\xc2\xa0 Somebody mentioned earlier that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She would be a prominent voice in the Republican political --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody in the Republican leadership seriously talking about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Sarah Palin considers herself to be a leader --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hang on, Jon, it\'s my question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of fundraising emails from the Democratic Party with the word \xe2\x80\x9cimpeachment\xe2\x80\x9d in it.\xc2\xa0 This sounds like a fundraising ploy, a political ploy, not a real thing.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t really think the President is going to be impeached, do you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think that there are some Republicans, including some Republicans who are running for office, hoping they can get into office so that they can impeach the President.\xc2\xa0 That is apparently a view that they hold, because it\xe2\x80\x99s one that they have repeatedly expressed publicly.</p>\n<p>I think what\xe2\x80\x99s really important --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office looking at this?\xc2\xa0 Are you studying the possibility of being impeached?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that I think is important about this.\xc2\xa0 And again, we\xe2\x80\x99re coming up on a pivotal week.\xc2\xa0 Next week will be the last week that Congress is in session before Labor Day.\xc2\xa0 There are at least two items of business that members of Congress themselves have identified as important priorities.</p>\n<p>I do think that they\'re right in that the American people share the idea that these are priorities.\xc2\xa0 The first is this supplemental appropriations request.\xc2\xa0 Everybody acknowledges that additional resources are needed to deal with this problem that we have at our border, both in terms of adding some elements of border security, but also adding some element of public health care in terms of making sure that those individuals who are apprehended at the border get the health care that they need, and that they don\'t pose a public health threat to the communities where they\'re detained.</p>\n<p>There are a wide variety of resources that are included in that resources request, and unfortunately we have not seen action from House Republicans on that.</p>\n<p>We have also not seen action from House Republicans on the VA reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of this summer talking about.\xc2\xa0 We saw a lot of congressional Republicans racing to be interviewed by television reporters asking them about the importance of reforms to our Veterans Administration system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Consistently, congressional officials -- Republicans -- indicated that that was an important priority, that it was the least that we could do for our veterans and their families.\xc2\xa0 But here we are, one week before Congress is about to leave town, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no discernable path that Congress is going to make progress on this.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we see House Republicans giddy about the prospect of passing legislation along party-line vote to pursue a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the President of the United States merely for doing his job.</p>\n<p>That is an indication that House Republicans don\'t have a clue about the priorities of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I hope that they\xe2\x80\x99ll spend some time over the weekend thinking about it, maybe even talking to some of their constituents about what the priorities should be.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll see some action on some things that Democrats and Republicans in Washington and across the country agree need action.</p>\n<p>Right now, all we get from House Republicans is a lot of talk and some action on a partisan, taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the President.</p>\n<p>JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, it seems the Israeli Cabinet has just rejected Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s cease-fire proposal.\xc2\xa0 Is it time for the President to discuss with the Secretary additional incentives, additional reworking of the proposal?\xc2\xa0 And although it has never been traditionally the way this administration feels about negotiating with terrorists, as Hamas is called, under these extenuating circumstances now, is it possible that Secretary Kerry may, in fact, meet with some of the leadership of Hamas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, JC, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to react to those reports that apparently emerged in the middle of the conversation we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having here this afternoon.</p>\n<p>The way that Secretary Kerry has pursued this cease-fire agreement is he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also talked to a number of other leaders, including those -- leaders of other countries, including those that have some influence over the Hamas leadership.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t deal with Hamas directly, but there are some other leaders and officials in other countries that do have a solid working relationship with Hamas.\xc2\xa0 And it is through them that we engage in these kinds of conversations.</p>\n<p>But again, the goal that the Secretary of State is pursuing is a very clear one, which is to bring an end to the violence as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Back on CNN question, how concerned is this administration with the remainder of the elections that we have left?\xc2\xa0 Because that could translate into articles of impeachment being pushed forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing some of them could already be written up and just waiting for changes in the -- the changes over there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, April, there are some prominent members of the Republican Party who have articulated their support for articles of impeachment.\xc2\xa0 That is the view that they\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is the business of the American people.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very clear about what his priorities are.\xc2\xa0 His priorities involve advancing American interests around the globe, even in the midst of some tumultuous circumstances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is focused on his domestic agenda that starts with expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans in particular seem to have some different priorities.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them try to explain to the American public what those priorities are, and that will be their difficult task.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So going back to my question, what is the concern of this White House as it relates to this election and the possible outcomes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the election is still a few months away.\xc2\xa0 I think our primary concern right now is that there are urgent priorities that are being blocked by House Republicans right now.\xc2\xa0 Those priorities include reforms to the VA.\xc2\xa0 Those priorities include the additional request for resources to deal with the problem at the border.\xc2\xa0 House Republicans are blocking common-sense immigration reform that\'s already passed the <strike>House</strike> [Senate].\xc2\xa0 House Republicans are blocking measures to raise the minimum wage to ensure equal pay for equal work.\xc2\xa0 A range of other important economic proposals.\xc2\xa0 That really is the focal point of our concern at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, Paul Ryan is looking to merge some anti-poverty programs.\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts, what\xe2\x80\x99s the thoughts around here at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to review those programs in much detail.\xc2\xa0 I know that the previous House Republican proposals have decimated the kinds of programs that are so critical to middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class.</p>\n<p>The Republican explanation for why those Republican -- those programs need to be gutted is that they are looking for money so that the can increase tax cuts for the wealthy and the well connected.</p>\n<p>I am told that there are some proposals that are included in Chairman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that mirror some of the things that the President has advocated.\xc2\xa0 I know that there is a proposal in there that would expand earned income tax credit benefits to some workers that don\'t actually have children.\xc2\xa0 I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal for criminal justice reform in there.\xc2\xa0 So there may be an opportunity for us to find some common ground to advance some priorities for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see how serious Chairman Ryan actually is about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything new?\xc2\xa0 Any information on the U.S.-Africa Summit that\'s about a week away?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing new, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll have more about it next week.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nakamura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on what Jim asked earlier, the Secretary of Homeland Security has said that ICE will run out of money in August, and CBP by September, if you don\'t get emergency funding.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean to national security?\xc2\xa0 And what contingency planning are you making if you don\'t expect Congress to come through by the end of next week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS for what impact Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act would have on their day-to-day operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House is concerned about that in terms of -- or looking at that -- is the White House looking at that, what would happen if they run out of money?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that White House officials, particularly those who work over at OMB, are in regular touch with agencies about the funding that\'s necessary for their agencies.</p>\n<p>But in terms of what the ultimate impact of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act would be, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with those agencies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing you mentioned that -- the National Guard is deployed by Governor Perry, and he said he would like it to fit in with other law enforcement efforts to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no confusion.\xc2\xa0 Have there been conversations by the President with -- follow-ups with Governor Perry since the time they met and since he\xe2\x80\x99s announced this?\xc2\xa0 Have there been from the White House?\xc2\xa0 Has there been any communication between the administration at large with the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s staff on this particular question since he has announced it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the -- I know that there has been a couple of conversations between White House staff and a member of Governor Perry\xe2\x80\x99s staff about the supplemental appropriations request that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward to Congress and about Governor Perry\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to deploy additional National Guard resources to the border.\xc2\xa0 There have been some ongoing conversations about those things, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is the administration becoming more comfortable and understanding more about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the practical consequences of those conversations is the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s staff has become better educated about what exactly proposals the administration has put forward for dealing with these challenges.\xc2\xa0 That kind of coordination is critical to addressing some of these problems.</p>\n<p>I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s already an ongoing and strong working relationship between the Texas State Department of Public Safety and federal border security officials as it relates to coordinating those efforts.\xc2\xa0 We just want to make sure that if additional resources are provided, that they are integrated into those relationships that already work pretty well.\xc2\xa0 Okay?</p>\n<p>Jared, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Since your cynicism about Congress has already been primed today, is the President going to be similarly disappointed if he sees a CR proposal before the August recess?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Say that last part again.\xc2\xa0 I guess I didn\'t quite get the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a continuing resolution pushed by Republicans in the House before the August recess, some Democrats in Congress have said that this would be a bad idea, jumping the gun before, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still time to do that.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be disappointed in seeing a CR before the August recess?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a position about whether or not the House should act on the CR before the Congress recess.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out what I think are sort of our priorities right now, which are getting this supplemental appropriations request through Congress and getting these VA reforms through Congress.</p>\n<p>I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s also some talk of them taking some action, even on a short-term extension of the Highway Trust Fund; that would also be an obvious priority.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite as cynical or pessimistic about their efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a couple times today you\xe2\x80\x99ve quoted the Speaker about immigration.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker has also said that he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in impeaching the President.\xc2\xa0 So why do you believe what the Speaker says when it comes to immigration but not when it comes to impeachment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do believe that the Speaker on a number of occasions said that there were not going to be steps taken by Republicans to shut down the government over health care.\xc2\xa0 We did see that that happened.\xc2\xa0 So again, maybe that means that you need to ask him a little bit more about whether impeachment is on the table or not, and maybe he can give you a more detailed answer than he has thus far.</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there are other prominent voices in the Republican Party that have strongly advocated impeachment.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s part of their agenda.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda is not focused on those kinds of political sideshows, but is actually focused on advancing an agenda that will expand economic opportunity for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>So with that, why don\'t I do a week ahead, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys get outside to enjoy this beautiful Friday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 One second here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Press conference?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Which day is that?\xc2\xa0 Good question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President will participate in the Summit of the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders.\xc2\xa0 April, you mentioned this.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will deliver remarks and participate in a roundtable earlier in the day.</p>\n<p>The three-day summit will cap off the Washington Fellowship, the flagship program of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Young African Leaders Initiative, and give 500 of sub-Saharan Africa\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent young leaders the opportunity to engage with U.S. government officials, entrepreneurs, civil society representatives, as well as leaders in international development.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, the President will award the 2013 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will also attend.</p>\n<p>And, April, we will have some more information about that Young African Leaders Summit next week.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House before that evening where he will depart for, yes, Kansas City, Missouri, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll remain overnight, a fine -- a fine city for the President to visit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Eric going on that trip?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted that the President is going, but Eric will be traveling with the President that day.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a disappointment to me as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is there a fundraiser associated with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe so.\xc2\xa0On Wednesday, while in Kansas City, the President will deliver remarks on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Kansas City, Missouri early next week.\xc2\xa0 That evening, Wednesday evening, the President will return to Washington.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will deliver remarks at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President and First Lady will host a Celebration of Special Olympics and a Unified Generation at the White House to mark the anniversary of the Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>On Friday of next week, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And with that, I wish you all a very happy weekend.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M.
