Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:48 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all on this beautiful Friday.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Carney is off chaperoning his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s field trip today, so I assume that he\xe2\x80\x99s answering a different variety of questions this afternoon, but probably not necessarily fewer questions.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s doing that today, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI do want to get started with a couple of things I just want to flag for you, both of which you already know about, but I just want to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the resources we have on this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is, you heard the President talk in the Rose Garden just about 90 minutes ago or so about his commitment to making sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see student loan interest rates double at the end of next month.\xc2\xa0 So I would make sure that you took a close look at those remarks from the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is we have just posted at WhiteHouse.gov a blog -- a new blog posting, from Jeanne Lambrew and Gene Sperling, here at the White House, about the Medicare Trustees report that was just issued, or at least just made public in the last couple of hours.\xc2\xa0 What the Medicare report indicated was that the life of the Medicare program, since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, has been extended by nearly a decade.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is just another piece of evidence to indicate that the strategy that the President has put forward and has codified into the Affordable Care Act is working; that this idea that we can bend the cost curve, we can -- that by bending the cost curve through the Affordable Care Act, we can lower costs for seniors, we can lower costs for Medicare, and we can reduce the deficit overall.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that was one piece of data to indicate that we\xe2\x80\x99re making some progress on this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we find encouraging.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some more technical details and other pieces of -- there are actually some other more technical things that are also good indications about the future of that program that are included in the blog post, so I strongly commend that to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, Tom, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you take the first question today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to pursue that report you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 It also showed that Social Security didn\xe2\x80\x99t improve at all; it\xe2\x80\x99s still at a 2033 date when it runs out of money.\xc2\xa0 Despite the increased revenues of the government and lowering of the deficit, in the Medicare report that you mention, it showed that a main reason for the slight improvement was a decline in health care costs.\xc2\xa0 And some of that has been due to a low -- a weaker economy -- people spending less money on unnecessary operations like that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I wonder if you see any real optimism in both reports, or if you think the fact that, especially with the Social Security, that nothing has improved.\xc2\xa0 Is there any impetus there for the White House to try to reach out and try harder for common ground on both of these subjects?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take you to those individually.\xc2\xa0 I think -- let\xe2\x80\x99s do your Medicare question first, which I think is -- this is a question that people have been posing for some time, that we have seen since the Affordable Care Act a decline in costs, or at least a -- or, by some measures, a decrease in the rate of growth.\xc2\xa0 And so people have speculated about whether or not this is due to a poor economic climate or if it is due to the impact of the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, I do think what is evident over the last four years, we have seen the economy steadily improve and we have seen more aspects of the Affordable Care Act take effect.\xc2\xa0 And so even in the face of an improving economy, and as the Affordable Care Act gets implemented, we have actually seen that costs are contained in terms of either costs going lower or their rate of growth decreasing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the available evidence would indicate that a good portion of that, at least, is attributable to the strategy that the President has pursued in the Affordable Care Act -- that there are a number of things included in the Affordable Care Act that are aimed at bending the cost curve.\xc2\xa0 For example, this is reducing overpayments to hospitals.\xc2\xa0 It is bundling payments in the Medicare program that would increase efficiencies.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s forcing hospitals and doctors to examine readmission rates.\xc2\xa0 So one of the leading drivers of increasing health care costs are patients that go and see their doctor and then have to be admitted to the hospital for one reason or another.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we can improve care and reduce costs at the same time.\xc2\xa0 This is having a positive impact on the deficit, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this all in a way that actually reduces costs overall.\xc2\xa0 And this stands in stark contrast to what Republicans have advocated, which is shifting costs to seniors.\xc2\xa0 So I think this is a pretty strong endorsement of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would also readily acknowledge that this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see over time, but all of the indications that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the course of the last four years are moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, we would encourage you to grade us over the long term, and we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic about the direction that we\xe2\x80\x99re headed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, when it comes to Social Security, that is a different measure.\xc2\xa0 And what this report shows is, actually, it also validates something that the President and other members of this administration have been saying, which is that Social Security is not driving our short-term deficit challenges -- because, as you point out, the trust fund is solvent through 2033, so for another two decades.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat being said, the President believes that Social Security is incredibly important.\xc2\xa0 It has guaranteed retirement with dignity for generations of Americans now, and that is something that should be continued.\xc2\xa0 And the President has identified that as a priority, and the good news is, is that there are many Republicans who have identified that as a priority as well.\xc2\xa0 And I think both sides acknowledge that the way that we will address that problem is by acting in bipartisan fashion to do so.\xc2\xa0 Both sides are committed to do that; the President certainly is.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation we\xe2\x80\x99ll have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One initiative the President did suggest on that was to change the inflation formula, the chained CPI, which would over time reduce the increases due to inflation.\xc2\xa0 It\'s gotten very little traction on the Hill from either party.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that -- is he going to keep pushing for that, or is that just one you\'re not going to work too hard on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said about this chained CPI is that this reflects his effort to compromise.\xc2\xa0 So this isn\'t the President\'s ideal approach for dealing with some of our deficit challenges, but it is -- it demonstrates a willingness on his part to try to find common ground with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 If we saw a similar effort from Republicans on the other side to try to meet the President halfway when it comes to dealing with our longer-term deficit challenges, then we\'d probably be making more progress right now.\xc2\xa0 But we should be clear about what that CPI proposal actually included.\xc2\xa0 And that represented an effort on the part of the President to try to compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the subject of compromise, no sooner had the President talked this morning about student loans than John Boehner on the Hill said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I\'m talking about, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- playing politics and that the difference between the two versions weren\'t that different -- one locks in a rate, the other one changes every year based on economic things.\xc2\xa0 And Boehner says he thinks that can be worked out.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think there\'s any common ground in here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We do think that there\'s a way for us to work this out, and we\'re hopeful that we\'ll be able to reach an agreement with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 There are some significant differences between what Republicans have acted on and what the President supports.\xc2\xa0 Those differences include, under the Republican plan, it doesn\'t actually lock in the low interest rates for students that would be applying for loans next year.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re at historically low interest rates.\xc2\xa0 We should lock those in.\xc2\xa0 Under the Republican plan, it would be a variable interest rate.\xc2\xa0 So you could basically see that over the course of the next two or three years, if interest rates do increase, that the interest rates on those loans would increase.\xc2\xa0 It makes sense that we should lock in the low rates.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Republican plan eliminates safeguards that were in place for lower-income families.\xc2\xa0 It is evident to anybody who is paying attention that in the 21st and in a 21st economy, a college education is going to be critically important for anybody that wants to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So, trying to make sure that we include safeguards for lower-income families needs to be a priority.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not included in the Republican plan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then the last thing is the Republican plan doesn\'t necessarily guarantee an affordable repayment plan.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward this proposal to make sure that we are -- that when students or graduates or families are repaying the loan, that we can cap the repayment at 10 percent of their discretionary income.\xc2\xa0 This will ensure that students and families aren\'t handicapped by the legacy of a college education, the college education costs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are some differences between what Republicans have put forward and what the President and other Democrats on the Hill, frankly, support.\xc2\xa0 So that said, despite these differences, we are encouraged that House Republicans have taken some action on this.\xc2\xa0 As you\'ll recall, 12 months ago when we were having this debate, Republicans were refusing to take any action at all and were simply content to allow interest rates to double within a month.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'re encouraged that the Republicans have changed their posture on this, and certainly willing to enter into a conversation with them about how to address some of these problems that are still embedded here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President and the NATO Secretary General reach any conclusion on how many troops to leave behind in Afghanistan after 2014?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any announcements along those lines today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President nearing any decision on how many U.S. troops to leave behind?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates for you at this time, Steve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran\'s oil minister says that the sanctions are not having that big of an impact, that they\'re still able to export a lot of fuel.\xc2\xa0 Is there a need for more sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve, thanks to the leadership of this President and the efforts of our allies and partners around the world, we have put in place a very strict sanctions regime against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that is all because the international community is united around the principle that Iran needs to live up to their commitments when it comes to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the Iranian regime may be trying to mislead their own people, but make no mistake about what the facts indicate here.\xc2\xa0 The production of crude oil in Iran has fallen by approximately 700,000 barrels per day since 2012.\xc2\xa0 So in just the last year, we\'ve seen a decrease of 700,000 barrels a day.\xc2\xa0 Iran\'s oil exports have decreased by more than 1 million barrels per day.\xc2\xa0 The decrease in exports has cost Iran approximately between $3 billion and $5 billion in lost revenue each month.\xc2\xa0 We spent a lot of time talking last year about the impact of these sanctions on the currency in Iran.\xc2\xa0 Iran\'s currency has lost half of its value since the beginning of 2012.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the inflation rate in Iran is spiraling.\xc2\xa0 According to the official estimates from Iran, inflation has increased 31.5 percent a year.\xc2\xa0 The truth is that data is a little skewed; the truer number may be closer to 40 percent.\xc2\xa0 So there is an effort by the Iranian regime to try to mislead people about the impact of these sanctions.\xc2\xa0 The impact of these sanctions is clear.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the other important thing for people to understand is there\'s a way for the Iranian regime to address this.\xc2\xa0 They can live up to their international obligations when it comes to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 They can rejoin the international community.\xc2\xa0 And it will alleviate some of the concerns and a lot of the strain that\'s been placed in the Iranian economy if they\'re willing to do that.\xc2\xa0 Because the unfortunate thing is of course that it\'s the Iranian people who are bearing the brunt of this -- and that is unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the responsibility of the regime to step up and actually represent the interests of their people the best.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, lastly, a Michigan woman has been killed in fighting in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information about her -- what she was doing there, who she was fighting for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen those reports, Steve, but I don\'t have any information about that at hand.\xc2\xa0 You might check with the State Department who may be able to fill you in on that a little bit.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon, I\'ll give you the next one.\xc2\xa0 But if folks in the back want to raise their hands, I\'m happy to jump around a little bit today.\xc2\xa0 So while you\'re thinking of your next question, Jon, I\'ll give you the next one.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I want to go back to the student loan question.\xc2\xa0 So the House Republicans passed their plan.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any meetings, any discussions with Republican leaders in the House to try to work out a compromise?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific meetings from the President to read out to you at this point.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, officials at the White House are in regular touch with our counterparts on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\'ve identified as a priority and something we spent a lot of time working on last year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that some Republicans on Capitol Hill have identified this as a priority, too.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that conversations will continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he\xe2\x80\x99s got to get a big event here to put pressure, obviously, on the House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Are there any negotiations, even not with the President?\xc2\xa0 Any real effort to kind of pick up the phone and talk to them and say, hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re partway there but can we work out something?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific secret negotiations to read you into, but there is a genuine effort on the part of people here at the White House to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged that there seems to be an interest among Republicans on Capitol Hill to also address this problem.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 There are some problems that persist here, and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in trying to work with Republicans to solve it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President picked up the phone to talk to Senate Democrats?\xc2\xa0 Because, as I understand it, Senate Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t moved at all on the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal here, and at least the House Republicans have passed something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there are a number of measures that are being actively considered by the Senate Democrats -- by the Senate that had been put forward by Senate Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the House Democrats have been talking about some proposals, too.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, I think this is just more evidence we should be able to find some common ground to solve this problem if we have House Republicans who are doing something they don\xe2\x80\x99t do very often -- which is actually passing legislation to address a real policy problem; you have Senate Democrats and House Democrats putting forward specific proposals; you have the President with his own specific proposal.\xc2\xa0 There are some differences among these proposals.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that everybody has made this a priority should be encouraging that we can solve this problem before the end of the month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be at least a little irritated, though, with the Senate for not -- I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re a month away from these interest rates doubling, and the Senate has not moved forward.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- it takes time to get legislation passed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It takes some time.\xc2\xa0 And I think that even members of Congress would say that things take a little longer to get done in Congress than they would like.\xc2\xa0 But the President actually is supportive of the plan that Senate Democrats have put forward.\xc2\xa0 They put forward some -- a common-sense proposal that would address some of the concerns that I laid out at the top.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some time to work this out and everybody has got some ideas about how to do it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work through the process to get that done.\xc2\xa0 Either way, we need to get this done before the end of next month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move to the back a little bit here.\xc2\xa0 Nadya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The White House keeps insisting that President Assad shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be part in any political future of Syria --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- yet there is -- people believe that maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re open for a little bit of role for him in the transitional government, which is a condition for the opposition to participate, but many people believe, especially the Russians, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen without him.\xc2\xa0 Are you open for him playing any role at all?\xc2\xa0 Can you rule out any role for him to play in the future negotiations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have said that Assad must go and that there is no future for him in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is not just our opinion, but that would -- that is the will of the Syrian people that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, and that is for a variety of things, not the least of which is the terrible violence that he\xe2\x80\x99s perpetrated on his own people.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we have asked is that in the context of these discussions that are underway sort of on both sides to try to get both sides to sit down around the table in Geneva, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the Russians to take some responsibility to exercise the influence they have over the Assad regime to ensure that the negotiators who appear on behalf of the Assad regime are empowered to negotiate the full transfer of executive authority from the Assad regime to a transitional government.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is -- those empowered negotiators are critical to us reaching the kind of solution that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly in the best interest of people like Russia that have a significant stake in the outcome of this pretty troubling situation.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also in the interest of those who are concerned about the continued destabilizing impact that this is having on the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get to a place where we can have a transitional government in place.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require some leadership to be shown on the part of the Russians.\xc2\xa0 The United States and our partners and our allies are certainly willing to do our part to encourage the Syrian Opposition Council to participate in a constructive way in those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s through these negotiations that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to eventually try to address the problem that exists there and put an end to this terrible, terrible violence that\xe2\x80\x99s taken the lives of so many innocent people in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a quick follow on that.\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Kerry said that he\xe2\x80\x99s convinced that the Syrian opposition will take part in the Geneva talks.\xc2\xa0 Has he communicated that to the President?\xc2\xa0 Is the President confident of that as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations to read out to you between the Secretary of State and the President.\xc2\xa0 But certainly, the Secretary of State has been engaged in a series of conversations, not just with his Russian counterparts, but with other partners in the region.\xc2\xa0 So he would be in a position to make that assessment probably better than anybody else that lives in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I want to get you to respond to something that House Speaker John Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson said, Brendan Buck.\xc2\xa0 He says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe White House would no doubt love to change the subject from all of its various scandals.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Was part of the goal today to shift the conversation away from the IRS, the DOJ?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The exclusive goal of the event today was to continue to reinforce the priority that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 And that priority is something that the President noted in his remarks, which is that the North Star of domestic policymaking in this White House is expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is answering the three questions that the President posed in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 These are the questions:\xc2\xa0 How do we make America a magnet for jobs and opportunity?\xc2\xa0 How do we make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re equipping American workers to compete for those jobs?\xc2\xa0 And how do we make sure that those -- that hard work on behalf of those American workers actually leads to a decent living?\xc2\xa0 And that answering those three questions is what animates the domestic policymaking process at this White House.\xc2\xa0 It is at the top of the agenda every day that the President sets foot in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on every single day, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President was talking about making sure that we open up the doors to a college education to as many American kids as possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, if you talk to education officials, they say student loans are important but the broader problem is that the cost of education keeps increasing.\xc2\xa0 So why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President focused on that as well, or more focused on that, given it\xe2\x80\x99s the root of the problem?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the reason that he gave the remarks today centered on this one issue is because we have this looming deadline that\xe2\x80\x99s coming up next month.\xc2\xa0 But the President has talked for some time about the broader priority of trying to -- I guess to borrow a phrase that we were talking about with Tom earlier -- bend the cost curve of a college education, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the rates keep going up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They do keep going up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need -- the President has talked about trying to put incentives in place that would ask colleges and universities to make reducing costs a priority, and that withholding some federal funding could be a consequence of them not making that a priority.\xc2\xa0 So lowering the cost of a college education by putting pressure on colleges and universities to lower those costs is one part of this tool.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has talked about -- well, the other thing I would cite to you is, the CFPB, under the leadership of Richard Cordray, has this \xe2\x80\x9cKnow Before You Owe\xe2\x80\x9d program that makes it easier for college students and their families to assess exactly what kind of debt they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take on.\xc2\xa0 We put forward a college scorecard that allows people to compare college costs among different schools so people can make an informed decision about what kind of debt they\xe2\x80\x99re going to incur based on which college they choose to attend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a number of things that we have done to try to address what the President does see as a significant problem.\xc2\xa0 But the reason that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about this one particular issue today is that congressional action is required, and it\xe2\x80\x99s required before this looming deadline is met at the end of next month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just one more on the IRS.\xc2\xa0 Is the President upset or angry about the fact that there are employees who were involved in targeting conservative groups who are still in their jobs getting taxpayer dollars?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the President, who I think has pretty forcefully expressed his concerns and anger -- I think you could even -- many of you would -- had described it -- at the wrongdoing that occurred at the IRS.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there is also a 30-day review that\xe2\x80\x99s in place.\xc2\xa0 So we have an acting IRS commissioner.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a career civil servant; somebody who served a Republican administration and a Democratic administration, who\xe2\x80\x99s conducting a top-down review at the direct instruction of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that that review will take a look at a wide range of things, including making sure that we hold accountable those who are responsible for this wrongdoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move to the back again a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to Iran and talk about Pastor Saeed Abedini.\xc2\xa0 His wife, Naghmeh, met, as I understand, with the U.S. U.N. Ambassador yesterday.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be speaking before the rights council, the Human Rights Council at the U.N. on Monday.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you could share what the administration has been doing on his behalf.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, you have asked me a question that I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to answer right now.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s not an answer that exists.\xc2\xa0 So let me take that question, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you and see if we can provide you some more details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one last?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 James Comey is taking a lot of heat from rights groups because of his involvement with the security policies of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you were able to share the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of Comey\xe2\x80\x99s record in that area.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared at this point to talk about that only because I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting out there about who the President may or may not choose to be the next director of the FBI.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to influence that reporting in any way by commenting on the credentials of one candidate or another.\xc2\xa0 I know that Mr. Comey is somebody that certainly has the respect of the President for all that he\xe2\x80\x99s done throughout his career.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s an accomplished prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to weigh in with a specific appraisal of his characteristics for a job that he\xe2\x80\x99s not yet been appointed to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, if I could follow up on Steve\xe2\x80\x99s question about the American woman who was killed in Syria.\xc2\xa0 What would the White House say to other Americans who are thinking about getting involved in that conflict on either side of the equation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to offer advice to Americans about travel to foreign countries.\xc2\xa0 So if there are Americans that have questions about -- they\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating a trip to Damascus, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage them to consult with the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And earlier this morning, Dan Pfeiffer tweeted out an article from The Atlantic magazine that said that the former commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Schulman, only visited the White House 11 times and not 157 times.\xc2\xa0 Was that a statement of fact on the part of the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that was the citation of a report from The Atlantic Monthly.\xc2\xa0 So I -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in this circumstance.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact of the matter is, the only reason we\xe2\x80\x99re having this conversation is because the President took the unprecedented step of actually releasing the WAVES records on a rolling basis.\xc2\xa0 So that is a pretty good indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency on this and a range of other issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if you consult those WAVES records and look at the records that apply to the times in which Mr. Schulman was cleared into the White House, it indicates that he was cleared into the White House to attend -- on most of those occasions -- meetings to discuss health care.\xc2\xa0 Now, of course, the Affordable Care Act includes tax credits for small businesses so they can better afford quality health insurance for their employees, and includes tax credits for middle-class families who are trying to afford quality health insurance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good reason why somebody like the commissioner of the IRS, who has an expertise in the tax code, would be involved in discussions about properly implementing tax credits to make it easier for people to afford health insurance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the fact that these meetings occurred is something that we all know about because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency.\xc2\xa0 The topic of those meetings, or at least many of them, is something that we know about because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of those meetings was to ensure the highest-quality implementation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief domestic policy priority, which is expanding access to health care and lowering health care costs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think the background, or the situation here, is pretty evident to any unbiased observer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks this morning about student loan rates -- before he began those remarks, he talked about the economy quite a bit; talked about the auto industry coming back; talked about where the people\xe2\x80\x99s investments might be in terms of how well they\xe2\x80\x99re doing; talked about other economic issues.\xc2\xa0 Was he taking sort of a victory lap there on the economy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what the President was pointing out is that we -- that our recovery is starting to gain some traction.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re digging out of a very deep hole, and our economy is still working to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression, but we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased about the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made so far.\xc2\xa0 But the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe we can take our foot off the gas here; that there are a number of other things that we can do to answer the three questions that I raised earlier -- what can we do to expand economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCertainly, expanding access to a college education for more families is part of that equation -- but so are things like investing in high-quality early childhood education for every child in America.\xc2\xa0 We know there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong \xe2\x80\x9cbang for the buck\xe2\x80\x9d argument, that a relatively small investment in a program like that pays big dividends down the line in terms of academic achievement and other social measures that will put our kids on the path to success in a 21st century economy.\xc2\xa0 There are other things, like investments in infrastructure, that would create jobs right away but also lay the foundation for our long-term economic strengths.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a number of things that the President thinks that we can do to further strengthen our economy.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some work to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the next one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to a question I asked last week.\xc2\xa0 Did the President -- what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about the IRS and the delays and refunds to some of the American public who already filed a while ago?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m actually not aware of any broader delay on IRS refunds.\xc2\xa0 Maybe I missed something.\xc2\xa0 But if you have questions about those delays, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check out the -- to consult with the IRS.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I also want to ask about immigration.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President now on immigration?\xc2\xa0 Is it time for his plan B to surface and come out?\xc2\xa0 He said if there\'s a stalemate on the Hill, after a certain time he is willing to bring out his plan B.\xc2\xa0 Is it time for plan B?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not, April.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re actually encouraged by the progress that\'s been made so far.\xc2\xa0 This is a bipartisan agreement that is moving its way -- making its way through the Senate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I mentioned earlier in reference to a previous question, I think even people in Congress would acknowledge that they would like things to move more quickly through Congress.\xc2\xa0 But this piece of legislation is one of the most complex, wide-ranging pieces of legislation that this Congress has had to deal with in quite some time, probably since the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So it makes sense that they\'re taking a reasoned look at this.\xc2\xa0 But I think given that, it\'s moving pretty expeditiously through the Senate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNot everybody -- there\'s nobody who is looking at this piece of legislation and says, this is exactly the way I would have written it word for word.\xc2\xa0 Everybody recognizes that we\'re going to have to compromise here.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\'s plenty of evidence right now to indicate that both sides are compromising.\xc2\xa0 But the President is particularly pleased, because even this compromise, generally speaking, reflects the priorities that he laid out.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re going to continue to be supportive of the process, and we\'ll see what happens in the weeks ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though both sides are compromising, is there really a thought in the White House that this could still happen this year?\xc2\xa0 Even with the compromise, nothing has been made concrete yet.\xc2\xa0 But is there thought that this will happen this year still?\xc2\xa0 Or are you optimistic, or are you just hedging your bets?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'re still counting on it getting done this year.\xc2\xa0 There\'s ample evidence to indicate that it\'s built up a little bit of momentum.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s a compromise.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is getting every single thing that they want.\xc2\xa0 But generally speaking, the President\'s priorities are reflected in that piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 We\'re seeing constructive engagement from Republicans and even some support from Republicans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'re going to continue to work our way through this process.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still a ways from the finish line, but we feel good about the progress that we\'ve made so far, and hopefully we\'ll be able to keep that momentum going.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on Nadya\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 You said no role for Assad even in a transitional, limited basis for a new future for Syria, correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this administration believe currently there is a viable, cohesive transitional government ready to go?\xc2\xa0 Because there\'s ample evidence of discord, disarray, disagreement among those who are broadly defined as the opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt that there are a lot of people with differing views about what the future of Syria should look like.\xc2\xa0 I think there is broad agreement from a lot of people -- not everybody -- but I think most people agree that Assad does need to go.\xc2\xa0 And so brokering that transition is the first step, but setting up a transitional government would be the next one.\xc2\xa0 And we would have to work with all parties.\xc2\xa0 So we\'d work with --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s not one ready to go --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a work in progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you\'d agree?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would acknowledge that what we\'re going to have to do is we\'re going to have to work with even the disparate elements of the opposition.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t all get along; that there are differences of opinion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To put it mildly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They have differences of opinion as well about what the future of that country should look like.\xc2\xa0 But what this administration, and what our allies and partners in the region are committed to, is ensuring that we can broker a political transition in that country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we\'re going to put an end to the violence and that\'s the only way we\'re going to make sure that we have a government in that country that reflects the will of the Syrian people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it a credible policy for this government to say Assad cannot even have a transitional role, there has to be an immediate move to a transitional government that doesn\'t even exist?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You are talking about President Assad who has used weapons of war against his own people to slaughter tens of thousands of innocent people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not in defense of Assad to ask that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 But I\'d be hard pressed to make the case to you that he should have a role in the transitional government.\xc2\xa0 This is a guy who has demonstrated his willingness to slaughter without any conscience innocent people by the thousands.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then what accounts for the inability to put together a transitional government, if that\'s the highest priority?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the highest priority is to get Assad out of power so that he can no longer have his hands on the weapons of war that are being used to slaughter thousands of people.\xc2\xa0 I think that is the highest priority.\xc2\xa0 Another priority is making sure the humanitarian needs of the people who have been displaced by this violence are met.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we\'re mobilizing significant resources on behalf of -- in support of our partners to try to meet that humanitarian need.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also trying to build up the Syrian opposition forces by providing some non-lethal aid so that they have the resources that they need to better fight the regime forces.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a lot of things that are urgent priorities in this situation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what happens in a crisis.\xc2\xa0 But there is no doubt that it is going to take a lot of work.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not just going to be the responsibility of the United States, but the responsibility of other interested partners to try to broker some agreement not just among the -- not just between the Assad regime and the opposition, but also among elements of the opposition.\xc2\xa0 This is hard work.\xc2\xa0 This is not going to be an easy step.\xc2\xa0 But all of these steps are hard.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut this administration is committed to doing it, both because of our concerns about the humanitarian situation there, but also because of the broader, destabilizing impact that this conflict is having throughout the region and the questions that poses for the security of our allies in that region and the security of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then moving to China and the President\'s meeting next week, when Jay addressed the issue of hacking and cybersecurity, it sounded to my ear -- and correct me if I\'m wrong -- that it was kind of a bland assessment.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you in the Pentagon, the idea that hacking into sensitive platforms about our most recent defense systems is not an issue they take blandly.\xc2\xa0 How personally outraged is the President about this?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any sense of emotional reaction to it?\xc2\xa0 And can you say this will be kicked up higher than it would have been, let\'s say, a month ago, on the, I know, understandably, very complex agenda for this summit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that this is something that the President is concerned about.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that we have said publicly, which is that we are concerned about intrusions that are emanating from China.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that this is something that we have raised previously with the Chinese, and it\'s something that the President -- that\'s something that the President will raise in the context of this forum next weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But having raised it and then still seeing the behavior, doesn\'t that provide an extra level of intensity to this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there was a lot of intensity behind it in the first place.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President has identified and that the Pentagon has identified as a national security priority.\xc2\xa0 It also has some consequences for our economy, because we\'ve seen some intrusions on private-sector entities too, including some media organizations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 The President continues to be concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s something that we are going to raise with the Chinese President over the weekend -- next weekend.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also something -- we\'ve established this dialogue, a working group with them, I guess we\'ve called it, that would take a look at some of these issues to try to find ways to address these challenges.\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is something that is a priority of the President\'s because of the significant national security implications involved.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I take you back before the subpoena of phone records of my colleague, James Rosen, and ask you whether his 2009 reporting on North Korea was brought to the attention of the President or his national security advisor?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am not able to answer that question only because it\'s hard for me to assess what article or what television clip the President may or may not have seen back in 2009.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if anyone in the White House national security, such as Tom Donilon, played any role in triggering the leak investigation itself by the Justice Department?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve been pretty clear that these kinds of criminal investigations are the kinds of things that are initiated by the Department of Justice and are not subject to any sort of political or White House influence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that, David Gregory of NBC is reporting that then-Defense Secretary Panetta was so angered by the leak that he called Attorney General Holder at home and said you\'ve got to deal with this.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any knowledge of phone conversations between the Attorney General and the former Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSteve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got four months left of the fiscal year, and while the student loan thing seems to be moving through both chambers, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything going on the sequester.\xc2\xa0 There have been some bipartisan efforts in the Senate -- Mark Udall and Susan Collins have a proposal that would give the White House, the administration, more flexibility in how you implement those cuts.\xc2\xa0 Given that there\'s been no success in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s push of a larger deal at this point, would the White House still rather keep the sequester in place as it is?\xc2\xa0 Or is there any chance the White House would be willing to go along with some kind of blanket flexibility?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that\'s the way I would characterize the administration position.\xc2\xa0 But I think what I would say is simply this -- I haven\'t seen the proposals that have been put forward that you referred to there.\xc2\xa0 What this administration has done is put forward a balanced approach to dealing with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 What it would do is it would turn off the sequester.\xc2\xa0 It would protect important investments in things like education and infrastructure that are so critical to our long-term economic strength.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the kicker -- it would actually do more to reduce the deficit over the long term than the sequester did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to build some bipartisan support behind what the President put forward.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is engaged in a -- the President has been engaged, something that you guys have all closely covered, in conversations with Senate and House Republicans to try to find a caucus of common sense; to try to find some people in Congress who are not just in the Democratic Party, who are willing to consider a balanced approach to dealing with this; that we can make some further cuts in government spending at the same time we\xe2\x80\x99re making -- we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting investments and priorities.\xc2\xa0 We can close some tax loopholes and do some other things with the tax code that would help us to address our deficit challenges in a balanced way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress over that -- in the last couple of years in terms of some of the proposals that have already been signed into law, and I think the CBO report from a couple of weeks ago indicates that we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually made a lot of progress at increasing the rate at which we\xe2\x80\x99re reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 There is more work that needs to be done and the President has put forward a specific plan for doing so that, as I mentioned, would turn off the sequester, would protect our investments in critical things like education and infrastructure, and actually do more to reduce the deficit than the sequester does.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get some Republican support for that and move it through the Congress.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to depend on the willingness of Republicans to adopt what the President sees as a rather common-sense approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a concern by the White House that if you -- if the President and the administration actually had the flexibility to not have the Meals on Wheels be cut, for example, which the White House has been talking about, that that would take the pressure off of these negotiations?\xc2\xa0 That you would essentially own all the particular cuts because you have this flexibility?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a lot of people who have sort of floated this idea about whether or not flexibility is a good thing or a bad thing.\xc2\xa0 We actually think that the sequester is a really bad thing.\xc2\xa0 It has had a bad impact on things like Meals on Wheels and Head Start.\xc2\xa0 We had this kerfuffle over the FAA control tower situation, so there was a significant impact on the ability of the federal government to perform basic functions that the American people rely on, on a regular basis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The sequester is bad policy because it also is inhibiting our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 So Jim was talking about the good economic data that\xe2\x80\x99s come through over the course of the last month or six weeks -- think how much better that economic data might be if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the sequester in place.\xc2\xa0 The CBO estimated that the sequester would actually reduce the growth in -- the economic growth by up to three-quarters of a percentage point [.6%]and take away up to three-quarters of a million jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are some significant consequences for the sequester beyond just some of the inconveniences that some have pointed to.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put forward a very specific plan -- it would turn off the sequester, protect our investments, and actually do more to reduce the deficit than the sequester itself does.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain -- why not make it just a little bit better?\xc2\xa0 Why not just have a little bit more flexibility and then you could have a slightly better outcome?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address what I cited there in terms of the impact that the sequester has on our broader economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is most concerned about, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put forward a very specific plan to fix it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Did the President talk with Rasmussen this morning about Syria at all?\xc2\xa0 Or did he offer any updates from the U.S. point of view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of the meeting that the President did with the Secretary General.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you a readout before the end of the day today, though.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he offer any chemical weapons update?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLaura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last month, two French journalists from Le Monde were in Jobar near Damascus.\xc2\xa0 There was a bombing.\xc2\xa0 Both of them were injured; they went to the hospital.\xc2\xa0 Their eyes were -- they had to be treated and cured with two shots of atropine.\xc2\xa0 Several French doctors, when they came back, said they were injured by sarin gas.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to what appears to be a chemical attack documented by two independent French journalists?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed from this podium, and I think even the President himself has expressed, Laura, that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So we have stated our desire to take a careful look and investigate what exactly is happening in Syria to try to document any evidence of the use of chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the opposition on this effort, and this raises -- and the reason that we are working so hard on this is because the use of chemical weapons does raise some serious concerns.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has talked about that quite extensively as well.\xc2\xa0 So what I can tell you is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports but, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to conducting a pretty rigorous investigation here because this is a serious matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGo ahead, Andrei.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The Turkish press reports this morning read that the Turkish government has arrested a group of suspected extremists tied in with this Jabhat al Nusra group that\xe2\x80\x99s fighting in Syria with the cargo of the sarin gas just referred to.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of this incident, or can you share any information about it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you, Andrei, is I was aware of the reports that Laura was citing but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s just a mix-up in my email or somebody else got those reports.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen them, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on a report that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But can you at least say that you are for getting to the bottom of this?\xc2\xa0 Because some people even say that since this seems to indicate that the chemical weapons were intended for the opposition, that the people who are supporting the opposition will want to suppress this information.\xc2\xa0 So please tell us that you want to go to get to the bottom of this incident.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can unequivocally confirm for you that we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in getting to the bottom of who may or may not -- who may be responsible for the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard senior administration officials express some skepticism about claims that the opposition is responsible for that.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to get to the bottom of this and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in an effort with our partners and with the U.N. to try to figure that out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDave.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, your website says you\xe2\x80\x99re hosting a discussion this afternoon about this asteroid that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be passing fairly close to Earth today.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed about the asteroid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that scientists have concluded that the asteroid poses no threat to Planet Earth.\xc2\xa0 I never really thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be standing up here saying that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I guess I am.\xc2\xa0 So since it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pose a threat to Planet Earth, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it necessitated a briefing to the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any views about spending more resources on what your website calls \xe2\x80\x9chazard mitigation\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to asteroids?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that reference.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President does believe that scientific exploration and that the study of these kinds of asteroids is a worthwhile endeavor.\xc2\xa0 And certainly we\xe2\x80\x99re taking advantage of the opportunity -- maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a spike in interest in the asteroid to facilitate a discussion on matters related to space.\xc2\xa0 So it should be an interesting discussion.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage you to tune in if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any details related to hazard mitigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, though you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to discuss reports about James Comey, can you give us any guidance on whether President Obama is close to making an FBI nomination announcement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, particularly given all of the reporting that\xe2\x80\x99s been out there on this, you might say, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of any timing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the tenure of the current FBI director is coming to an end, but in terms of when a replacement might be nominated, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not able to give you any guidance at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been any outreach to Senator McCain yet by the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check on that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay said there would be on Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99re just curious about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s asking about and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a way for us to provide you an update, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to work on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on student loans, would you expect President Obama to be making more such events on student loans between now and July 1?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific scheduling announcements at this point, but certainly this is an issue that the President has made a priority.\xc2\xa0 I think that was evident from his comments today.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out.\xc2\xa0 I think it will depend on what kind of action and cooperation we see on Capitol Hill to solve this problem before the end of June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who gave the White House assurances about the asteroid, by the way?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding that\xe2\x80\x99s a scientific conclusion that was drawn.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which scientist sketched it out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was NASA involved?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know if NASA was involved in reaching that conclusion, but I have been assured that there is no threat posed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a movie.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hi, Kate.\xc2\xa0 Where are you from?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McClatchy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Nice to meet you, Kate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice to meet you, too.\xc2\xa0 The Senate, though they haven\xe2\x80\x99t put out anything official, they have said that they might have a plan to freeze student loan rates to 3.4 for another two years.\xc2\xa0 Is Obama supportive of this type of measure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this certainly addresses the concerns that I raised at the beginning.\xc2\xa0 So, because of that, it is something we would support.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s different than the proposal that the President has put forward in his budget, but it is something that the President would support because it addresses these other concerns about locking in lower rates, including safeguards for lower-income families.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other critical difference there that I think is also important that I have not yet mentioned is that one of the other things that\xe2\x80\x99s I think troubling about the Republican proposal is that it would use some of the money collected from students, based on their higher interest rates, to pay down the deficit, while at the same time, Republicans are still working to protect tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the difference is, is that Democrats are actually proposing what I think is a much more common-sense approach, which is to close loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected; to protect the lower interest rates that are paid by students.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good longer-term investment and a wise investment.\xc2\xa0 So this is along the lines of something that we could support because it would address the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out here, including this one about deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 This week, some prominent, gay Democratic Party donors publicly expressed discontent with the White House over not issuing that executive order against LGBT workplace discrimination and with Senate Democrats over the exclusion of gay couples from immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 One donor, Jonathan Lewis, said he\xe2\x80\x99s withholding donations to the Democratic Party \xe2\x80\x9cuntil we see our friends\xe2\x80\x99 actions and deeds align with the rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Are these threats from gay Democratic Party donors significant?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the threats, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to react to them.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that what we have said about the immigration compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s moving through the Senate is that it broadly reflects the priorities that the President laid out, but the President is not getting every single thing that he wanted.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the priority that you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified there is one of the things that the President is not getting -- at least at this point, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like he\xe2\x80\x99ll get in this compromise.\xc2\xa0 I do think that there is an amendment process on the Senate floor where this could be considered, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict the outcome at this point.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that this is something that -- this is a compromise piece of legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s moving forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the executive order, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you in terms of any timing or any possible executive order, or whether anything is being drafted or anything else you might ask along those lines.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I do want to put a fine point on that, because in an attempt to allay some of these concerns, DNC Treasurer, Andrew Tobias, said in an email to donors that was leaked to me that Exxon Mobil\xe2\x80\x99s decision on Wednesday to reject a nondiscrimination policy towards LGBT workers may be a hook to push that executive order across the finish line.\xc2\xa0 Does that company\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of a nondiscrimination protection on Wednesday prompt any reconsideration at the White House about that directive?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on the executive order front.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 So the President has expressed that he is currently displeased with the IRS, but I was just wondering if the White House was planning on apologizing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said is that he is troubled by the wrongdoing that apparently occurred at the IRS, and he is committed to making sure that we get to the bottom of what exactly happened and to make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent those kinds of things from happening again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President has put forward a career civil servant, somebody who served in the previous Republican administration and has served this Democratic President -- so somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a partisan affiliation -- to take a close look at this.\xc2\xa0 This is somebody that has all of the authority that he needs to get to the bottom of what exactly happened, and the President expects that those who perpetrated this wrongdoing or authorized this wrongdoing or allowed it to happen will be held accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, in addition to that, the President has also indicated his willingness on behalf of the entire administration to cooperate with legitimate oversight efforts.\xc2\xa0 So I know there\xe2\x80\x99s an appetite in Congress to take a look at what exactly happened, and I think the cooperation that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from us -- well, I would say this:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve actually already seen cooperation from us on this effort in terms of senior administration officials who testified before Congress.\xc2\xa0 And as legitimate oversight efforts move forward, you can anticipate that the administration will cooperate with them.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, finally, you\'ve also -- I\'ve also read that the Department of Justice has announced that they are actually going to conduct a criminal inquiry into this matter.\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously something separate from what the President has put forward -- this is an independent criminal investigation -- and that will also give us some insight possibly into what exactly happened, who should be held accountable, and whether or not there was any criminal wrongdoing.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s an assessment that they\'ll reach on their own.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a lot of people who are taking a careful look at this.\xc2\xa0 It will give us an opportunity to get to the bottom of what exactly happened, and will hopefully allow us to put in some safeguards to make sure that doesn\'t happen again.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'ll take a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Phil.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney -- Governor Romney said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he is going to reemerge in the public debate and kind of comment on some issues.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if the President has any views on his opponent sort of coming out publicly now to talk about issues in the news.\xc2\xa0 And one criticism he had was that the President is campaigning -- and these are his words -- "as if there is another election" when there isn\'t.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m wondering if the President has any reaction to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen those remarks and I haven\'t talked to the President about whether or not he has seen them.\xc2\xa0 There\'s obviously not another election that the President is going to be involved in, or at least on the ballot for.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConnie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 On Mexico, there\'s been at least two Americans now arrested illegally.\xc2\xa0 They finally released a woman last night.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. -- does your administration think it\'s safe for Americans to travel to Mexico?\xc2\xa0 And did you put any pressure on the Mexican government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned in response to Jim\'s question about Syria, it\'s the responsibility of the State Department to issue guidance to Americans who are looking to travel overseas.\xc2\xa0 So I\'d refer you to the Department of State for any advice or concerns that they would have about any sort of foreign travel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did you speak to the Mexican government, put any pressure on them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But if we did, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that was -- it seems likely that that was communicated through the State Department.\xc2\xa0 So they may have some more insight for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any anger at what happened?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are two innocent Americans over the past year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'m not familiar with the details of these cases, so I don\'t want to weigh in at this point.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo last one in the back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on China.\xc2\xa0 Jay just mentioned the other day, other than cybersecurity, stability in Asia would be the certain topic to be discussed.\xc2\xa0 So could you elaborate a little bit on the meaning of stability in China -- in Asia?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean South China Sea and also -- the sea dispute?\xc2\xa0 And also, on the coming trip by China\'s President Xi to Latin America, we know President Obama -- and also Vice President Joe Biden right now is in Latin America.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House view President Xi\'s visit to Latin America?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to have to get back to you in terms of a reaction to President Xi\'s visit to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of the details of that trip.\xc2\xa0 But if we have reaction, we can get one for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the broader relationship between the U.S. and China and the impact that has on stability in Asia, I think Jay has talked quite a bit about the nature of our relationship with China, that there are some elements of cooperation and some elements of competition.\xc2\xa0 And it is the desire of the United States to try to expand the areas of cooperation, whether it\'s dealing with the threat posed by the North Korean regime or dealing with some of the strife that\'s in place in Iran and Syria, that there\'s a role for China to play as a global economic -- as a global power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we certainly would hope that we could cooperate with them on that, and there are some areas where we have successfully.\xc2\xa0 Also ongoing in Asia -- Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions of the world economically, so there are significant stakes in the outcome of some disagreements in Asia.\xc2\xa0 And it is the desire of the United States to play a constructive role in resolving some of those disagreements.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we have tried to do.\xc2\xa0 And I think that would be an example of where we might be able to take an area that could be perceived as competition and try to turn it into an area of cooperation between our two countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I\'m sure this is something that President Obama and President Xi will have ample opportunity to discuss next weekend.\xc2\xa0 And I know that we\'re going to put in place -- we\'ll have some senior officials that will be available to do our best to try to give you a sense of how those conversations go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I\'m going to wrap it up here, but I\'m going to read the week ahead.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President and the Vice President will host a National Conference on Mental Health at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The conference will bring together people from across the country -- including representatives from state and local government, mental health advocates, educators, health care providers, faith leaders, and individuals who have struggled with mental health problems -- to discuss how we can all work together to reduce stigma and help the millions of Americans struggling with mental health problems recognize the importance of reaching out for assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will host President Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Pi\xc3\xb1era of Chile at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing a broad range of bilateral, regional, and global issues during their Oval Office meeting, including our joint work in advancing negotiations toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 The President also welcomes the opportunity to underscore the strong bonds of friendship between the United States and Chile, and discuss our cooperation on energy, education, environmental conservation, and economic development in Latin America.\xc2\xa0 I know the President was pleased with the very warm reception that he had when he visited Chile a couple of years ago, so I know that he looks forward to offering President Pi\xc3\xb1era a similarly warm welcome here in the U.S.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday, for all you football fans out there, the President will welcome the Super Bowl Champion Baltimore Ravens to the White House to honor the team and their Super Bowl victory.\xc2\xa0 This visit will also continue the tradition started by the President of honoring sports teams for their efforts to give back to communities as part of their trip to Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will travel to the Charlotte area as part of his middle-class jobs and opportunity tour.\xc2\xa0 From there, he\'ll travel to San Jos\xc3\xa9, California to attend an event for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll spend the night in San Jos\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would point out that that trip to Charlotte will be similar to some of the events that we\'ve done in the last couple of weeks to highlight the President\'s commitment to expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So the President has taking trips to Austin and Baltimore over the last couple of weeks where he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about some of these issues, and so he\'ll do that for a third time in the Charlotte area.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Friday, the President will wake up in San Jos\xc3\xa9 and then travel to Los Angeles, California to attend an event for the Democratic National Committee.\xc2\xa0 He will then travel to Palm Springs, California to meet with President Xi Jinping of The People\'s Republic of China at Sunnylands, the Walter and Leonore Annenberg estate.\xc2\xa0 He will remain overnight in Palm Springs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Saturday, the President will wrap up his meetings with the Chinese President and then will return to Washington, D.C.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate a press conference?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'re still working through the logistics of the press setup with our Chinese counterparts.\xc2\xa0 But we are working to try to make sure that there\'s an opportunity for the Presidents to take a question or two.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re still working on the details of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\'s intended to be an informal gathering, as has been widely reported, so I would not anticipate a formal news conference.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re looking to see if we can set up a situation where we could get a question or two in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that because of pressure from the Chinese?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s because of logistics of the event.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:47 P.M.
