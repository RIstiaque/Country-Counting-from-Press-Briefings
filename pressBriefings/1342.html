BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for making the flight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a short one, so I wanted to get back here early, so sorry to get between you and the food.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To start, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a readout for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with General Odierno, which he made -- which he had before we left.\xc2\xa0 The President met today with General Odierno to review security and political progress in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 General Odierno provided a positive assessment of the current security conditions and the ongoing transition of responsibilities to Iraqi security forces ahead of the change of mission of U.S. forces at the end of August.\xc2\xa0 The President and General Odierno also discussed the encouraging step taken by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s federal supreme court to certify election results, as well as U.S. support for an inclusive government formation process.\xc2\xa0 The President thanked General Odierno for his service to the nation.</p>\n<p>And with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be released in a statement form and email form?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It will be transcribed by some of the best professionals in the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Israeli-Gaza situation, Abbas said that when he comes here next week he\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask the President to take bold action.\xc2\xa0 Any indication about what he means?\xc2\xa0 And is the President prepared to take bold action on the Israeli-Palestinian situation?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important that we move in the process to find stability and security in that region.\xc2\xa0 In terms of this incident, what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to the President is that events like the one that transpired a couple nights ago don\xe2\x80\x99t transpire again, that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting the security of Israel, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting aid to the folks who need it in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he spoke with the Turkish Prime Minister, did the Prime Minister specifically ask him to condemn the Israeli forces\xe2\x80\x99 actions?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the call, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you check on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the oil spill, can you talk a little bit about --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one quick second.\xc2\xa0 But just on that point, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily read out something that the Prime Minister of Turkey had to say.\xc2\xa0 That would be up to their government to read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the oil spill, can you talk a little bit about why Holder was sent to the region and why this probe was launched yesterday, about the timing of this and --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of timing, I would direct you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 But what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is checking out what laws were broken and what possible steps need to be taken in order to make sure that the law is upheld, and if people broke the law, that they\xe2\x80\x99re treated accordingly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it important as part of this for sort of the public to know that, as a part of your message to the public that the White House is on top of this and is going to be holding them accountable?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, when the Justice Department is checking out to see if laws are broken, they\xe2\x80\x99re just checking out to see if laws were broken.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re doing their function in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s important for the Justice Department to be doing and we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be hearing from them soon on what they\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to the Japanese Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s resignation?\xc2\xa0 And what does this mean for stability in the region?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Japan is one of our best friends in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that alliance is not going to change as a result of any change in leadership in that country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll watch the political process take its course and be waiting like everybody else to see who the next Prime Minister will be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, last Friday in the Gulf, the President said he\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately responsible for the crisis and that the buck stops here.\xc2\xa0 Having cancelled a trip to Indonesia prior -- the first time because of what happened on the health care vote, would it not make sense to do it again as this disaster continues to unfold in the Gulf?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of reasons to take the trip.\xc2\xa0 And regardless of any discussions that might have been had on that, as it stands the trip is still on schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is under discussion whether to postpone?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I said regardless of any discussions that might have been had, it still is on the schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It means that it\xe2\x80\x99s still on the schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- so there have been discussions about taking it off the schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t be responsible for every conversation that happens inside the White House, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say definitively who\xe2\x80\x99s talked to who about what.\xc2\xa0 But the bottom line is that it\xe2\x80\x99s still on the schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, can you go back to the Gaza flotilla for just a moment?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. in conversations with the Israelis about what happens the next time an aid ship tries to pass through the blockade and are there measures in place to prevent a similar incident from happening again?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with Israel, but I will say it\xe2\x80\x99s important to the President and to our country that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see the same kind of events unfold like they did the last time.\xc2\xa0 So we are talking to our partners and are hopeful that we won\'t see a repeat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel confident then that they\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a shared sentiment that something like this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He feels confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re having productive conversations with them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also the flotilla report, the inquiry that\'s going on, the fact-finding effort, what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of that?\xc2\xa0 Do you know when that report might come back?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timeline on when that report will come out, but like we said yesterday, the President supports a credible investigation into what happened here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On talking to your partners, has the President spoken to the Israeli leadership since he spoke to them on that day -- I think Monday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s, of course, conversations that happen at different levels in the government.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure as to whether or not the President himself has spoken to folks in Israel.\xc2\xa0 I can check on that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on this trip, can you tell us who\xe2\x80\x99s along with the President and who he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be meeting there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think in your background guidance you have the list of folks who are going to be there.\xc2\xa0 But it includes -- Senator Specter is on the plane.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Ohlenmeyer will be there.\xc2\xa0 I know the mayor will be there.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have that list right in front of me right now, but I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that it was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was an invitation extended to Congressman Sestak on this trip, and is he here?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I had a conversation with Laura about this earlier -- there was a little confusion.\xc2\xa0 He was invited to a political meeting before the speech with some other community leaders from around the state and was certainly welcome to stay for the speech if he was so inclined.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not on the plane?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Apparently he has a previous engagement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not coming to any part of the event today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you making a distinction between invited to the political meeting and invited to the speech?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting at the location of the speech --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was just trying to help you square the circle on why there might have been a disconnect on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I see, okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he have sat in the same area with the President, with Senator Specter, for example?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the audience and how it\xe2\x80\x99s set up, I don\'t know for sure, but it would be pretty obvious where all the political leaders would have sat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is the audience for this?\xc2\xa0 Is there some kind -- I don\'t know, is there a conference going on, or who is the group the President is speaking to?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 This is in Finkenbinder\xe2\x80\x99s pocket.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it for you in a minute.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was not invited to come on the plane?\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I was clear on that.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t believe so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report out of the U.N. Human Rights and they\'re talking about making recommendations for countries to have to disclose when they use unmanned drones, in particular, to kill terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the U.S. would support?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on making sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing everything in his power to protect the security of our country and to advance our strategic interests.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into an intelligence matter, but I will tell you that the President is going to continue to do everything that he can to protect Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the surface, that recommendation wouldn\'t present any problems for the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into intelligence matters.</p>\n<p>Okay, the audience is about 300 people; 50 percent of the tickets went to the school and then the White House distributed the rest.\xc2\xa0 The audience will be comprised of students, faculty, elected officials and local community and business leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the oil spill for just a second.\xc2\xa0 The inquiry that the DOJ is conducting, the target of that could be oil company executives, workers?\xc2\xa0 Could it be regulators?\xc2\xa0 Are there -- can you say anything about that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would direct you to the Department of Justice for the parameters of what they\'re looking into.\xc2\xa0 I think the bottom line is they\'re looking to see if any laws were broken.\xc2\xa0 If there were, they\'re going to act appropriately.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, they wouldn\'t rule out the possibility that regulators may be implicated here?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to those guys about the scope.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also could you go back to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 Does this have any implications for the Japanese-U.S. alliance?\xc2\xa0 I mean, apparently the Okinawa base was an issue in the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, our alliance is unshaken.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the base, as their chief minister said this morning, that agreement will be honored.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try on the economy and Europe.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been reports that the Obama administration is urging its European partners to conduct similar bank stress tests as the U.S. did.\xc2\xa0 What would the White House say about that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Well, the United States is confident that European leaders have been doing the right thing by putting in place reforms that help to keep their financial institutions strong and help to shore up their own economies.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\'m going to get into the specifics of private conversations that are had between our nation and other nations, but if you want more on that, I would direct you to the Treasury.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not to belabor the Sestak thing, but you said he was invited to a political meeting prior to the speech?\xc2\xa0 What kind of political meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of meeting the President has at a lot of these events with local community leaders, often from different parts of the state.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This happens behind closed doors?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something we\'re going to see?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Sestak declined that invitation, as far as you know?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that Mark Kirk misled people about his service record?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is something I haven\'t talked to him about.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure if he\xe2\x80\x99s even seen the reports about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not sure he\xe2\x80\x99s what?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 -- he\xe2\x80\x99s even seen the reports about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he following the Illinois Senate race?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He is following it, but probably not as closely as those of us who have a lot more time to just read the political news from around the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Sestak thing for one second.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that part of it -- the campaign is not the reason that he\xe2\x80\x99s not here, it\xe2\x80\x99s because he had a prior commitment.\xc2\xa0 But do you think that part of this may be lingering tension between the White House and the Sestak campaign, given the obvious?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Nope.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you elaborate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Really, no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s eat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:11 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
