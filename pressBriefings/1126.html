EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll get started with questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The Libya report that the administration sent to the Hill yesterday seems to have only increased some of the anger and criticism among members of Congress, and Speaker Boehner says he still wants an additional legal rationale for the U.S. involvement in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Are you planning on sending him anything by tomorrow, as he\xe2\x80\x99s asked, or are you satisfied with the response in the report?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we have from the beginning consulted regularly with Congress -- more than 40 times, and 41 at least if you add yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s substantial report that we provided to Congress, which included our legal reasoning with regards to the War Powers resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate further elucidation of our legal reasoning, because I think it was quite clear.\xc2\xa0 And I can go through that with you if you like.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think -- and let me just say that we absolutely respect Congress\xe2\x80\x99s interest in this issue and desire for consultation and answers to their questions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have been so responsive, including with the substantial report that we provided yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s noteworthy that the views expressed in the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s letter stand in contrast to the views he expressed in 1999 when he called the War Powers Act \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d and warned Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cresist the temptation to take any action that would do further damage to the institution of the presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I make an observation about that because I think it is worth noting in the current context.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think Speaker Boehner is playing politics now by --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I simply think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know what his views were then.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s important about that, too, is that this was 1999 and he was -- he had concerns about the actions that then President Clinton was taking in the Balkans, and yet despite those concerns, urged Congress to resist invoking the War Powers resolution because of the potential damage it could do to the institution of the presidency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that the context here is worth noting, that is all.\xc2\xa0 And I think that our legal reasoning, which we provided to Congress, is quite complete and stands alone and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need any addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just switch to Afghanistan quickly, do you have any update for us on whether the President has met with General Petraeus or plans to do so today or tomorrow on the Afghan withdrawal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, thanks for the question.\xc2\xa0 General Petraeus was here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The President met with his national security team, including General Petraeus, to discuss Afghanistan, to review the broad array of issues surrounding the drawdown that will begin in July of 2011, next month.\xc2\xa0 And he will consult further with his national security team and, of course, including General Petraeus in the days coming forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the General provide his recommendations for options for that drawdown?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They discussed a range of options, as I think the General has said in the past publicly, that this was a question of options plural and not option.\xc2\xa0 And that conversation will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Caren.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow on Petraeus.\xc2\xa0 When does the President hope to make a decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will cite the President, who said \xe2\x80\x9csoon,\xe2\x80\x9d so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get more specific than \xe2\x80\x9csoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Obviously the operative date here is July of 2011, so since the policy that he began to implement in December of 2009 envisions and calls for the beginning of the drawdown of this surge force in July of 2011, obviously it will be in time for that to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the process from here?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a series of meetings or is he just going to reflect on what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s step back a little bit.\xc2\xa0 He meets regularly with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan, for important reasons, including the presence of 100,000 U.S. military personnel, is frequently on the agenda when he meets with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 So these are conversations that occur with some regularity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He -- in answer to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question, he did meet with his team yesterday, including General Petraeus.\xc2\xa0 Those meetings will continue.\xc2\xa0 There is no process that is similar to the one that the President undertook in the fall of December of 2009 to do a deep dive and review of our strategy in Afghanistan because that process was designed to produce the policy and the strategy that the President forged and announced in December of 2009 and that he has been implementing ever since, he and the team have been implementing ever since.\xc2\xa0 This is -- this discussion, these meetings, and the result, which will come with his announcement, are part of that implementation process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting gears, how worried is the White House about the Greek crisis and what its implications might be for the American economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have said that the -- we obviously are monitoring this regularly.\xc2\xa0 We consider it a headwind, if you will, in terms of the global economy, and therefore the domestic economy.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the situation and developments in Greece closely.\xc2\xa0 And we are in regular communication with our European counterparts.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that they have the capacity to deal with this, and we believe it is completely within their capacity to do that, and that they will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So far, Greece has made significant progress in terms of reforms.\xc2\xa0 But it is important that the Greek government carry on with the fiscal measures and reforms that are frequently under discussion with the EU and the IMF.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Congressman Anthony Weiner is expected to resign in the next half hour or so.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that this closes the chapter?\xc2\xa0 Does it allow you to focus back on jobs, et cetera?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we never stopped focusing on jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think when the President was asked about this he made clear that -- he expressed his opinion, but he also made clear that this is not an issue that he has been focused on because he has obviously much more significant priorities.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything to add to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to him in recent days? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And can you -- yesterday, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC Chairwoman, said that Democrats now own the economy.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We all own the economy.\xc2\xa0 We all work together in Washington to devise policies to improve the economic situation.\xc2\xa0 I think what the Congresswoman was referring to is the fact that the turnaround that we have seen, the turn -- the change in direction reflected in the fact that when the President was sworn into office we were losing 700,000 jobs a month, and for the last just six months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gained a million jobs; in the, I think, 17 months, or 15 months, it\xe2\x80\x99s been 2.1 million -- reflects a change in direction for the better.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we were contracting severely as an economy by something like 6.4 percent when he took office has been reversed, and that we have grown for seven straight quarters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that the actions that we took in early 2009 -- some of them controversial, some of them very difficult -- have been responsible, or have certainly helped produce that change in direction.\xc2\xa0 A change in direction does not mean an arrival at a destination.\xc2\xa0 We are not where we want to be in terms of the economy, in terms of job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is so focused, why he spent so much of his time devoted to discussing the economy with his advisors, talking to outside folks about their ideas, including his Jobs and Competitiveness Council; CEOs and other leaders in the economy for their ideas about what we need to do to continue to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the six years since President Obama came to Washington, including his Senate career, there have been any number of politicians who have undergone scandal.\xc2\xa0 I can only recall President Obama saying or suggesting that someone should resign or that if he were that person he would resign with Congressman Anthony Weiner, who as far as I can tell has not actually committed any law-breaking as far as has been disclosed as of yet.\xc2\xa0 Why would President Obama choose to speak out on this issue and not, say, Congressman Rangel or Senator Vitter?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I can make the comparison for you.\xc2\xa0 He was asked about it; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here and announce it or anything.\xc2\xa0 He was not looking to comment on this situation.\xc2\xa0 As he made clear in the follow-up question that was asked by Ann Curry in that interview, this is not something he has had the luxury to focus on.\xc2\xa0 He has been focused on other issues -- the economy, jobs, national security, Afghanistan, et cetera.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, I think he made clear that he agreed with Congressman Weiner that the behavior he exhibited was inappropriate, that he had embarrassed himself and obviously his family, and asked the question, he responded.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was looking to make a particular point beyond that -- simply responding to the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how does he feel about Senator Vitter and Congressman Rangel\xe2\x80\x99s behavior?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed it with him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In recent weeks, Republicans have been attacking President Obama for, in their view, seeming to be out of touch with the economic woes of Americans, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Mitt Romney issuing a video featuring unemployed Americans saying they\xe2\x80\x99re not speed bumps; Senator Mitch McConnell of the floor of the Senate yesterday suggested that President Obama was joking about the stimulus not working in that Jobs and Competitive Council event in North Carolina, when he talked about shovel-ready is not as shovel-ready as they had anticipated.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any response?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any response to this charge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s patently obvious that the President is focused on the economy; that he takes enormously seriously the hardship that Americans continue to endure as we emerge from the worst recession most of us have ever seen in our lifetimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons why he asked his office to cull 10 letters a day for him from the 40,000 that are received by this White House, addressed to him every day, is because he wanted to, in their own words, read about the travails that some Americans are going through.\xc2\xa0 And especially if you -- he initiated this practice back in the early part of his administration when we were in an economic freefall. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously that hardship continues.\xc2\xa0 The President feels that very keenly.\xc2\xa0 It is why, again, it is the primary focus of his administration, the primary focus of his waking hours, what he can do, what we can do as an administration, what we can do as Americans, as Republicans and Democrats together, to continue to grow the economy, continue the positive progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and most importantly continue to create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the ABC News/Washington Post poll last week.\xc2\xa0 President Obama was under 50 percent for the first time I can remember when voters were asked whether or not he understands the problems of people like them.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned at all that the President is conveying the opposite of what you just said?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what he does every day is focus on his job and what he can to do to help the American people.\xc2\xa0 Polls say a lot of different things.\xc2\xa0 I think that the reality is that when you are worried about losing your job or you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost your job, or you worry about losing your house or your mortgage is underwater, that anxiety is real and understandable and it affects how you view your own prospects, it affects how you view the overall economy, and it affects how you view your leaders in Washington -- and understandably.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What this President believes is that he came here for a reason, which was to help America, to help change the direction of the country and help, specifically, given the circumstances, the dire circumstances that were here when he took office, to reverse a catastrophic economic collapse that was unfolding as he moved in.\xc2\xa0 That work continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have changed direction.\xc2\xa0 We are growing.\xc2\xa0 The economy is growing; it is no longer shrinking.\xc2\xa0 We are creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve created more than 2.1 private sector -- 2.1 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 But that work continues.\xc2\xa0 This recession caused the loss of 8 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 Eight million Americans lost their jobs in this recession.\xc2\xa0 That is a deep hole.\xc2\xa0 And there is no other task that he has been more dedicated to since he took office than to digging us out of that hole -- or climbing out of that hole. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the work continues.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he says we\xe2\x80\x99re not done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to make the right decisions -- as we get our deficits under control, as we address our long-term debt, but that do we do these things, these important things, in ways that further our potential for economic growth, increase our potential to create jobs, and do not in any way reverse the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if I could just ask you to respond to -- specifically to Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today on Libya, where he said we\xe2\x80\x99re spending $10 million a day, we\xe2\x80\x99re part of an effort to drop bombs on Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s compounds -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass the straight face test, in my opinion, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not in the midst of hostilities.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you have the 30-plus pages that we provided to Congress --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s only one paragraph on that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial amount of material there in answer to all the specific questions that Congress had asked -- members of Congress had asked.\xc2\xa0 And on the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but on the issue of the War Powers resolution there\xe2\x80\x99s one paragraph.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we simply disagree.\xc2\xa0 And we think that -- U.S. forces are playing a constrained supporting role in a multinational coalition whose operations are both legitimized by and limited to the terms of a U.N. Security Council resolution. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we made clear yesterday, we believe U.S. forces are not engaged in the kind of hostilities envisaged by the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 U.S. operations do not involve a number of elements traditionally associated with hostilities, including sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces; the presence of U.S. ground troops -- let me reiterate -- not a single U.S. ground troop in Libya now or ever.\xc2\xa0 U.S. casualties also lack -- U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof, or any significant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our conclusion, therefore, that these constrained and limited operations do not amount to hostilities under the War Powers resolution is consistent with War Powers resolution interpretations put forward by administrations of both political parties dating back to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s 1973 enactment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that that is a comprehensive and thorough legal analysis.\xc2\xa0 Obviously as a lawyer yourself, Chip, you know that there is a long history of legal debate about the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 We do not expect every person to agree with this.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it is accurate and sound legal analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President personally involved in formulating what you just read?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He worked with Bob Bauer --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that he certainly -- it is his position and he worked with White House Counsel and his team and, as a constitutional lawyer himself, he is obviously -- he owns this document.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was his decision ultimately --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and not Bob Bauer\xe2\x80\x99s decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boehner has also called on the President to speak to the American people.\xc2\xa0 Any consideration being given to a speech on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate too far into the future, but there are no plans to give a speech on Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on power of the purse, Boehner suggested that ultimately their option may be power of the purse.\xc2\xa0 Concern that Congress could cut off funding for the Libyan --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful for Congress to send mixed messages, because I think we all agree, the vast majority of the members of Congress, as well as this administration, this President, that the mission undertaken by this broad coalition by NATO and other allies to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 has been important, it has protected Libyan civilians, it has saved thousands of lives, and it has helped create space for the Libyan opposition to organize itself, and it has helped put pressure on Qaddafi to see the writing on the wall and to ultimately step away from power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think those are -- that success is something that members of Congress, even those who have concern, would acknowledge.\xc2\xa0 And the importance of continuing that mission is, I think, something that a majority of Congress supports.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, yesterday you were asked if the President personally believes the War Powers resolution is constitutional, and you said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say because you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about this, but let me just make clear what we are not saying.\xc2\xa0 First of all, what we are saying is that this -- our current actions in Libya or in this mission do not fall under the War Powers resolution because they do not meet the threshold of hostilities as envisioned by the War Powers resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What this reasoning is not saying is that -- is not addressing the constitutionality of the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- it is a very -- it is a limited assessment based on what we are doing in Libya and how it relates to the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 It is not an overall analysis, the likes of which we have seen much of over the past many years since the resolution became law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, the attorneys advising the executive branch, did they all agree that this was within the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was a robust debate, as you might expect in this situation, and that led the President to his view that the War Power resolution\xe2\x80\x99s 60-day termination provision did not apply here.\xc2\xa0 But again, going back to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, this resolution has been -- it would be impossible to have a discussion about the War Powers resolution in a room of lawyers and not have it be a robust debate, because it is a highly debated and debatable resolution.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s surprising at all.\xc2\xa0 I hope that answers your question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the definition of hostilities, if a foreign country were to be lobbing missiles at, say, New York City, is that hostility?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I will address the issue here in terms of how it relates to our participation in a multinational coalition in Libya, how our extremely circumscribed and limited role in that coalition and the activities that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- not just because I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but partly because I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in that kind of speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick other one.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to Zawahiri taking the lead of al Qaeda?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly not surprising.\xc2\xa0 He was identified prior to the successful mission against Osama bin Laden as al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s number two.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s neither surprising nor does it change some fundamental facts, which is al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s ideology is bankrupt.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that peaceful movements for change are the future of the region and al Qaeda is the past.\xc2\xa0 That was true before Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s death and is true today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any plans to send him a congratulatory drone or bunker buster?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no comment on that.\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not elucidating any further, as you put it, on the Libya --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did you say elucidating or hallucinating?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Depends on -- is this Friday?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not elucidating any longer -- your words.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially aware of the political and legislative dynamic on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essentially, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, John Boehner, if you want to put a resolution on the floor, you can go ahead and do it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going anywhere in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re through talking about it.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer as I did to Julie, which is that we will continue to consult with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to answer Congress\xe2\x80\x99s questions as we participate in this mission.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made our legal reasoning clear.\xc2\xa0 We can restate it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate further legal analysis on this issue from us.\xc2\xa0 But I do anticipate continued consultations with Congress about the mission.\xc2\xa0 And stepping back to something I haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned today, which is that we obviously do support a resolution similar to or exactly like the one tabled by -- put forward by Senators Kerry and McCain and others -- a bipartisan resolution that we would support and agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, yesterday on the debt talk, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t specifically endorse the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s deadline -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s July 1st or 4th -- to have something concrete put forward.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree that that is a viable deadline?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the Vice President is leading these talks; what he says represents where we are on these talks.\xc2\xa0 So I have no -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not disagreeing with anything he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not specifically endorsing it, either --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I endorse what the Vice President said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, great.\xc2\xa0 And finally, yesterday at the congressional picnic, the pool cameras caught a -- some video of the Speaker, well known to be a smoker; I believe he prefers Camels.\xc2\xa0 The President, I assume --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we oppose the full repeal of that subsidy, but as you know, we are focused and have been focused on a broad strategy including increasing domestic development of oil and gas but also aggressive development of alternative fuels including biofuels, and also improving our efficiency, our fuel efficiency.\xc2\xa0 And as part of our overall strategy, we would like to see reform that would reduce costs in terms of the subsidy in question here, but not -- we were not -- we did not support the full repeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Knoller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what the venue is for the Saturday golf game?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We discussed a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve known Speaker Boehner for a long time since I covered Congress in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s.\xc2\xa0 I consider him a friend and had an enjoyable conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the legal arguments in the Libya document yesterday, are those the same legal arguments that Justice will use in answering the lawsuit filed yesterday by members of Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prescribe how lawyers might -- actions they might take, but I certainly think the legal reasoning we put forward yesterday, the analysis we put forward yesterday, would be a foundation for a response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Caren\xe2\x80\x99s question, is the President receiving any special briefings on the Greek debt crisis right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can -- I do have something on that.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President called for a reorganization of the government in his State of the Union address because he believes that government should be retooled to meet the needs of the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 This set of recommendations is part of an overall effort to streamline government, cut waste and duplication, increase effectiveness so that we can create a system that will help Americans and businesses compete.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The analysis, options, and recommendations were submitted to the President by Jeff Zients and Lisa Brown on June 9th, as directed.\xc2\xa0 The President will review the recommendations submitted to him over the summer and discuss them with his team.\xc2\xa0 And when he completes his review I expect he will make a public statement about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the review isn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to be completed until the fall?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate more meetings.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement yet to make on when those meetings will take place, but we continue to look to intensify the process as -- deliberately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been unspecific about the progress that has been made, but consistent in describing what has transpired as progress -- and not just us, but other participants -- and we continue to believe that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress in those negotiations and are optimistic about the prospect of an agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Petreaus meeting.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the rationale for waiting a day to acknowledge that and the fact that there were National Security Council --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The meeting happened after the briefing.\xc2\xa0 I was asked yesterday; it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you seem to repeatedly stress that this is not part of a wholesale reevaluation of strategy.\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to purposely, like, downplay this whole notion that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to give a big announcement, big speech coming?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 But what I think happened is that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just simply saying, because people -- most folks here reported on that rather unique and unprecedented process that the President oversaw and initiated -- initiated and oversaw back in the fall of 2009.\xc2\xa0 And I simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t want people to expect a repeat of that unique and unprecedented -- that\xe2\x80\x99s probably redundant -- but unprecedented process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to downplay it.\xc2\xa0 We think it is very significant that he is doing what he said he would do to some degree of skepticism back when he announced this policy.\xc2\xa0 Remember, the inclusion of the July 2011 date as the beginning of a drawdown of those surge forces that he was sending into Afghanistan was viewed by some, in some quarters, as not serious.\xc2\xa0 It was deadly serious. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is doing, as he tends to do, exactly what he said he would do.\xc2\xa0 And he is implementing the policy and the strategy that he put in place in December of 2009.\xc2\xa0 That strategy has met with some significant success, and he is reviewing the situation and will make an announcement relatively soon, as he said, about the pace and slope of the drawdown that will begin next month.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask again because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked several times already today.\xc2\xa0 Is the President still intending to have some sort of formal speech to present the particulars of the immediate drawdown and the early stages of the plan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when you say, \xe2\x80\x9cstill\xe2\x80\x9d intends to, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever suggested that he would make a formal speech.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet on the venue or the format by which he will make the announcement, but he will address it in his own words, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident of that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement about venue or form.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Petraeus meeting on the schedule?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not every meeting the President has is on his public schedule, as you might expect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Normally, though, something like that is on his schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not all of them.\xc2\xa0 But I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your routine National Security Council meetings in the Sit Room typically are on the schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The monthly meetings are.\xc2\xa0 The weekly meetings with Secretary Gates, Secretary Clinton are, but not all the meetings he has are.\xc2\xa0 This was not a -- this was an additional meeting to the routine meetings.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t put it on the schedule, but when asked, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the fact that he did have this meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Libya, what happens now?\xc2\xa0 You say the President disagrees with Congress.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner says he wants an answer tomorrow on whether the Office of Legal Counsel agrees with this assessment of the President.\xc2\xa0 You say you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give any more legal assessment to Congress.\xc2\xa0 What happens in a deadlock like that?\xc2\xa0 Who wins?\xc2\xa0 Does the President win?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the important thing here is not about who wins in terms of partisan politics, Ann.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about does the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, who wins on policy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are continuing with the mission and our participation in it.\xc2\xa0 We continue to consult with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We continue to answer questions when they have them.\xc2\xa0 We have provided the legal analysis that was sent yesterday to Congress.\xc2\xa0 And the process moves forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think as I answered in response to a question from Mike, we would support and endorse the -- a vote on the resolution put forward by -- the bipartisan resolution put forward by Senators McCain and Kerry and others.\xc2\xa0 And so we continue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the important thing is that we understand what is happening in Libya, the tremendous progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, the fact that the President has done exactly what he said he would do -- again, to some degree of skepticism evinced by the very people I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at now -- that he would do what he said he would do, which is have the United States military take the lead in this operation in the initial days because of our unique capabilities, and then within days and not weeks the U.S. would step back and other partners would take the lead in this mission.\xc2\xa0 That is what happened, and it has been true ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said that there would not be U.S. ground forces in Libya.\xc2\xa0 He meant what he said.\xc2\xa0 And he has said that our mission there is described by and limited by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.\xc2\xa0 And he meant what he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this mission continues and it continues to be successful.\xc2\xa0 It saved thousands of lives, prevented what was likely to be a massacre in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 It has given time and space to the opposition to organize -- an opposition that we have worked increasingly closely with as we have gotten to know it and dealt with it.\xc2\xa0 We have worked hard to free up funds that have been frozen that -- Qaddafi regime funds so that the opposition can use those funds for assistance.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the Libyan people will have the opportunity to decide their future, their political future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on current military policy, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t budge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t improve upon the substantial report that we sent to Congress yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing with our supporting role in that mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Abby.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Putting aside the legal justification for just a second, the report says that the mission has current -- has cost about $700 million up until this point.\xc2\xa0 It projects that by September it will be $1.1 billion.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money in the context of the budget cutting and trimming of programs that already exist.\xc2\xa0 How do you justify that to the American people, and when do you expect the money to stop flowing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has justified it clearly in terms of why it is in the interests of the United States to participate in this mission in the form that he has our forces participating in it.\xc2\xa0 It is also important to note that the money that you mention is coming from existing funds.\xc2\xa0 There is no request for a supplemental.\xc2\xa0 And it is money that would have been spent on other things like training missions that are being fulfilled by the actual missions being performed.\xc2\xa0 So this is not new money.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that it continues to be in the U.S. interest to participate in this mission in the limited manner that we are participating in it because it is in our interest, within this multinational coalition, to continue to protect Libyan civilians, to continue to enforce the no-fly zone and an arms embargo to give the opposition the time and space that it needs to organize.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the expectation going to be that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be operating in the same capacity until September?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict the future, so it obviously -- a lot depends on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But NATO recently I think in the last couple of weeks extended its mission for 90 days -- is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Ninety days.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we are participants in that mission.\xc2\xa0 But to anticipate what Libya will look like in September is something I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the cost something that President Obama is considering when he\xe2\x80\x99s making decisions about how involved --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that President Obama made the decision about the level of our participation based on a number of factors regarding our -- serving the American people\xe2\x80\x99s best interests and our best national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that is certainly factually true is that the limited nature of our participation has reduced the cost of it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More importantly, in terms of its success, the multinational nature of the mission has ensured that this has not been something that the United States owns; that it is a broad coalition, including Arab partners, that are responsible for this, that decided collectively to take this action.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that doing it in that way enhances the prospects of a positive outcome for Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions, one on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Last week the Labor Department came out with a report on the black labor force in the recovery, and the Secretary -- Labor Secretary said the President and the Vice President did see this report.\xc2\xa0 What next?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the next step as the black labor force has been hurting for decades in this country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No question.\xc2\xa0 And this is a matter of significant concern to this administration, as is the overall situation with employment.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment is too high.\xc2\xa0 We are working every day to bring it down, to make sure that Americans who are looking for jobs -- minorities and non-minorities who are looking for jobs -- can find them.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- there is no higher priority here.\xc2\xa0 And we are working hard to address overall our economic growth and our job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on the other question, on the War Powers Act -- the President wants to keep calm waters between the branches.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just have a conversation and just say, look, this is what we\xe2\x80\x99re intending?\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he do that to Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has consulted with Congress on this.\xc2\xa0 Members of his team have consulted with regularly on Congress -- with Congress on Libya.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is now somewhat stale, so the number of engagements is higher.\xc2\xa0 But more than 40 occasions that this administration has engaged with Congress on Libya, both in closed and open session, and in larger and small meetings, and in direct consultations, and we will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 So the President has had this discussion, and members of his team have had this discussion with Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, I will quantify it -- more than 40 occasions prior to the action in Libya?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Prior to -- I mean, since the action, and including prior to it, but within the context of the action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying again is why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just -- in efforts to stay above the fray and to keep peace, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just go to Congress and say, look, this is what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about doing?\xc2\xa0 I want to join --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he did.\xc2\xa0 He did have -- he did, as you know, have leaders down here before the mission began, first of all.\xc2\xa0 Second of all, the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal is not to keep the peace and stay above the fray.\xc2\xa0 That is not the mission of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 He saw an urgent need that needed to be addressed; an imminent massacre; a unique set of circumstances that allowed for a broad multinational coalition that was willing to take action; a significant resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And that -- those factors combined to lead the President to believe that he took -- that the action he took was the right action to take, and he consulted with Congress about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, twice you said that Congress shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send mixed messages on Libya.\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because I think that it is important that -- well, first of all, because I think Congress does share our goals in -- broadly, our goals in Libya, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to make it clear to Qaddafi and others that that unity of goal -- in terms of the shared goals exist.\xc2\xa0 And we are not in any way suggesting that Congress shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t express its opinion or have these discussions -- and we are in these consultations regularly.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a just a broad point that we share these goals, we have consulted regularly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve answered these questions.\xc2\xa0 We understand there are concerns, and we continue to answer those concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not questioning Congress\xe2\x80\x99s right to ask questions about it, what\xe2\x80\x99s the mixed message?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that they are sending more than one message about how they view Libya, about our -- whether our goals are the right ones, and how we achieve them.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- that they are not well within their rights to express concern or objections and raise questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask Sam, and I just -- I wanted to ask you if you noted that Josh Beckett had a masterful performance yesterday, a one-hitter with 97 pitches -- a shutout.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was beautiful.\xc2\xa0 Am I supposed to ask my question now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to make sure -- (laughter) -- I thought maybe they were playing this afternoon, because I saw your head down.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you were --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m updating my fantasy team.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before you refer me to the Department of Justice -- (laughter) -- Senator Lautenberg sent a letter to the White House yesterday expressing disapproval with the lack of action on gun policy from this administration and calling for more presidential leadership, not Department of Justice leadership.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the reaction is from the White House.\xc2\xa0 And how do you push back against the notion that nothing has been done on guns when the records show that nothing has been done on guns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night, UK Chancellor George Osborne endorsed a plan to separate retail banking from investment banking activities as part of a response to the global financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 Since the U.S. is a part of the same global financial marketplace, does this administration believe this may affect competition between the U.S. and the UK in the financial services market?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of question that I think the Treasury Department is best suited to answer, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department -- especially on the second part.\xc2\xa0 Overall, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to note that as countries around the globe have dealt with the crisis that occurred in 2008, the financial sector crisis and then the recession that ensured -- obviously every country is different and the way they deal with it is different. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have, because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, took very significant action to pass financial reforms, financial sector reforms, and we continue to implement those.\xc2\xa0 But again, each country addresses these issues differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the kind of thing he\xe2\x80\x99d discuss with the PM, Prime Minister Cameron?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Toshi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on the job creation.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, at Cree in North Carolina, the President laid out a new initiative to train 10,000 new American engineers to compete, I guess, with the other countries.\xc2\xa0 And could you elaborate a little bit how it would work?\xc2\xa0 And also how -- it is said that it\xe2\x80\x99s a private sector-led initiative, but how is government really involved?\xc2\xa0 I mean, will the government provide any -- or would not provide anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe it is a private sector initiative that we support.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come up to me -- I do have -- the way this job works, on Monday I could have told you so many things about that, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s been displaced by Libya and other things -- (laughter) -- my bandwidth being limited.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re correct, it is a private sector initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And look, we are looking for ways -- actions the government can take, actions the private sector can take.\xc2\xa0 This is an all-hands-on-deck situation, as it has been, since the moment we took -- we came to the White House.\xc2\xa0 So we were -- the President was very encouraged by the Jobs Council meeting and the ideas that were generated there -- I think two dozen ideas, many of them very promising, he thinks.\xc2\xa0 And that was just one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 George.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You just mentioned your personal friendship with the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 In this week of golf games and picnics, can you talk about the value of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no plans to play golf with anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talk about the value of building personal relationships between the President and leaders from the other party in Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think he and I have addressed this before.\xc2\xa0 He feels that it is a very useful thing to do; that -- and I know the Vice President, whom I also work for and worked more directly for in the past, feels very strongly about this, too, that part of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Washington has been that the normal human interactions you have with people that you might disagree with on policy have become far and fewer between, and that that\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly helpful for constructive dialogue, because we have big issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the nature that we need to solve and the nature of our system is that for better or worse -- and we think for better because we think it\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully good system, the American system -- it requires bipartisan cooperation to get anything significant done.\xc2\xa0 That is almost always the case.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly the case when you have one party in the White House and the other party in control of one or both houses of Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So these kinds of meetings, this kind of communication are, I think, very helpful.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily produce tangible progress on legislation, but they do produce the potential for a better atmosphere in the room when important things are discussed and negotiated.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has encouraged the kind of encounters that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with members of Congress, with the leadership, with Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell, for example, as well as Democrats; why he asked the conferences and caucuses of each house to come to the White House earlier this year; and why he invited the Speaker to play golf this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it make it easier for him to cut through his staff and just pick up the phone and call somebody like the Speaker --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, no question, no question. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 I know you guys got somewhere to go at 2:00 p.m., right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:02 P.M.
