EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, how\'s it going?\xc2\xa0 So don\'t ask me any questions I don\'t know the answers to.<br/> <br/>  I\'ll just let you know a little bit about what\'s going to happen when we hit the ground.\xc2\xa0 The town hall will be held at the Orange County Fairgrounds, Costa Mesa, where the President\'s remarks will focus on restoring our nation\'s prosperity right now and making the strategic decisions to create sustained long-term growth.\xc2\xa0 He will then take one hour of questions from the audience.<br/> <br/>  The President will be introduced by Jerome Ruddins, he\'s a surveyor/construction manager who has worked on public works projects throughout southern California.\xc2\xa0 Jerome works at RBF Consulting, which is a medium-sized engineering/surveying firm that will work on S.R. 91, a job-creating highway expansion project in Orange County.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be joined at the event by various local and federal officials, including Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis.<br/> <br/>  A couple of facts about Costa Mesa and California:\xc2\xa0 The latest job numbers in California show a 10.1 percent unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 In Orange County alone, from December \'08 to January \'09 they\'ve lost 33,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 And in Orange County alone they\'ve had 757 foreclosures in February of \'09 -- that\'s according to the Orange County Register.\xc2\xa0 I can get you a list of the other folks who will be joining him at the event -- which include state officials and assembly folks.<br/> <br/>  And that\'s about it.\xc2\xa0 With that, I\'ll take a couple questions.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to announce any new programs, initiatives aimed at responding to the particular problems in California?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What he\'s going to talk about are his recovery plan as a first step and this budget at the next step in this process:\xc2\xa0 making important investments, being fiscally responsible by cutting the deficit in half, and getting this economy going again.<br/> <br/>  California is a place where the investments in things like education and health care are very important, but energy as well, where -- and tomorrow we\'ll talk about this a little bit more -- by encouraging growth in the industry of alternative energies we\'ll be able to create a lot of jobs and also save the environment, to boot.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no new programs beyond the stimulus plan, the budget, so forth?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.\xc2\xa0 This is part of the effort to talk to Californians and Americans altogether about what it is we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 That includes -- you know, the President is going to be on Jay Leno tomorrow; he\'s going to sit down with "60 Minutes" for an interview on Friday that will air on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of different things that we\'re doing, this is a part of that effort to speak with the American people.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s a story in The New York Times today about Predator missiles and possibly expanding the scope in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Is that completely accurate, and can you add any more details to the thinking in those reviews about Afghanistan and Pakistan?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t comment about such issues.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the timing on the -- getting to the end of the review?\xc2\xa0 We\'re hearing it\'s quite close.\xc2\xa0 Are we, sort of, within days of the President making a decision or --<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has said that he\'s going to -- that he\'s instructed folks to get to the end of the review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy by the time they go to the NATO summit, and that\'s on track.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have exact figures on how much California is slated to get from the recovery plan?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I can get you those numbers.\xc2\xa0 I do, actually, in the front of the plane.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is Schwarzenegger planning to be at any events with the President over the next couple of days?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I know that our offices have spoken.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he\'ll actually be at any events, but I\'ll keep you posted.(*)\xc2\xa0 Not today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President spoke before he left the White House about setting up a resolution authority.\xc2\xa0 When are we going to get details about how that\'s going to work?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s working with Congress right now to get that done.\xc2\xa0 This morning he spoke with Chairman Frank.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner is meeting with Chairman Frank later today -- actually maybe right now -- in Washington, to discuss the best way forward on this and broader regulatory reform.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why did it take two days for the Treasury Secretary to tell the White House and, subsequently the President, to be informed about the -- what were then the impending bonuses?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m going to refer you to what the President had to say before Marine One took off from the White House.\xc2\xa0 But he, of course, is taking responsibility for what we do here, and what he\'s making sure is that we get the tools that we need to make sure that this does not happen again.<br/> <br/>  As for, you know, timelines and different things like that, we\'ve been through this for the past couple of days, and Gibbs and others and folks at the Treasury have answered these questions.\xc2\xa0 And for any more specifics on that, I\'d refer you to some of the information that they shared with folks yesterday.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, up until now, Robert -- until the timeline was released last night, we didn\'t exactly know what the sequence was.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, is there any concern that it took two days for the Treasury Secretary to tell the White House about it?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As the President said, he\'s very confident in how Secretary Geithner is doing.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, one of the things that we\'re going to talk about today in California -- because I imagine people are going to have questions about AIG, these bonuses, things that are happening in the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President, as he has said, shares the profound anger of the American people about these bonuses, about the folks who are getting them.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re doing everything we can to make sure that this doesn\'t happen again and to make sure that taxpayers are made whole on the money that\'s been paid out.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate any change in the internal communication system, though, so that it will flow more smoothly, more quickly?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As I said, the President feels good about how Secretary Geithner is doing, and we\'re looking forward at what we can do to make sure that we don\'t see these sort of egregious problems ever again.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bonuses that have already been paid at AIG, there\'s really nothing that can be done about that, at least from the executive branch -- is that the thinking?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the good news is some progress has actually been made on this, in the sense that -- and Liddy talked about this in his testimony today -- some folks at AIG have already paid back their bonuses.\xc2\xa0 Other people are being encouraged to do the exact same thing.<br/> <br/>  So some progress is getting made on that.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner outlined how taxpayers would be made whole in his letter to Congress last night, and I can get that to you if you don\'t, by chance, have it.<br/> <br/>  And, you know, so we\'re going to be working with AIG to see what we can do here to make sure that taxpayers are getting exactly what they deserve from the investments that we\'re making in order to stabilize that company.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President see any of the testimony?\xc2\xa0 Did he hear about it?\xc2\xa0 Has he been briefed on it?\xc2\xa0 And more generally, what does the White House -- is the White House satisfied with what Liddy had to say?\xc2\xa0 He said things like, you know, we have to pay the bonuses to keep people -- good people onboard so that we can maximize the return to the taxpayer.\xc2\xa0 I mean, how does the White House sort of react to his testimony?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, because I only saw a tiny little bit -- a tiny piece of it, I\'m going to have to refer you to folks on the ground who actually watched the whole thing and were able to see it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed?\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on Liddy\'s testimony today?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It just -- it literally just ended before I walked out here, so I don\'t know that that would be the case just yet.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Weren\'t the prepared remarks out -- weren\'t the prepared remarks out before we took off?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I guess I don\'t know if he had seen the prepared remarks.<br/> <br/>  All right?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you all.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who else is he -- who else is he meeting with out here?\xc2\xa0 Anything behind the scenes, in terms of who he\'s going to see, that sort of thing?<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, some of the folks include local officials, like Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, she\'ll be there; the Lieutenant Governor.\xc2\xa0 I can get you some more folks.\xc2\xa0 John Garamendi; the Secretary of State Debra Bowen; Attorney General Jerry Brown; State Controller John Chiang; State Senator Jose Correa; Kamala Harris; Jack O\'Connell, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction; Miguel Pulido, the Mayor of Santa Ana; and Jose Solorio, who is another state representative.<br/> <br/>  All right.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot.<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You bet.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See you later.<br/> <br/>  MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  3:30 P.M.
