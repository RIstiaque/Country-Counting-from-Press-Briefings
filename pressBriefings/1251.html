GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, could you give us some detail about the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on the revelation of this new enrichment facility?\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m not going to get into intelligence or anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say that obviously their claims, if true, contradict the pledges and commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made repeatedly to the international community.\xc2\xa0 As you know, our representatives are traveling in the region right now to brief our partners and our allies and coordinating a policy response to their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said, \xe2\x80\x9cif true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is it still in doubt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to discuss intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While the parties involved are trying to get North Korea to comply to the six-party process, does the White House view that this threat is deepening?\xc2\xa0 Is this another example of that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to separate those for just a second.\xc2\xa0 I think the six-party process can -- and the administration believes the six-party process can play an important role if and when the North Koreans take that six-party process to move toward denuclearization seriously.\xc2\xa0 We do not wish to talk simply for the sake of talking.\xc2\xa0 North Koreans have to be serious about living up to their obligations, and not having done so has put the sanctions regime in place that is the strongest the country has ever faced and has greatly increased the price of their noncompliance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat was your second --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the while, is the threat deepening from North Korea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the threat has always been serious.\xc2\xa0 We have certainly taken it as such and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we went to the U.N. to get a stronger sanctions regime on their ability to move anything out of their country that could do others harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic, please.\xc2\xa0 On the controversy that\'s emerged about the security screening process at airports, does the White House have a view about the planned protests on Wednesday at airports and how that might affect both security and travel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that our TSA Administrator, Mr. Pistole, addressed that in some interviews this morning.\xc2\xa0 I would just remind people that -- well, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 First I\'d point obviously to what the President had to say on this Saturday evening in Lisbon, and that is we put in place enhanced security measures for the simple reason that for more than two decades al Qaeda and terrorists have sought to do us harm and have focused in on aviation and airplanes.\xc2\xa0 Just in the past year we\'ve seen the Christmas Day attempt by Mr. Abdulmutallab to blow up an airplane using a device that, as the President said, would not have and was not picked up by a simple metal detector.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJust in the past few weeks alone we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an effort by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to bring down an airplane using explosives in cargo.\xc2\xa0 So we must do everything that we can to protect the public.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President, again, as you heard him say a few days ago, in meeting with Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Pistole has said, our goal must be to maximize protection and security and minimize inconvenience and invasiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe asked them then and continues to ask those that we do all that we can to protect the public and do so in a way that is the least inconvenient as possible.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy task.\xc2\xa0 But we know that al Qaeda -- we know from intelligence that al Qaeda seeks to do harm through aviation security, through devices concealed on a body inside of a device that one might take onto an airplane or in luggage that\'s put on an airplane.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo our charge is to do all that we can to protect those that travel, but also to do so in a way that\'s, as I said, minimally invasive.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a balance that we will continue to search for.\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is -- this was a process that, based on intelligence and based on feedback, is and will continue to evolve and change.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the nature of both the threat and the response to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think that -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked, well, will you take into account some of people\xe2\x80\x99s concerns or complaints based on medical conditions or how they feel personally about some of this?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 We seek to do -- as I said, we seek to maximize the security and protection and minimize that invasiveness.\xc2\xa0 So this is a -- these are procedures that will continue to evolve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, the charge of the TSA is to ensure that when you or I or others get onto an airplane that we can feel reasonably assured that we can travel safely.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President wants certainly most of all around travel for this Thanksgiving holiday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what happened between Sunday, when the head of the TSA seemed to be signaling no ground on the searches and pat-downs, and Sunday night and this morning, when he is talking about the need for some flexibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that anything in particular happened except -- again, I think if you look at what the President\xe2\x80\x99s charge has been in a flexible and evolving security process is to ensure exactly what I just told Ben, that we put the utmost importance on protection and to do so in a way -- have that carried out in a way that is the least inconvenient for those that travel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and, look, the policies have to evolve.\xc2\xa0 Remember, when we originally -- and this is years ago, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use a couple of examples.\xc2\xa0 When we originally did TSA screenings, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to take your shoes off.\xc2\xa0 Then someone tried to put a bomb in their shoes and X-raying shoes was something that was important. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved obviously to something where Mr. Abdulmutallab had a device on himself that walking through a metal detector is not going to go off.\xc2\xa0 Because of that, we moved to AITs -- advanced imaging technology -- to provide security screeners with a better opportunity to detect whether or not somebody is trying to smuggle, again, something concealed on themselves, concealed in what would be a normal device or in their luggage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also wanted to ask about START.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered Senator Kyl\xe2\x80\x99s concerns on this issue?\xc2\xa0 At what point does it just become a political disagreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as the President said on Saturday, that we take everyone at their word that they are here to protect and do all that they can to protect the country.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with Senator Kyl last week --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that before or after he made his --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 After.\xc2\xa0 After.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President continues to speak to senators from both sides of the aisle on trying to move this process forward.\xc2\xa0 Look, if Senator Kyl has questions we\'re happy to address them and to meet them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what -- that\'s an important thing to do in this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, if you look at what the series and range of statements that we heard over the course of the weekend from the military, from those retired in the military who had operational roles in our nuclear security, hearing from our allies in NATO and particularly our allies in Eastern Europe, those closest to Russia and the old Soviet Union, in saying clearly that ratification of this treaty is in their best interest and our best interest in getting it done quickly -- that\'s I think a tremendously important endorsement for those efforts in curtailing the number of deployed nuclear weapons and ensuring an inspection regime as it relates to the Russian nuclear program.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the TSA rules, when Secretary Clinton was asked yesterday on CBS whether she would submit to this, she laughed and said that she wouldn\'t want to.\xc2\xa0 How can you ask the rest of the public to follow through on these rules if a senior administration official laughs at them and says she wouldn\'t do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Ed, if you go back to look at the course of her interviews, I think she also says that -- look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d all love to live in a world and exist in a place where none of this is required.\xc2\xa0 But as she said, we don\'t have that luxury because, as I said earlier, we\'ve known for two decades that al Qaeda and terrorists of the like have sought to do harm using an airplane, inside the aviation -- inside the realm of aviation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, first and foremost, to avoid something like that, one should go through the AIT.\xc2\xa0 One should go through that screening device in order to be on a plane.\xc2\xa0 But I think, Ed, what she was saying was if you look at -- we live in a world where, of course, nobody would want to -- it would be nice to live in a world where that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary.\xc2\xa0 But again, just less than a year ago we know that somebody got on an airplane with the intent of blowing it up using a device that would not have been picked up by a metal detector and that\'s cause for quite a bit of security concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if the regulations are so important now to prevent another Abdulmutallab, why did it take nearly a year to put this system in place?\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t it happen in February, March, April -- it happened last Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are a series of procedures that have been phased in.\xc2\xa0 We have AITs -- advanced imaging technology -- those are the machines at I believe 69 of roughly 400 or 450 airports throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there has been a process for the construction and the procurement of those machines.\xc2\xa0 But it was not going to happen overnight. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd, look, I think that as the security system involving pat-downs, as I said earlier, has evolved, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that just started a week or so ago.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been phased in over a series of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick on North Korea, various officials like Secretary Gates have said they knew in general North Korea wanted to enrich uranium, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about this specific facility.\xc2\xa0 Is that a failure of U.S. intelligence then that it took the North Koreans to tell the U.S., here it is?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into openly discussing the intelligence on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have a new poll on some of these security measures being taken.\xc2\xa0 Nearly half the public says they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the health risks possible because of the new scanners or unsure about the health risks.\xc2\xa0 The administration\xe2\x80\x99s position is that there are no health risks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position, based on studies through the FDA and others that the imaging technology provides so little in terms of -- you\'re exposed, the truth is, to greater exposure sitting in an airplane than you do going through one of those machines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why has the administration failed to convince so many members of the public that there are no health concerns about these new scanners? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\'ve not seen the poll but I don\'t --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that there are a lot of people --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me find -- if you have another question -- let me try to find this in my paper here, and I think I\'ve got something I think I can talk to you about on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the other question I have, also about the TSA, is that the public does support -- they do care about security.\xc2\xa0 But when there is an intrusion on privacy they want it to be targeted and justified.\xc2\xa0 You spend a lot of time on the Internet; you watch YouTube and you obviously spend a great deal of time watching cable.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t you --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- all that you might presume, but I\'ll accept the premise of your question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think -- are you confident that the TSA intrusions onto people\xe2\x80\x99s privacy have been targeted and justified?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 There are -- we are used to the understanding of a profile that looks at a range of people, for instance, 18 to 35.\xc2\xa0 Yet we\'ve seen just in the past year, we know of people that have been arrested in this country for terrorism that would not fit into the range of those ages.\xc2\xa0 We know specifically that AQAP was targeting in Mr. Abdulmutallab somebody that did not have the characteristics that those previously that had attempted to do us harm through an airliner\xc2\xa0 -- that they shared.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe know that they are continually looking for ways -- and I think the cargo example is a very good one -- of ways in which they can take something that looks normal or a situation that appears not out of the ordinary, to augment that in a way that gets past security and does us harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think this -- what we would normally think of as, okay, these are the characteristics of what might happen -- understand that we have seen and we know about very specific efforts to find people outside of what security might normally be conditioned to look for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe know that -- I mean, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s an accident that AQAP through Mr. Abdulmutallab was seeking to -- through concealing this device on him, get onto a plane something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be in a metal detector, that would be delivered by somebody that would not normally be seen as somebody associated or affiliated with AQAP, in an effort to get around what you would normally be constructed or set up to look for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that our -- I go back again to what I said to Ben -- that in and of itself provides the foundation or the basis for how security policy and screening has to evolve, because the nature of whatever the threat is today is going to be different in three to six months because they\'re going to be trying to find different ways around what\xe2\x80\x99s been set up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think that goes back again to what Secretary of State Clinton said.\xc2\xa0 Look, we would love -- and the President said this -- we have an apparatus now that greets us in going into buildings or getting onto an airplane that didn\'t exist before.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99d love to go back to a world in which none of that had to exist, but we have to continue to evolve and meet the threat that is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re a parent.\xc2\xa0 The President is a father.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of parents out there whose children have been subjected to pat-downs, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been very upset by it.\xc2\xa0 There have been individuals with medical conditions who have been forced into humiliating situations.\xc2\xa0 This is evolution?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that anybody under 12 goes through something much more modified.\xc2\xa0 I would say, first and foremost -- and I think if the TSA Administrator was here, he would say this to you as well -- has all of this been done perfectly?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 If somebody feels as if they have been unduly subjected to something that they find to be far more invasive than the line of convenience and security, they should speak to a TSA representative at the airport.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, without leaning too far into this, Jake, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that it\xe2\x80\x99s not out of the realm of possibility to think that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be somewhat careful here -- that those that wish to do people harm via an airplane haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at some of the ways through explosives in devices or luggage or on themselves that we know can get around and through security.\xc2\xa0 And we have to be careful about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, I think we are trying -- and TSA is trying -- desperately to strike that balance.\xc2\xa0 That will evolve.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the evolution of the security will be done with the input of those that go through the security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand since the more stepped-up pat-down process has taken place, approximately 34 million people have been through the TSA system.\xc2\xa0 I think the figure that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that about a percent of those that have gone through the process have gone -- through the overall screening process have gone through this more stepped-up procedure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 During the period between the time the TSA Administrator made the comments that sounded like there was no give at all and later making clear that there was going to have to be some flexibility here, were there any conversations with him by anybody at the White House?\xc2\xa0 Did anybody speak to him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am sure people at the White House speak with TSA and to DHS constantly on security, on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But about that topic, about whether there should be some flexibility?\xc2\xa0 And were his later comments suggesting flexibility as a result of those conversations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look -- again, Chip, I think what the President said on Saturday is he communicated that to TSA and DHS several weeks ago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about between the comments in the morning that created this controversy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every conversation, but do I assume that people here have constantly been in touch with them? Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying specifically with regard to the inflexibility he suggested in those comments, did somebody at the White House call him and say, that\xe2\x80\x99s not our message?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every conversation that happens with every person here.\xc2\xa0 But if you are asking me if people are constantly in touch with and talk to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you did they specifically respond?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure conversations have happened, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About that particular lack of flexibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Chip, I don\'t know every conversation.\xc2\xa0 I just assume that a lot of those conversations have happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did not talk to him about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not talked with the TSA Administrator.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask -- and I don\'t -- I\'m reluctant to get graphic here, but everybody knows there are theoretical possibilities way beyond what Abdulmutallab did, with body cavities and such.\xc2\xa0 Why respond so specifically to what he did with searches --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in that particular area when there are so many other possibilities out there that I don\'t think anybody even dreams you would actually subject people to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- again, I think that -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take this somewhat broader.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the progression in screening writ large, right?\xc2\xa0 We all remember you put your stuff on the -- it goes through the X-ray machine, you walk through a magnetometer, right?\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the evolution of something that\'s going to detect something that\'s metal.\xc2\xa0 We now know that -- again, if you look at the evolution of security of plots and attempts, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got shoes, liquids, again, based on specific attempts to use those very devices to do harm -- and again, the transitioning to an AIT, which gives you the ability to detect something that might be on someone hoping to do you harm but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\'s metal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Completely changing topics, on tax cuts, is the President -- you said the Vice President is working the phones with senators on both sides of the aisle on START.\xc2\xa0 Is the President or anybody at a high level in the administration doing the same thing with senators on tax cuts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- look, while I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Leg Affairs and others are discussing issues like taxes that will be dealt with in the lame duck, the President to my knowledge has not -- other than the meeting last week, has not made calls.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On START or taxes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on START?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just do one more?\xc2\xa0 On the millionaires tax,\xc2\xa0 there\xe2\x80\x99s this group of millionaires now saying that they don\'t want to extend the tax cuts for millionaires; they say it\xe2\x80\x99s their patriotic duty.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about that?\xc2\xa0 Is it patriotic to campaign to pay more taxes if you\'re a millionaire?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- though I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be the spokesperson for Warren Buffett -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I bet that\'s a good gig.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s slightly above the millionaire threshold.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI don\'t necessarily have anything to add on that except, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen or heard from -- again, using Mr. Buffett as an example -- I mean, Mr. Buffett is somebody whose marginal tax rate based on where he derives his income is, as I think he said before -- pays at a rate that\'s far less than that of presumably his spokesperson -- though he\xe2\x80\x99s his spokesperson -- than his secretary, because he derives a vast majority of his income from investments rather than from his paycheck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on two questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back over there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Different subject.\xc2\xa0 Steny Hoyer says -- not just in light of the Ghailani verdict --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, don\'t forget --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m -- (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Forget you?\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in light of the election earlier this month, he says, it is, in his way of thinking, impossible that Congress is going to approve the money for federal civilian trials of Guantanamo Bay detainees.\xc2\xa0 Are you willing to basically give up on that idea now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said something different last week.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t\xc2\xa0 -- we spent the first row here talking about al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 We know al Qaeda uses the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting effort to seek those -- the participation of those interested in doing us harm because of that.\xc2\xa0 I think to give up on that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not giving up on that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Conversely, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost two years into the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to close it.\xc2\xa0 Are you willing to commit to closing it in 2011?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to commit to closing it as soon as possible to close it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any way you can put any possible time frame on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think I said last week that no one expects this to be easy, but I know that the President has not and will not give up on the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is on START, and my question will be whether or not -- is whether or not the administration is willing to hand over the entire START record?\xc2\xa0 And let me tell you why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking this.\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a new Republican senator coming in, Mark Kirk, who has quite a shopping list of things he wants before he says he can even think about this, a complete negotiation record of the treaty, also the documents relating to the parallel discussions with the U.S.-Russian resale, all classified briefings about having to terminate liability of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- the Russia resale?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the U.S.-Russian missile defense, the talks that were conducted by Ellen Tauscher.\xc2\xa0 This is according to \xe2\x80\x9cForeign Policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He wants a whole written analysis of all U.S. Strategic Command information that supports a treaty.\xc2\xa0 He wants all the planning documents.\xc2\xa0 And he wants formal briefings with State, Defense and Energy.\xc2\xa0 What is the posture of the White House -- will they possibly be able to accommodate a want list like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, not knowing specifically -- thank you -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to obviously have somebody look at the technical list.\xc2\xa0 But I think a lot of what Senator-elect Kirk is looking for in way of documentation and briefing and questions, I don\'t know if some of that has been asked and answered and we\xe2\x80\x99d certainly provide that documentation to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think a discussion with somebody like General Cartwright on missile defense or others at a classified level -- those are conversations that are being had currently with senators right now.\xc2\xa0 So I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s information that we have that can help answer those questions, we\xe2\x80\x99d be more than happy to provide that information, those briefings, that documentation to Senator-elect Kirk or anybody else in order to demonstrate -- General Cartwright would tell him this has no effect on our ability to conduct our own missile defense activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think a pretty good example of that is NATO agreeing to the President\xe2\x80\x99s phased adaptive approach to protect Europe at a meeting that saw the Russians ultimately participate in at the same time they are arguing -- people like the head of NATO are arguing for ratification of the treaty.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, look, I think -- I don\'t know if Senator-elect Kirk has talked to anybody on the national security staff here, but I don\'t doubt that if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, that folks here will reach out rather quickly to provide information that he thinks is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it -- I heard that so far -- that some senators -- that the White House has refused -- or various entities in the administration has refused to turn over the negotiation record.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with, as I said a minute ago, Lynn, each and every aspect of -- I\'m happy to ask NSC whether that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think two of the best spokespeople -- three of the best spokespeople for our defense posture as it relates to this treaty are the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- that\'s General Cartwright -- again, he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of the missile expert in that realm.\xc2\xa0 And I think all of them are very good spokespeople for how this enhances our security and our protection rather than the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick one.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, you mentioned that this latest regime of U.N. sanctions is among the strongest or is the strongest the country has ever faced.\xc2\xa0 Well, then is there concern that these sanctions haven\'t been strong enough or working well enough to prevent this facility from being built?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into the timing of the facility, the sanctions that were put on North Korea and hinders greatly its ability to move product outside of the country are -- date back I think sometime to mid-last year.\xc2\xa0 So I think that -- again, that was in direct response to the testing of a long-range missile in late March, early April -- I forget the exact date.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, look, I think you can go back many, many years to the North Koreans walking away from their obligations in six-party talks, in discussions with their neighbors, their partners and their allies, and flaunting of those international standards.\xc2\xa0 That, we\'ve been aware of for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the sanctions don\'t -- I mean, are you saying that -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this plant built rather quickly, in the last couple of years or year or more?\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not going to get into the specifics of what\xe2\x80\x99s in the intelligence, but understanding that\xc2\xa0 -- again, what you just asked and when the sanctions -- the sanctions based off of what the U.N. did last year are -- those don\'t line up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly on START, you guys have said that the midterms show that the American public wants Democrats and Republicans to work together.\xc2\xa0 And so given that, why not be more direct in accusing the GOP or accusing Senator Kyl of being -- playing politics on START?\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to really kind of shy away from saying that directly over the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President said that we live in an atmosphere in this town that normally, if one side wants to do something then the other side doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do something.\xc2\xa0 I think given who you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in terms of validators and supporters of this treaty, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit the mold of what we normally see in a political issue.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t think it should fit that mold given who those supporters are.\xc2\xa0 We think this is something that can and should get done over the course of the next several weeks and certainly before the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Senator Simpson, from the deficit commission, said something colorful about the fight to raise the debt limit.\xc2\xa0 He said there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a big fight and there will be \xe2\x80\x9chair and eyeballs all over the floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So are you guys concerned that Tea Party Republicans or others will stand in their way --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A little hair or eyeball -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- will stand in their way of raising -- of course, looking on the next Congress -- but are you concerned that people will stand -- new Republicans will stand in the way of raising the debt limit in a way that can really hurt?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I think we\'ve got a ways to go before we get to the situation and the scene that former Senator Simpson describes.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what I think the incoming House speaker said last week.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with, I think his words were \xe2\x80\x9cas adults.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We understand that we did not get into a debt crisis in the last year or two years; that this is something that has built up for many, many, many years.\xc2\xa0 And we have to deal with that and put ourselves back on a path towards some fiscal sustainability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up Chip?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re such a gentleman, Robert, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer his basic question, which is a very serious question.\xc2\xa0 If somebody is hiding explosives in a body cavity, do these machines pick that up?\xc2\xa0 And, also, the other thing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Connie, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to understand that I am -- let me give you two answers.\xc2\xa0 One, I think it is very safe to say that as the threat has evolved, our screening process has had to and has evolved.\xc2\xa0 I think you can understand why I would not want to get into the intricacies of exactly what would be detected, how and when, because we do know that those that want to get around those procedures watch what it is we do and what we say.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you saying that at this point if under suspicion -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re hiding something in a body cavity, it can be detected by the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that in order to address the most<br/>\n\tup-to-date threats possible, we have instituted the very best in technology and in screening efforts in order to detect that threat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the Israeli system, where they\xe2\x80\x99re questioning before they even get close to the gate?\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point out that I think the Israelis have, I think, it\xe2\x80\x99s two airports -- two international airports.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one, I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- in Tel Aviv.\xc2\xa0 We have 450.\xc2\xa0 This is -- there is a scale that is -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched and read the stories of, well, can\xe2\x80\x99t you just do what -- understanding the scale involved is infinitely different. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 First, next week, Wednesday, the President\xe2\x80\x99s debt commission is due to reach its conclusions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have anything planned off of that to try to pick up the ball where they leave off?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not looked through next week\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, Jonathan, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know the process after that.\xc2\xa0 But I can go back and check.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on START, President and Senator Lugar both said if this treaty gets to the floor of the Senate, it will pass.\xc2\xa0 So what kind of conversations are going on between President Obama or Vice President Biden and Harry Reid to make that happen?\xc2\xa0 Because I mean ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Reid that will schedule that vote.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is a priority of this administration, the President and the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 It was a topic that came up -- it comes up, has come up in conversations between staff here and the Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s staff, and in conversations directly with the Majority Leader.\xc2\xa0 It is a priority of ours to see it put on the floor and acted upon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it worse for U.S. international relations or U.S.-Russian relations to see this go to the floor and fail than to see it not go to the floor at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is a -- for us not to get this done is, as you have seen those not just in our administration, but again throughout the weekend at NATO, discuss its impact on our security -- those countries, again -- I make mention of this, that border -- that represent that easternmost border with Russia are as -- believes this has to get done as urgently as we do.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an overwhelming endorsement for why delay on this just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 The news of the Irish bailout initially sparked only a short-lived rally in the financial markets, including the FTSE and the Dow this morning.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the President about the effect of the bailout on the U.S. and global markets?\xc2\xa0 And I have a follow-up, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we are -- we welcome Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s intention to seek that assistance and for Europe to deal with the crisis that affects those countries.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly made mention of it here, the impact of Greece on our recovery and acting quickly to deal with problems in Ireland by the Europeans is good news. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the bailout will stem the tide of other problems in the euro zone?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not a euro zone expert.\xc2\xa0 I think that addressing these causes and concerns quickly is a good step. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMark. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Wednesday, the President pardons another couple of turkeys.\xc2\xa0 Are there any people pardons in the pipeline?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m guessing that those aren\'t one and the same. (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would make news if they were.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with counsel to see the degree to which -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the process for active pardons in the administration. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had any yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, he has not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim Morrison in Florida -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a governor --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a gubernatorial issue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Irish bailout coming up in the President\xe2\x80\x99s daily briefings?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how closely is he monitoring the situation there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a topic that -- there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an economic daily briefing today, but I know it has come up in the past.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s been part of his briefing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that Portugal and Spain will also need to tap into this fund?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you, I guess, more particularly to their governments on that.\xc2\xa0 We have -- mostly I think the briefings that the President has got have focused primarily on -- well, primarily on Ireland and some on Portugal.\xc2\xa0 I have -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the extent that I can recall.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if today it came up at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an EDB today, so that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be speaking at a summit at the Chamber of Commerce in the next few months?\xc2\xa0 And what is he doing to reach out to the business community?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the second part, I certainly would point you to the first several days in India.\xc2\xa0 In terms of invitations from the Chamber, obviously we are and continue to be interested in speaking with them and their members and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if the schedule allows for that in the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 I know that they originally had an event for early in December that I think has been rescheduled to some time in January.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following up to your response to Chip\xe2\x80\x99s question, the President learned about these TSA procedures several weeks ago and he raised the concerns that he raised in Portugal at the time as well.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question, have you personally went through either one of these AIT machines or the pat-down?\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s only been recently -- I was curious if you personally --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Personally, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through an AIT.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think.\xc2\xa0 Most of -- as you might -- most of my travel is on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 I traveled to and from Atlanta a few weeks ago and I thought I went through one of the AITs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask about Kokomo, the stop tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Part of it is at a Chrysler plant.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this is a way of showing a little love for Chrysler, having lavished it on G.M. last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- this is a particular plant in Kokomo that because of some of the restructuring and some of the funding for retooling and modernization is a transmission plant that was able to retain more than 1,000 workers rather than seeing its plant shuttered.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, look, we are -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been to and will continue to go Chrysler, G.M., even Ford facilities -- a company that didn\'t have to receive restructuring help.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think if you look at some of these places and plants that are located throughout the country, particularly in the Midwest, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see\xc2\xa0 -- and Kokomo is a pretty good example of a town that is very dependent upon those types of jobs for its economic livelihood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think those are -- that\'s important, and I think the President is proud of our efforts to ensure -- whether there was a thousand there or more than a million people throughout the country whose jobs were saved as part of that restructuring, understanding that that restructuring was about making some difficult choices.\xc2\xa0 Some plants were closed.\xc2\xa0 We know there were corporate restructurings, particularly at General Motors, in order to get both of these companies pointed in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why does the President believe --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I called on Ann. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you come back to me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on what Mark asked --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What specifically in terms of stimulus does the President think he can still get out of the lame duck Congress, either specific, other stimulus items that he had talked about before?\xc2\xa0 And is your to-do list for the lame duck session getting shorter and shorter?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s less time left.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, and I think we talked a little bit about this last week.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that -- I don\'t think many people believe that the week that we came back before -- basically last week -- we obviously know this week was largely held off for Thanksgiving and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll be back again a week from today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think many people believe that that first week back was going to be a period in which a lot of legislative business would be gone through.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt is traditionally an orientation and a caucus organizing process on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got members and senators that are leaving.\xc2\xa0 You have new members and new senators that are coming in. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is really more on what you\'re actually going to get done.\xc2\xa0 You didn\'t have a chance to meet with the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But again, a lot of that is focused toward January.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s on the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- but, Ann, I think you know that, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, that meeting is happening a week from tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So again, I think moving a meeting from one week to the next does not stymie our legislative agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s left on the to-do list?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a specific list for us of what you --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say several things.\xc2\xa0 This is not a totally exhaustive list because my memory is not what it used to be -- even from this morning.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, we\'ve got to deal with issues around taxes.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to have to deal with issues around unemployment insurance and compensation as well. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President make mention of START.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that is crucially important to our national security and to our foreign relations.\xc2\xa0 There are issues around "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" that the President and I think many people believe are best dealt with through a legislative process and not through a legal system.\xc2\xa0 There are priorities such as the DREAM Act.\xc2\xa0 There are several things that -- and again, I know I\'m probably leaving out more than I\'m mentioning, but I think we\'ve got -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt we have plenty of work to do.\xc2\xa0 I think we also have plenty of time with which to --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President ask the Pentagon to hurry up to November 30th -- the report, its internal report on --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the original date was December 1st.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the report is being released a day or so early in order to have some informed hearings on the survey and its results.\xc2\xa0 I think those hearings, if I\'m not mistaken, start on the 1st. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, if you look at what others have said, particularly -- take, for instance, Secretary Gates -- that we know -- we can do this legislatively -- the House has done this, the Senate can do this -- do this legislatively which provides an avenue with which to implement the policy.\xc2\xa0 A court doing this is not likely to provide the Pentagon and others with a pathway for doing this.\xc2\xa0 And I think in order to do this in a way that the President and others see, that doing this legislatively is the best way to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on two separate issues.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s such a focus on security at airports.\xc2\xa0 We talked about how we know that terrorists are focusing in on using airlines as some of their ways to commit terror.\xc2\xa0 But what about this country\xe2\x80\x99s rail system?\xc2\xa0 What about the security for rail?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we saw it in London in the Tube; we saw Spain on the rail system there.\xc2\xa0 What about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s rail system and subway system in major cities?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Without getting, again, into a lot of detail about what\xe2\x80\x99s out there, I think -- let me say this -- I think to presume that only aviation is -- that only aviation security is a priority is not the case.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\'s passenger rail, there\'s cargo rail, there\'s a whole host of different ways in which we know terror can be brought into this country.\xc2\xa0 Aviation is not the only thing that we are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 We know that -- I think if I\'m recalling correctly, the plot that Mr. Zazi was planning dealt specifically with some aspects of transportation beyond that of airports.\xc2\xa0 The only reason I mention airports is, again, we know for quite a long period of time this has been a focus of al Qaeda and its affiliates.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not finished.\xc2\xa0 But is Amtrak working off -- I\'m talking about passenger rail now -- because some of these corridors, particularly the East Coast corridor into Washington is very sensitive.\xc2\xa0 Is there any pushback from Amtrak?\xc2\xa0 Are you\xc2\xa0 -- is this administration working with Amtrak to try to work something out to enforce security on the rail system, passenger rail?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a lot of this stuff in front of me, April, but I can assure you -- and I would contact both DHS and Amtrak to discuss in particular regional, transcontinental passenger rail, all that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And also on my issue that I wanted to ask, we\'re now -- the midterms are over.\xc2\xa0 You said expect change after the midterms as far as administration staff.\xc2\xa0 Are we expecting to hear some names being dropped, of new moves, and are you going to stand at that podium much longer?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m going to be out here to answer a few more questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much longer?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question, Les.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me answer April\'s question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ll come back?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because there\'s a whole group of people and I think I called on you just last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\'t briefed since then, for goodness sakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but you recognized one of the front here for eight questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, let me answer the question that\'s been posed to me.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to pick on some other people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then you\'ll come back?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril, in terms of the reorganization, obviously that\'s something that the Chief of Staff, the President, and others are continuing to work on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timeline for when any of those announcements would be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what about you?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to leave us?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have spent very little time working on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGlenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, about a week ago a freshman Republican Congressman named Andy Harris from Maryland stood up apparently in a benefits session in the House and complained about how -- the time it would take, 28 days, for his government-subsidized health insurance to kick in.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there is -- some progressive groups called for House members who want to repeal the health reform law to renounce their health insurance.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\'s an element of hypocrisy here and do you think it would be a wise idea for them to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do think there seems to be an element of understanding the role that health insurance plays in the security of families regardless of their economic lot in life.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'m not going to make a blanket statement about what Congressman-elect Harris should do.\xc2\xa0 I would say that -- I think it\'s probably a pretty good demonstration of the fact that the rhetoric of what people say either throughout political debates or in campaigns, and the reality of how something like that impacts their lives, is apparently quite different just in this example alone.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s going to have to reconcile with himself the notion of health care that\'s subsidized by the American people and his statements surrounding that.\xc2\xa0 I think it presents a particularly interesting dilemma for those that have castigated that in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s hypocritical?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would agree with you; I think you think it is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on "don\'t ask, don\'t tell," the service chief of the Navy recently praised the Pentagon report and said he\'s eager to see what happens with the Hill regarding repeal.\xc2\xa0 But the remaining three service chiefs, they\'re all on the record as saying they want to wait for the report to come out before Congress takes action.\xc2\xa0 Does the President anticipate that once the report comes out, those service chiefs will be on board in favor of repeal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I think the service chiefs, as I understand it, are meeting with the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and with the Secretary as we get closer to this report coming out in order to discuss where they are based on that survey.\xc2\xa0 The President has not yet seen that survey so I don\'t want to presume whether, based on those results, that would change their opinion or not.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s best not to get too far down the road on commenting on that until we get a chance to personally see the substance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\'t that the purpose of the study, though?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said the President has been for repeal since you\'ve known him and the President has said he wants to work with military leaders.\xc2\xa0 In the State of the Union address, he said he wants to work with military leaders to get them on board with repeal.\xc2\xa0 So what\'s the point of this report if not to get those service chiefs on board?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not saying that it won\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying -- I think the original question you asked me is would that report change their mind.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the report.\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\'t seen that report.\xc2\xa0 And neither of us have had an opportunity to talk with the chiefs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to say that it won\'t.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to say that -- and quite frankly, that\'s not to say whether or not, whether you have unanimous agreement or not, that the policy -- look, the President has known where people have stood on this policy for as long as he\'s supporting changing that policy.\xc2\xa0 So I think it will be important to, again, view the attitudes, to view -- and to use those attitudes to craft a pathway to implementing a changed legislatively policy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President has advocated through this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, I can\'t -- we may have a better sense of that when we get an opportunity to talk to those that have seen the report and get a chance to look at that report ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the President had conversations directly with the service chiefs to get them -- repeal during the lame duck session of Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know the President has spoken previously with the service chiefs on this subject and I expect that as this report is finalized and released, that he\'ll have an opportunity to speak directly with the Chair of the Joint -- the Vice Chair and the service chiefs as this process moves forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:07 P.M.
