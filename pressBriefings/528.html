Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">1:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 There is no clearer path, as you know, to middle-class opportunity and success than higher education.\xc2\xa0 And many career-training programs are offering millions of students the opportunity to further their education and get ahead.\xc2\xa0 But too many bad actors are luring students in with promises of an education that will get them a high-paying job only to leave them with a mountain of unsustainable debt, and without a job or without the skills needed to succeed in the workforce.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">That\xe2\x80\x99s why, today, the Obama administration is taking action to protect Americans from predatory and poor-performing career programs that burden students with debt and leave them unprepared to succeed.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">I have with me today, as you can see, the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.\xc2\xa0 He is here to talk to you about the steps that he and the administration are taking with regard to these poor-performing career programs.\xc2\xa0 And as we traditionally do, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to direct questions you have for him on his areas of expertise at the top of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 I will remain to take your questions on other subjects, if you have questions on other subjects.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And with that, I give you Secretary Duncan.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Career-training programs offer millions of Americans an opportunity to further their education and reach the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And these values are absolutely the cornerstone of our economy, but too many of these programs today fail to provide students with the training they need at taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 expense and the cost of students\xe2\x80\x99 futures.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re taking action to protect Americans from poor-performing career programs that burden students with debt and leave them with few opportunities to succeed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Earlier this morning, we released a proposed regulation that addresses growing concerns about unaffordable levels of loan debt for students enrolled in gainful employment programs by targeting those that are the lowest-performing, while giving all programs the opportunity to improve.\xc2\xa0 This rule is designed to identify those programs.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re doing a good job, and target those that are failing both students and taxpayers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Over the past year, our Department of Education has collaborated with higher education leaders to determine how best to craft a rule that protects students from enrolling in poorly-performing programs that leave them saddled with debt that they can\'t repay, and with a degree or certificate that they cannot use.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">The effective programs, those that provide training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, include nearly all programs at for-profit institutions, as well as certificate programs at public and private nonprofit institutions, such as community colleges.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And here\xe2\x80\x99s how it will work.\xc2\xa0 Our department has proposed a framework with three different components:\xc2\xa0 First, certification requirements; second, accountability metrics; and third, public disclosures, greater transparency.\xc2\xa0 This proposal distinguishes programs that provide high-quality, affordable education and training from those that leave students with poor earnings prospects and high amounts of debt, or which lead to high student loan default rates.\xc2\xa0 The programs with the worst outcomes would lose eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs more quickly to protect those students and taxpayers, while other poor-performing programs would be given additional time to improve and to better serve their students.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">The proposed rule also increases transparency about gainful employment programs by requiring institutions to tell both current and potential students about key outcome measures, like debt, earnings, loan repayment rates, loan default rates, completion and withdrawal rates.\xc2\xa0 This information would identify those programs that best serve students and help them make more informed decisions about their educational investment.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Under our proposed rule, programs that don\xe2\x80\x99t pass the two-part accountability metrics -- how much debt former students have relative to their income, and how often they are defaulting -- would eventually become ineligible to provide federal student aid.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">To be clear, the majority of gainful employment programs out there today will pass these metrics.\xc2\xa0 High-performing institutions, where real training is leading to good jobs, see an opportunity here -- they can expand their programs and serve more students in more communities.\xc2\xa0 Success will be rewarded.\xc2\xa0 But today, too many programs, particularly those at for-profit colleges, will fail if they don\xe2\x80\x99t improve.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We are especially concerned about the students at these schools.\xc2\xa0 Of the students who are in the lowest-performing programs under our new metric, 98 percent of them are programs at for-profit institutions.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s more, students at for-profit colleges represent only about 13 percent of the total higher education population, but they make up 46 percent of all loan defaults.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And of the for-profit gainful employment programs that our department could analyze, and which could be affected by our actions today, the majority -- the significant majority, 72 percent, produce graduates who on average earned less than high school dropouts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">It\xe2\x80\x99s important that people understand these institutions are overwhelmingly taxpayer funded.\xc2\xa0 For-profit colleges can receive up to 90 percent of the revenue from taxpayer dollars, with the additional revenue on top of that frequently coming from veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits and private student loans.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the programs that would fall under this rule receive $21.6 billion in federal loans and $7.1 billion in Pell grants each year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s close to $30 billion every single year.\xc2\xa0 And over time, that number has been growing.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">To be clear, a program that leads to unaffordable debt and default isn\xe2\x80\x99t an opportunity, it\xe2\x80\x99s abuse.\xc2\xa0 We want to shine a light on the career programs that are doing good work, while making sure that students and consumers are aware of those that are not.\xc2\xa0 The regulation is designed to do six things.\xc2\xa0 First, make improved information about gainful employment programs available to consumers.\xc2\xa0 Second, result in higher-quality programs.\xc2\xa0 Three, lead to reduced costs and reduced student debt.\xc2\xa0 Four, result in higher earnings and a better return on educational investment for students, prospective students, and their families, as well as for taxpayers and the federal government.\xc2\xa0 Fifth, lead to the growth for high-performing institutions, and we want them to expand and create greater access and more opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And finally, eliminate the worst-performing programs.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">The proposed rule provides institutions with the opportunity to make immediate changes to avoid becoming ineligible for federal financial aid.\xc2\xa0 Institutions will have a transition period that takes into account any immediate reductions in cost for students or any improvements in the debt-to-earnings ratio for graduates.\xc2\xa0 For many institutions, every one of their gainful employment programs passes those proposed metrics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We want to see these high performing expand and serve more students, while we want to make sure that the ones that prey on students do not continue their abusive practices.\xc2\xa0 We want more, not fewer choices for Americans pursuing their career training, which they need to enter the middle class.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">In recent years, we have seen the rapid growth of enrollment and the rise of default rates at for-profit institutions.\xc2\xa0 These problems, and the widespread evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse, prompted President Obama to embark on a negotiation with the higher education community over new regulations.\xc2\xa0 The students at these programs, including many veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, enrolled in the hope of finding steady, well-paying careers, but too often they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get what they need and what they deserved.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they found confusing or blatantly misleading information, excessive costs, poor quality, low completion rates, and programs that provide training for low-wage occupations or, in some cases, where there simply aren\xe2\x80\x99t any jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">College must open up doors of opportunity, but students in these failing programs often ended up worse off than before they enrolled.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop there and take your questions.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, can you give us some aggregate numbers about the number of for-profit institutions you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about that would likely be ineligible if they stayed on the same path?\xc2\xa0 And how many students we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that some of the students are bad students?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Anything is possible, yes.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that part of the --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me just walk through the numbers. And to be clear, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about institutions, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about programs.\xc2\xa0 So this is at the programmatic level.\xc2\xa0 So institutions might have 10, 20, 50 different programs and widespread.\xc2\xa0 Some institutions, all of their programs are passing, some it\xe2\x80\x99s a mix, some not many.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So at the program level, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about roughly 8,000 programs and a total enrollment -- 4.5 million people.\xc2\xa0 And if things don\xe2\x80\x99t change, we anticipate about a quarter of those 8,000 programs failing.\xc2\xa0 But to be clear, we just looked at a one-year snapshot; we actually think there will be rapid improvement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen some pretty significant improvement in these past couple years.\xc2\xa0 And our hope is that many fewer programs will actually fail at the backend.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the call yesterday, I believe I heard that this would be -- this is a proposed regulation that you envision taking effect in 2016, is that correct?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll put this out, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get public comment, get feedback for the next 60 days, the next two month; take that feedback very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And if we go according to plan, this rule would go into effect July 2015, and then we would have results towards the end of 2016.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to some of your critics who would argue that ultimately this could wind up hurting some students by depriving them of the chance to get a higher learning opportunity?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So I think said six or seven times we want more opportunity, not less; we just want those to be high-quality opportunities.\xc2\xa0 And, again, many, many programs -- the majority of programs pass these metrics.\xc2\xa0 We want to see them grow, we want them serving more people.\xc2\xa0 We need this sector to do well.\xc2\xa0 We need more people -- often, these are folks who are struggling, trying to make their way up the economic ladder.\xc2\xa0 This has to be a path to the middle class.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So we want to expand opportunity, but it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be high-quality opportunity.\xc2\xa0 When that opportunity is leading to massive debt, when that opportunity is leading to massive default rates, that\xe2\x80\x99s not opportunity any of us can be proud of, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to people trying to climb the economic ladder, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to taxpayers, and, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s abusive.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Mr. Secretary, so you\xe2\x80\x99re issuing a \xe2\x80\x9cbuyer beware\xe2\x80\x9d warning, basically, about for-profit colleges?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even say \xe2\x80\x9cbuyer beware.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We just want much greater information out there.\xc2\xa0 These are hardworking, often single moms with two and three children trying to do the right thing; people going back to work, who want to go back to work who have been laid off.\xc2\xa0 We just want them to know what are graduation rates, what\xe2\x80\x99s my earning potential, what are debt rates, and just having clear information there.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We want to see good actors, great programs grow and expand to serve more folks, but where the wrong thing is happening for both people and taxpayers, we have a real problem with that.\xc2\xa0 Again, you go back to so many people coming out the backend with earnings less than high school dropouts -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not why people are investing their time and energy and resources.\xc2\xa0 Other places, this is an absolute chance to enter the mainstream, enter the middle class of America.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we want.\xc2\xa0 And so this is about being tough, being clear, but helping people improve as well.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What percentage of money did you say these for-profit institutions get from the federal government?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, this is important for people to understand.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the total number is roughly $30 billion, not quite that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been going up each year.\xc2\xa0 But let me be very clear:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to get up to 90 percent of their income from taxpayers and then many actually go well beyond that because there\xe2\x80\x99s an additional rule, which we understand, where veterans can take their benefits as well.\xc2\xa0 So you go up to the 90 percent threshold and then many go beyond that because they\xe2\x80\x99ve actively, actively recruited veterans.\xc2\xa0 And, again, when they\xe2\x80\x99re giving veterans a chance to be successful, that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic; when they\xe2\x80\x99re taking advantage of veterans, that\xe2\x80\x99s morally staggering to me.\xc2\xa0 But the overwhelming majority of their income comes from you and I and Jay -- from taxpayers.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re so unsuccessful or their track record is so poor, why do people continue to go into them?\xc2\xa0 Is it because they\xe2\x80\x99re -- basically the taxpayer is paying for it all?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been no accountability and there\xe2\x80\x99s been very little transparency, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been interesting to me -- you sort of look at this, these are for-profits; they have historically had no risk.\xc2\xa0 So all of their revenue comes from us as taxpayers, the overwhelming majority.\xc2\xa0 And whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re producing graduates who can be successful, there was no sense of accountability.\xc2\xa0 A pretty good business model, but not good for people and not good for taxpayers, not good for people doing it.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And, again, there are many players who are doing a fantastic job, doing it the right way, really helping people get real skills that lead to real jobs --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the for-profit sector?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Advanced manufacturing, IT jobs, health care jobs, green energy jobs.\xc2\xa0 We just want to see more of those -- we want to see those types of programs grow and thrive, but those that are being abusive, we think is just simply not fair to people struggling to improve and it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to us as taxpayers.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other on this.\xc2\xa0 So they can get up to 90 percent if they can get another --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 X percent.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the rest of it.\xc2\xa0 But, overall, this sector, this for-profit higher education, do you have an aggregate figure for how much money comes from the government?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s close to $30 billion.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, but the percentage.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Again, the vast majority go right up to that 90 percent.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The vast majority go up to -- wow, okay.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 And, again, many go beyond because of the veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re talking programs and not specific institutions, but can you cite any especially egregious offenders here who use these programs?\xc2\xa0 Is there anyone that really stands out?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in names.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said earlier, there are some institutions that every single one of their programs passed these metrics, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a really good thing.\xc2\xa0 There are other programs -- there are other institutions where very few or almost none passed these metrics, and there\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous spread -- there\xe2\x80\x99s everything in between.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And, again, we just want good players, good actors to grow and thrive, and we want bad actors to, frankly, go away.\xc2\xa0 And as folks here know, we\xe2\x80\x99re just not the only ones interested in this -- many states attorneys, attorney generals are looking at this in the most egregious situations.\xc2\xa0 So you could look at those cases or those complaints, criminal charges are involved here.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you\xe2\x80\x99re here with us, could you give us an update on the related program that the President announced last year for traditional colleges and universities, where he was going to create a rating system kind of like U.S. News?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Actually not like U.S. News, very different from U.S. News.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I stand corrected.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And lots of differences there and some pretty significant disincentives that are for good behavior we think in the U.S. News.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s a ranking system.\xc2\xa0 This is not a ranking system, this is a rating system.\xc2\xa0 We are still very early on thinking it through.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had dozens and dozens of meetings with higher-ed experts and students and faculty and presidents.\xc2\xa0 I was in Boston earlier this week, had some very productive meetings.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s tough, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to really think it through carefully.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll come out with a draft down the road a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Again, just like this, there will be a draft, we\xe2\x80\x99ll put public comment out, get public comment; we take that feedback very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re still in the early stages there, but spending a huge amount of time and energy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a fascinating body of work.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, I would like to ask you a variation of the question I asked the Chancellor of the New York State Higher Education System when she was here for your roundtable conference.\xc2\xa0 Do the rules that you\xe2\x80\x99re laying out, and standards, also apply to trade schools as well?\xc2\xa0 Are they included in the list of institutions of higher education?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, folks who are in the gainful employment space -- so for-profits, nonprofits, public/private community colleges -- it applies across the board.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that include metallurgical schools and agricultural schools?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know program by program, but I think so.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 James is much smarter than me, he says yes.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anyone else?\xc2\xa0 In the back.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to extend these rules to K-12?\xc2\xa0 For example, there are some surely bad actors in the K-12 sector, so what are you doing to push bad actors, as you say, to push bad actors out of the K-12 sector?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different sector, to be clear, and lots of things we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to try and improve that sector.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve invested billions of dollars to turn around low-performing schools.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s actually an amazing low-performing -- technical -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a longer conversation, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into it, but we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to turn around low-performing schools.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We would love to fix the No Child Left Behind law with Congress.\xc2\xa0 The law has been broken for a while, and unfortunately Congress is pretty dysfunctional.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve provided waivers to the vast majority of states in this country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re thinking through very positive accountability systems, looking way beyond test scores but looking at reductions in dropout rates, graduation rates, college-going rates, college perseverance, going to college, and not needing remedial classes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Overall, big picture, we\xe2\x80\x99re actually pretty pleased with the progress.\xc2\xa0 High school graduation rates are at all-time highs, 80 percent.\xc2\xa0 Dropout rates are down very significantly.\xc2\xa0 Over the past decade, Hispanic dropout rates have been cut in half.\xc2\xa0 African American dropout rates have been cut in half.\xc2\xa0 Their improvements are leading to higher high school graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 College enrollment rates are up; we have to make sure that translates into graduation rates, but some pretty positive trends there.\xc2\xa0 But we are challenging the status quo in unprecedented ways in historically underperforming schools.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have no plan to push bad actors out of the K-12 sector?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 No, to be very clear, we are investing north of $5 billion in the bottom 5 percent of schools in each state, and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing tremendous transformation.\xc2\xa0 And just, again, literally from this week -- amazing school, Worcester Tech, an amazing education to careers, a school in a community that\xe2\x80\x99s struggling.\xc2\xa0 This was one of the worst schools not just in Boston, the Boston area, but in the state of Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 A couple years later, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the highest-performing schools we have.\xc2\xa0 So that is one horrendous school, was absolutely transformed and turned around.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to see those kinds of efforts.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back, and then Jared.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, I wanted to ask about the geographic dispersion of how the impact might get as the efforts go forward to sort of ramp up these programs.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know sort of state by state or whatever it might be.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think many communities have good programs, many communities have bad programs, and we just want to see more good programs grow and flourish and expand.\xc2\xa0 And we want to see those bad programs, frankly, wherever they are, we want to see them either change and improve and do it with a sense of urgency, or we don\xe2\x80\x99t think as taxpayers it\xe2\x80\x99s a right thing to do to continue to fund them.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you\xe2\x80\x99re reluctant to name bad actors now at this point and you\xe2\x80\x99re being very deliberate over the timeline over the next few years.\xc2\xa0 For a veteran who is coming home this week, or for someone who\xe2\x80\x99s looking to transition to jobs this week, by the end of 2016 could have an associate\xe2\x80\x99s degree, is there any Department of Education information or any other information?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have a huge amount of information on our website and transparency and scorecards.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been interesting that, as we try to get more information -- again, we just think the truth is important; there\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty significant resistance to just sort of getting basic information out there.\xc2\xa0 So we think veterans deserve the best -- not just veterans, but everyone deserves the best.\xc2\xa0 We just want much more transparency around outcomes, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see everything from As to Fs and we want people to make informed choices.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And historically, honestly, what\xe2\x80\x99s driven much of this market has been marketing, and less on the results side.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m less interested in the marketing; I\xe2\x80\x99m more interested in where people are getting great results.\xc2\xa0 Real training leading to real jobs -- we want to see those grow.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the marketing budget or percentage spent on marketing a factor that you guys are putting into that --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been lots of public\xc2\xa0 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a longer conversation -- lots of public deliberations there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in outcomes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in outcomes.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, on this issue, I mean, is there also maybe a broader issue about whether too many colleges are making -- measuring success just by enrollment and graduation, and not making it a higher career-ready thing?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question; that actually goes back to the original question.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working on this rating system more broadly.\xc2\xa0 And this is an area where it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to critique all this, but I really challenge ourselves to be part of the solution.\xc2\xa0 So bigger picture -- each year, the federal government puts out about $150 billion in grants and loans, that\xe2\x80\x99s with a \xe2\x80\x9cB.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s all of our support.\xc2\xa0 And the overwhelming majority of that has been based upon inputs, not outcomes.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the President is asking us to look at and challenge, and over time have more resources go to those places that are doing a good job not just on access, which is important, but on completion.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">In the current budget that the President proposed for 2015 -- this has never happened; we would love to see it happen -- is additional dollars going to universities that are graduating Pell grant recipients.\xc2\xa0 So Pell grant recipients, often first-generation college-goers, more financial need, often more disadvantaged -- the goal is not to just have them enroll, the goal is to get that diploma at the backend.\xc2\xa0 So we want to do more in that space, and the President is challenging us to do better there.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, an unrelated question.\xc2\xa0 But the state of Indiana this week has moved to roll back Common Core Standards.\xc2\xa0 Could you comment on that at all?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 They absolutely have the right to do this.\xc2\xa0 This is a state-led effort; it always has been, always will be.\xc2\xa0 And whatever Indiana decides, we want to work with them to make sure that students have a chance to be successful.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, last one.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a briefing in about an hour on Capitol Hill on the Safe Schools Improvement Act, which would require schools to set up anti-bullying policies and report them -- report instances of bullying, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, to the federal government.\xc2\xa0 The administration has articulated support for this bill in the past.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how it should pass that legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Is this Congressman Polis\xe2\x80\x99s bill?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Linda Sanchez.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s two of them, but Linda Sanchez is the one \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know details of each one.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just a huge fan of Congressman Polis; I think he\xe2\x80\x99s worked so hard on these issues.\xc2\xa0 Not dissimilar to this conversation -- the more honest we are, the more transparent we are, the more we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the facts and trying to improve whatever they are.\xc2\xa0 We desperately need to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I worry tremendously not just about physical bullying, but about cyber bullying.\xc2\xa0 I worry that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have safe schools, children simply can\xe2\x80\x99t learn.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s certain fundamentals, certain foundational things.\xc2\xa0 Children have to be safe, they have to be fed, they have to be able to see the blackboard.\xc2\xa0 Their physical and social and emotional needs need to be met, and then we can talk about algebra, trig, and AP biology and chemistry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details, but whatever we can do to bring greater transparency, greater information, and share best practices, we have to protect kids.\xc2\xa0 One of the hardest parts of my jobs is meeting with parents who have lost their children due to both physical and cyber bullying.\xc2\xa0 And my wife and I have two young kids; that\xe2\x80\x99s something obviously no family, no parent should have to go through.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, Goyal.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what is the future of Obama-Singh Knowledge Initiative?\xc2\xa0 What are we still waiting on?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, his what initiative?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obama-Singh Knowledge Initiative that was signed between the two leaders here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And where do we stand?\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to bring a lot of jobs in the U.S. and will benefit both countries as far as the education system in both countries are concerned.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to follow up with you on details on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Thank you so much.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Secretary Duncan for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for your excellent questions.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, if you have questions on other subjects, let\xe2\x80\x99s try to answer them.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Josh.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A U.S. official has been saying that the Malaysian jet that disappeared may have been caused -- the disappearance may have been caused by a person, and it could have been an act of piracy.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that investigators \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s saying that?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A U.S. official.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which U.S. official?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That U.S. official has demanded anonymity to make that comment.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So what I can tell you is the Malaysian government is in the lead in this investigation, and U.S. air safety officials are in Kuala Lumpur working closely with the Malaysians on the investigation.\xc2\xa0 This is a difficult and unusual situation, and we are working hard, in close collaboration with the Malaysian government, to investigate a number of possible scenarios for what happened to the flight.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Our hearts of course go out to the families of the passengers who are in this agonizing situation.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, definitive conclusions still clearly cannot be drawn at this time.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. government is tracking the situation closely, and we are in communication across agencies and with international partners to provide any appropriate assistance we can in this investigation.\xc2\xa0 We are also continuing to participate actively in the search efforts.\xc2\xa0 We are consulting with our international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy, including to the new search areas to the West.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So to the extent that you have questions about what happened to that flight, I can assure you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have conclusive answers. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone does.\xc2\xa0 But we are participating with an array of international partners, assisting the Malaysian government in the effort to find out what happened to the plane and where it is.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know any more than any of us where the plane is, but is it among the possibilities that investigators are considering that the plane may have landed somewhere?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think for specifics about what we know and what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in the investigation, I would refer you to the FAA and the NTSB, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate about the scenarios that have been laid out there in the media or by people participating in the investigation, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of us or any of them has been able to reach a conclusion as to the whereabouts of the plane or to what happened to it.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, the President has been saying for a long time that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have it within his power to further ease deportations.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s confronted hecklers, but he\xe2\x80\x99s said even as recently as last week that he\xe2\x80\x99s already stretched his administrative ability pretty far.\xc2\xa0 Has the President changed his mind?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we announced last night is that the President met with Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman, Ruben Hinojosa; CHC Immigration Task Force Chair, Luis Gutierrez; and Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Xavier Becerra in the Oval Office last night.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">The discussion focused on their mutual efforts to pass common-sense immigration reform legislation through the House.\xc2\xa0 The President emphasized his deep concern about the pain too many families feel from the separation that comes from our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And he told the members that he has asked new Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, to do an inventory of the department\xe2\x80\x99s current practices to see how it, the department, can conduct it more humanely within the confines of the law.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">What the President has made clear, and what those speaking for him have made clear, is that he does not have the authority to achieve comprehensive immigration reform; only Congress can do that.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it is imperative that the House follow suit, take up a bill that is ready to go in the House that mirrors the principles that you see in the Senate bill that was passed with Democrats and Republicans that, in turn, reflects the principles the President has put on the table, so that this can become a reality and the President can sign it into law.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">There is no other way to fix all that is wrong with our immigration system.\xc2\xa0 What the President has asked Secretary Johnson to do is conduct a review of practices to ensure that within the confines of the law we are carrying out these policies in the most humane way possible, because he is very cognizant of the pain that families who are separated have been feeling as a result of deportations.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">But there is no fix here that does not include legislation.\xc2\xa0 That is why it is so important for the House to move forward, for the House to continue the progress that we saw earlier when leaders announced that they had settled on a set of standards and principles that would guide them in the effort to reform the immigration system comprehensively.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that Speaker Boehner has said very recently that it is important to move forward on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President could not agree more.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what changed between when the President said last week he\xe2\x80\x99s done everything he could do, and now when he\xe2\x80\x99s saying there might be other things that he can do, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fix?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that Secretary Johnson will conduct this review and look at our practices, and make sure that they are being engaged in and that the laws are being enforced in a way that is as humane as possible.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">What remains the case -- because we have obviously priorities when it comes to enforcement; they are border security and they are public safety.\xc2\xa0 And on the public safety end, that means making sure that we are using the resources we have, when it comes to enforcement, on ensuring that those with criminal records, convictions, are made a priority when it comes to detainment and deportation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what the Secretary will engage in when he looks at this review -- to ensure that the guidelines that are on the books, that reflect the laws that are on the books, are being followed and executed as well as possible, acknowledging all along, as the President has, that is it long past time that the House take up comprehensive immigration reform and pass it.\xc2\xa0 Because there is no doubt in my mind -- and I know that you all know this -- that if that bill were allowed to have a vote on the floor of the House, it would pass and it would pass with Democrats and Republicans, because neither party has a corner on understanding the importance of this issue or knowing that passage of comprehensive immigration reform would be a tremendous boon for our economy and our businesses and our security.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So this is just another reminder that Congress has to act, and we certainly hope that the House will do so as soon as possible.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Knowing that Republicans are actively looking for reasons to argue that the President has overreached, how concerned is the White House that by taking these steps you\xe2\x80\x99re actually making it less likely that the President will be able to sign an immigration bill?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Republicans in Congress ought to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 They know and we know that the way to fix the broken system is to do that, and that there is no executive action that this President or any President can take that would fix our immigration system comprehensively in the way that it must be fixed.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So I think that the House ought to, as the Speaker has said, take up this issue, acknowledge that it\xe2\x80\x99s serious, acknowledge that there are economic and security benefits to passing comprehensive immigration reform, take that argument to their districts and their states where we\xe2\x80\x99re confident it will be embraced, and let\xe2\x80\x99s get this done.\xc2\xa0 This is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for our security, and it\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, the right thing politically for the Republicans to take up.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they say they can\'t trust him to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t this play into that directly?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, if the Republican message is they refuse to reform our broken immigration system because they have an issue with the President, I think they ought to explain that to the American people.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">What the President has said is -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s made this very clear -- there is no substitute for legislation that fixes our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Congress ought to get about the business of passing that legislation.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has the President decided on what the cost will be for Russia once this referendum comes through?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Steve, is after the executive order was signed, teams in the government have been working on assessing possible actions that can be taken using the authorities that the executive order provides.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what Secretary Kerry said not long ago in London following his lengthy meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We have obviously not gotten to a situation where Russia has chosen to deescalate, where Russia has chosen a path of resolving this situation peacefully and through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 That is regrettable.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We will have to see how the next several days unfold.\xc2\xa0 I would note that Secretary Kerry mentioned that his counterpart said that President Putin is not prepared to make a judgment about or a decision about Ukraine until after the so-called referendum on Sunday takes place.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">That referendum, as Secretary Kerry, President Obama and so many others here in Washington and around the world have made clear is not legitimate, will not be legitimate.\xc2\xa0 Its results will not carry the weight of law because the referendum itself is inconsistent with and in violation of the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0 Russia has violated its commitments.\xc2\xa0 It has violated international law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We still hope that there is an avenue here that Russia will take in order to address its concerns in Ukraine in a manner consistent with international law, in a manner that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty late in the game here with regards to the situation in Crimea and this referendum on Sunday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a diplomatic solution looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not going to happen?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to pursue and remain open to a choice by Russia to resolve this diplomatically and engage in an effort to deescalate tensions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what happens tomorrow or Sunday, or into next week.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that as the Europeans have said, and Chancellor Merkel has said, we stand ready to respond should the referendum go forward on Sunday.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how quickly will you respond?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think without putting too fine a point on it, I\xe2\x80\x99d say quickly.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0Jim.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the missing flight, or missing plane, is there a sense within the White House that as this goes on, as it takes longer to solve this mystery, that the U.S. should step up its involvement?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I promise you that we are involved.\xc2\xa0 We have dedicated a lot of assets to the search effort.\xc2\xa0 We have engaged through the NTSB and the FAA onsite, as well as through officials from other agencies here in a collaborative effort with the Malaysian government and our international partners to try to find out what happened to this flight.\xc2\xa0 And that effort will continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">First and foremost, I think all of us who have been following this story can only imagine the agony that the family members of those passengers continue to suffer because of the lack of answers.\xc2\xa0 So we are focused on it, we are working with the Malaysian government, we are working with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 What we aren\xe2\x80\x99t engaged in, publicly, anyway, or anonymously, is in speculation about what might have happened.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with a whole host of authorities to try to find out what did happen.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President offered any thoughts on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening or has he been watching this?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s fully aware of it and has been briefed on it, and knows where things stand.\xc2\xa0 And he, too, is very concerned about the suffering that the families have to endure in a situation like this, and very concerned about the whereabouts of the plane.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s comments, he said that President Putin has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to weigh in on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Ukraine until after the referendum on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Might that be a potential diplomatic opening, not to disagree with Steve here, but maybe that President Putin is thinking about this?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate except to say that the time is certainly now, the time is right to decide to deescalate and deal with these challenges in this very tense situation in a manner consistent with international law, for Russian military personnel to return to bases and for the levels of Russian military personnel in Crimea to be reduced to ones consistent with agreements between the Ukrainian and Russian governments; and for Russia to engage in a dialogue with the Ukrainian government in partnership with members of the international community; and for Russia to avail itself of the offer being made here to send OSCE monitors into all parts of Ukraine to assess whether or not the rights of all Ukrainians are being adequately observed and protected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">That\xe2\x80\x99s the path out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the path that avoids transgression of international law, violation of a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the path that allows Russia to reverse a downward trend in its own economic situation, its markets and its economy and its currency; allows Russia to reverse a trend towards isolating itself within the international community.\xc2\xa0 And we hope Russia embraces that opportunity.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a Russian media report of a U.S. drone being intercepted over Crimea.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on immigration, you said something about -- and it was in the readout last night that Secretary Johnson will be looking at policies so that enforcement is pursued more humanely.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 That maybe perhaps special dispensation might be offered for families that are being broken up?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS, which is engaging in this review.\xc2\xa0 I think the point is, as I mentioned earlier, we have our very top priorities when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws, and that\xe2\x80\x99s border security and that\xe2\x80\x99s public safety.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to public safety, we have as our priorities targeting those with criminal records, those who have been convicted of crimes, violent crimes in particular, and that is what the guidelines say about what our priorities should be.\xc2\xa0 And the review I believe will assess how effectively those guidelines are being utilized on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And I just want to make clear that the President understands and is concerned about the pain caused by separations that have come about through deportation, but he also understands and has made clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s no comprehensive fix here that he can himself enact.\xc2\xa0 Congress has to act; the House has to follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead.\xc2\xa0 There is an array of benefits that comprehensive immigration provides, many of them could be argued -- could be described truthfully as conservative benefits when it comes to security and economic growth, and making sure that our businesses are all playing by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 This is something that everyone has and everyone on Capitol Hill should be able to embrace.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Jon.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the missing Malaysia Air flight, you mentioned the NTSB being involved -- of the United States helping in the search.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the military has moved assets in to help in that search process as well.\xc2\xa0 But are there also U.S. intelligence assets and U.S. counterterrorism personnel involved in investigating whether or not this was an act of terror?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a constant and ongoing interagency communication on this issue, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific about every individual from every agency that\xe2\x80\x99s participated in discussions about this or weighed in.\xc2\xa0 Our lead agencies are the NTSB and FAA, and the DOD through the assets that it\xe2\x80\x99s providing.\xc2\xa0 But everyone has been obviously engaged in a conversation and discussion and analysis about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here.\xc2\xa0 Malaysia has the lead in the investigation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a Malaysian airline flight that was lost, but we are assisting, as are many other nations, in every way that we can.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you answer -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll try one more time a little more directly.\xc2\xa0 Are we investigating -- is the United States government investigating whether or not this was an act of terrorism?\xc2\xa0 Is that part of what we are doing here?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling anything in or out, and we are, in our investigation, assessing all possible leads and potential scenarios that are plausible when it comes to what happened to this flight.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a way of --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that would be a yes.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is we\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling anything out.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not having conversations with our investigators.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re actively involved in the investigation in which the Malaysian government has the lead.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Ukraine, you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned before the visa ban obviously that was done at the time you started the process on sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how many individuals have been subject to that visa ban?\xc2\xa0 I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us names, but can you give me a number?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the State Department is able to do that, but I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then one last one.\xc2\xa0 This is the third anniversary of the beginning of the conflict in Syria, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been about a year and a half I think since we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered.\xc2\xa0 Do you still think Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is certainly our view that Bashar al-Assad, who has brutally murdered his own people routinely over far too long a period now, will never rule Syria again in the way that he did in the past.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people have made clear that they won\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate that.\xc2\xa0 The cost of his brutality has been enormously high.\xc2\xa0 And we have, with our international partners, engaged in a broad effort to assist the Syrian people through provision of humanitarian aid and to assist the opposition through a variety of forms of assistance to help it in its effort to achieve a better future for the Syrian people.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So the answer is the days when Assad could rule all of Syria and that Syrians would go along with that are over.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I assume when the President said I believe Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered, he meant that he would be out of power in Syria, period.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The conflict -- I take your point.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the conflict hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ended and that is a shame, and it is especially regrettable because the only resolution here is through a negotiated settlement, a political settlement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to press with our partners in this effort for the Geneva II process to continue, for a process that can lead to a transitional government and to a better and more democratic and prosperous future for Syria to be achieved.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that Assad continues to oversee an effort that crushes his own people and murders women and children is a terrible thing.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about it.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you still believe Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered?\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, the number would be --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe that his days are numbered?\xc2\xa0 And I assume that number would be -- everybody\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered, I guess in a larger sense, but --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well put.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President -- when the President said I believe Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered, the impression wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that he was still going to be in power a year and a half later, was it?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody is glad that Assad still has control over his military and some portions of his country and is using that control to slaughter other civilians -- Syrian civilians in other parts of his country.\xc2\xa0 That is a terrible thing indeed.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking if you\xe2\x80\x99re glad, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if you think he\xe2\x80\x99s still going to be there much longer.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make predictions about how long he will continue to have any kind of control over a military operation that\xe2\x80\x99s brutally murdering Syrian civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Yes, Major.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you go back, and come back to me?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A much lighter question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a bill headed to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk probably pretty soon that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to fund cancer research but also would eliminate public funding of the party conventions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to sign this bill -- H.R. 2019?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President is pleased to see that Congress has come together to pass legislation that aims to accelerate the search for cancer treatments for children, and he looks forward to signing the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act.\xc2\xa0 While the potential annual increase of nearly $13 million in children\xe2\x80\x99s research at NIH is beneficial, the President looks forward to working with Congress to make even greater strides towards accelerating lifesaving research and strengthening public health in the future.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We support this bill because its chief aim is increasing our investments in potentially life-changing and lifesaving children\xe2\x80\x99s research.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Yes, Major.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is great anxiety that after this referendum Putin may decide to use the troops that are now massing along the Ukrainian border to expand his area of influence eastward.\xc2\xa0 Are you prepared --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean westward, I think.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Westward, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, forgive me, westward.\xc2\xa0 Are you prepared to say something on behalf of the White House to warn Putin in no uncertain terms about the costs and what that would do to this particular crisis, which is already pretty significant?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There most definitely will be additional costs if Russia escalates this conflict rather than deescalates.\xc2\xa0 And they will be imposed by the United States, but also by our European partners who have made abundantly clear that they intend to take actions should Russia not engage in efforts to deescalate but rather take steps towards escalation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about any particular thing that might happen.\xc2\xa0 We are focused on efforts to avoid conflict, to avoid further escalation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging the Russians to move towards a dialogue with the Ukrainian government, move towards engaging with the international community, allowing international monitors into all of Ukraine so that they can make assessments about how the rights of Russian ethnics and all Ukrainians are being protected.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the proper path.\xc2\xa0 The Russian government, the Russian economy have already endured costs because of the violations the Russian state has engaged in by transgressing international law by violating Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 And there will certainly be further costs if Russia does not deescalate.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would agree that that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a hypothetical, that anxiety is genuine about that --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No question.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the threatening presence of the troops is of grave concern for everyone in the sovereign nation of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 If things do move westward, which appears to be a legitimate fear, does that in any way, shape, or form, open up the question of a possible Western military response?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about that.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that escalation would be --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should Russia know that that would change the character of this in a dramatic way?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Further escalation of any kind would result in costs to Russia.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to enumerate what those would be or attach costs to certain hypothetical actions.\xc2\xa0 I think Russia understands that the whole of the international community views what it has done in Ukraine thus far, in Crimea, as a violation of international law, a violation of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under the U.N. Charter, and obviously further escalation that demonstrates further disregard for a sovereign nation\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity would be viewed similarly.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for him to weigh in with Putin again directly?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know President Obama has spoken --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken on a number of occasions with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry has met and spoken with --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s been the main interlocutor.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying does the President think now --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- with his counterpart more times than I can count at this point.\xc2\xa0 So we have been actively engaged at the very highest levels with the Russian government, senior Russian officials, with our allies and partners and, very importantly, with the new Ukrainian government on these matters.\xc2\xa0 The President met with the Ukrainian Prime Minister just the other day, and as you know, Vice President Biden has been very engaged in this effort and meeting with and speaking with leaders in Ukraine and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So I don\'t have a conversation schedule to tell you about right now, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been fairly demonstrated that from the President on down we\xe2\x80\x99ve been directly engaged in this.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, let\xe2\x80\x99s try to cut to the chase.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret in the Latino community that there\xe2\x80\x99s been tremendous conversation with this administration about the deportation issue and a lot of pressure, both public and private, about getting a reassessment of the kind the President set in motion last night.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also well known that the threat of that reassessment has been communicated to House Republicans -- if they didn\'t move immigration reform, the President would engage possibly in this prosecutorial discretion on the nonDREAMer side of the deportation question.\xc2\xa0 Are you not sending a signal to the Hill, you better pick up the pace, because if you don\'t we have executive branch tools and we very well might use them, and you better reassess this slow walk in immigration?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 First, it is absolutely the case that this kind of review would not be necessary if Congress had passed and the President had been able to sign into law comprehensive immigration reform that fixed all the problems that have been identified and are addressed in that legislation.\xc2\xa0 What is also the case is that suggestions that the President has the authority through his executive power to achieve everything that that legislation would achieve are false and cannot happen.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but with the DREAMers -- it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that with discretion, decisions can be made that address the particular issue deportation has raised with those who have been lobbying this administration to take the same look there that you did with the DREAMers.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I can tell you, because I don\'t want to predict what --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you give them hope that that\'s going to happen.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict what the product of Secretary Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s review will be.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s reviewing existing policies to ensure that the immigration laws are enforced and administered effectively, sensibly, and in line with our traditions as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">But whatever the result of that review, I promise you it will not provide a substitute for the urgent need to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Congress has an opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 Congress, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, would be rewarded for doing that, by demonstrating its capacity to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass legislation that is sorely needed, as recognized by business leaders across the country, by labor leaders, by law enforcement leaders, by faith leaders, by a coalition the likes of which we rarely see when there is a much debated political issue here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 So this is an opportunity for Congress to show the American people that it can do something substantial in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that House Republicans will seize that opportunity.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last, you can\'t be as satisfied as the statement said last night about the unemployment insurance extension legislation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s five months; you wanted much longer than that. It requires pay-fors, which sets a precedent you said didn\'t necessarily have to stand.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the best you can do, an unhappy compromise, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have come together around an agreement to extend emergency unemployment benefits for the more than 2 million people now -- Americans who have been fighting every day to find a job.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has repeatedly called on Congress to take action on a compromise solution to extend this vital lifeline for millions of hardworking Americans.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And this is not just the right thing to do for these Americans looking for work; it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our economy, as economists have made clear.\xc2\xa0 The benefits of this legislation are felt directly and quickly in our economy.\xc2\xa0 And so we urge the Senate -- the President does -- to pass a bill -- the bill, and for the House to do the same so that he can sign it into law.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Look, the point we\xe2\x80\x99ve made and continue to make is that far often than not -- in fact, in the vast majority of occasions -- Congress has seen fit to extend emergency unemployment benefits without an offset because this is emergency assistance, and that was the point we have made all along.\xc2\xa0 We also urge Congress --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lost that argument.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we win here because we aggressively have been calling for extension of unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 That is vital for our economy and most vital for those, now, 2 million families.\xc2\xa0 We have called on Congress to find a compromise.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve never ruled out -- and certainly aren\xe2\x80\x99t now because we\xe2\x80\x99re embracing this progress -- the fact that there could be a compromise.\xc2\xa0 But the point we were making in the past and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make in the future, if necessary, is that the argument that there had to be an offset was belied by the fact that President George W. Bush signed on more than one occasion an extension of the very same benefits, absent offsets.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the deportation issue, you\xe2\x80\x99ve set up a couple of times today a straw man --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, by saying -- by suggesting that there\xe2\x80\x99s no way in which any action that he could take could solve all of the problems that a comprehensive immigration bill would solve, which is not at all --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Moral majority.\xc2\xa0 The thing is there is no substitute here for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And suggestions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that there is some action he could take that would resolve this issue are simply not the -- are not accurate.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are some people who make that suggestion.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying there are not.\xc2\xa0 But many of the suggestions that activists and now the lawmakers that have been through the White House in the last couple of days have suggested is not it could solve everything, but is there some discrete -- some other discrete steps that you could take akin to the DREAMers, like, for example, could you carve out the parents of DREAMers as one subset?\xc2\xa0 Could you carve out another subset of people that might be a discrete group that would still fall within the phrase confines of the law but would both be a signal to the community that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing something, and also substantively improve the lives of people that would no longer be deported?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And I guess the question is -- without sort of the answer about, like, well, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t solve everything -- does the President hope that this review comes back and either -- and concludes from the DHS or from his own lawyers that, yes, there are additional subsets or additional groups that you could do something with?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I lost track of what the question is.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I kind of guess what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, the President has asked Secretary Johnson, who was already engaged in this effort, to review the implementation of existing laws and to do so in a way that looks very closely at how the laws are being implemented with regard to our top priorities, which are border security and public safety, and to make sure that the implementation of the law is being carried out in a way that is mindful of the fact that we have a tradition here -- or traditions here that is a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants and that there is pain being caused here to families.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Having said that, without predicting what the outcome of the review will be, what is absolutely the case is that this review will not produce a solution that obviates the need in any way for comprehensive immigration reform to be passed.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">The opposite is true, as I said earlier when I was asked this, I think by Major, one thing we can say is that if the House would follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and pass comprehensive immigration reform, it\xe2\x80\x99s highly unlikely that we would have to conduct a review like this.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason why comprehensive immigration reform is so important and why it needs to be comprehensive, so that it can address not just all the undocumented people in the country but the enhanced security issues with visas for students who come here and we want to stay so they\xe2\x80\x99ll start business here, and matters involving making sure that businesses across the country are playing by the same set of rules.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So there are a lot of things that need to be addressed, and our hope is that Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t block progress here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the country\xe2\x80\x99s interest most importantly.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the economy\xe2\x80\x99s interest, equally importantly.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s interest to demonstrate to the American people that they can get this done, and we hope they will.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0 Just to ask --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Geez, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said almost everything I can.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to restate that whole thing, you can just --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ah, I forgot my water.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President\xe2\x80\x99s concern about inhumane treatment seems to focus on the separation of families. Is that part of Secretary Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s charge, to look at ways to reduce specifically that?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Johnson is doing, and what the President has asked him to continue doing in a formal way is to review or do an inventory of DHS\xe2\x80\x99s current practices to see how it can conduct enforcement more humanely.\xc2\xa0 And the President singled out the issue of family separations as one that obviously causes pain to too many families.\xc2\xa0 But this is all something that falls into an approach that is undertaken within the confines of existing law.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">And the guidelines that we have which set priorities -- border security and public safety -- and within the context of public safety, it sets a priority on targeting convicted criminals, violent criminals, and making sure that they\'re removed because they pose the greatest threat in the country.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not a priority on keeping families together?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the point of the guidelines is to ensure that the resources we have are focused on those priorities, and that in carrying out the implementation of the policy we are mindful of the need to do so humanely.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just speak to the timeline too?\xc2\xa0 Was there a time certain?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timeline associated with it.\xc2\xa0 This is a review that\'s being conducted at DHS, so I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Yes, Doug.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the subject of Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s press conference -- he used an interesting term, a curious term to me -- \xe2\x80\x9chooliganism\xe2\x80\x9d -- to describe some of the unrest that\'s being fomented in three Eastern Ukraine cities.\xc2\xa0 Hooliganism implies a certain spontaneity, randomness.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times this morning used a very different description of it, citing reports that Russians are being bussed across the border into these three Eastern Ukraine cities under the direction of Russian intelligence forces to foment this kind of agitation.\xc2\xa0 Have you verified that those reports are correct?\xc2\xa0 Which is hooliganism?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information that can further elucidate that report.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction between the way Secretary Kerry described what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Eastern Ukraine and what you just reported.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not confirming how these incidents have come about or how they\'re being directed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that the kinds of pretext that may be created or aimed at trying to stir up a conflict are ones that have a lot of historical precedent and we\'re keeping a very close eye on.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen throughout this very tense situation is a Ukrainian government that has shown tremendous restraint and exercised extreme caution and responsibility in dealing with a very difficult situation.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously encourage them to continue to do that.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">But I don\'t have anything more on reports of the nature that you just described except that we are very concerned about the prospect for any kind of violent conflict that the situation in Ukraine might devolve into.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that note, Lavrov said that they have no intention of a military intrusion in Eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Given that Russia has already denied the presence of its own special forces in Crimea, why should they believe -- we believe when it comes to Eastern Ukraine?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'re obviously monitoring things very closely.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t believe, in other words?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not predicting the future.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is we\'re going to look and see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and what happens, because, obviously, as Doug points out, descriptions by Russian leaders of what has happened in Crimea are starkly at odds with the facts and have been consistently for many days now.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on that -- has there been any reconsideration at all of resurrection of a missile defense shield in Poland, Czech Republic, Lithuania?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have a very robust missile defense program, as I guess you know, and we continue to work with our partners and allies on it.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to this issue and this conflict between Ukraine and Russia, perpetrated and instigated by Russia, we are interested in de-escalation and we are dedicating a lot of effort to trying to persuade Russia to avail itself of an opportunity to address its concerns in Ukraine in a way consistent with international law, with the partnership of the international community and international monitors.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to the question about the timeline.\xc2\xa0 I know you don\'t have a specific date, but did President Obama not say, can you get back to me in a couple months with this review, or a year --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more on a timeline for you.\xc2\xa0 The review is being conducted by Secretary Johnson, so DHS might have more specifics.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And going back to Ukraine, obviously we heard some strong language from Chancellor Merkel yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama gotten any assurances from his European partners that sanctions will go into effect almost immediately if the referendum does go through on Sunday?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there has been a lot of consistency in the way that the United States and our European partners have viewed the situation in Crimea and Ukraine in general, and in the actions that we believe together have been necessary to take in response to the violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and, obviously, steps that we would take quickly should there be an escalation in that conflict.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">I would point you to what Chancellor Merkel has said publicly and what other leaders have said publicly when it comes to steps that might be taken as soon as Monday should the scheduled referendum take place.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to Chancellor Merkel today, since her remarks?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any other foreign leader communications to read out to you today besides, obviously, the Prime Minister of Ireland who\xe2\x80\x99s here.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to sanctions here, there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously legislation pending in both chambers, and one of the things that\'s holding up the legislation in the House is this IMF quota increase.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Republicans are saying that they could get on board with this if that were dropped.\xc2\xa0 Given the enormity of the situation, given the referendum that\'s going to pass, the increased presence of troops along the Ukrainian border, does President Obama think that that should be dropped and that the legislation should be passed without it?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we support what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the Senate and we commend Senators Menendez and Corker for passing Ukraine legislation out of their committee on Wednesday with a strong bipartisan vote -- 14 to 3.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t see that every day, especially in this Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And I think that reflects the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike -- or at least a substantial number of Republicans in the Senate understand that in addition to the direct assistance the United States can provide and that the administration wants Congress\xe2\x80\x99s help in providing to Ukraine, passing IMF quota reform, which has been long delayed, is vital to ensuring that the IMF can lend resources on a scale that Ukraine needs to regain its financial footing.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So there is a direct connection between passing IMF quota reform as part of this package and providing additional support to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So the broad bipartisan concern that lawmakers have on the Hill about the situation in Ukraine, the consensus that has taken hold up there around the idea that the United States ought to be doing what it can and everything it can when it comes to providing that assistance and making sure that Ukraine is able to regain its financial footing, suggests that the right thing to do is to pass a bill that includes IMF quota reform.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">My understanding is that Senator Reid filed cloture on the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s Ukraine bill and the Senate plans to consider it when members return from recess next week.\xc2\xa0 And we support legislation that includes IMF quota reform because it\'s the right thing to do generally and because it provides additional means for the IMF to give support to Ukraine.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, at this point, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear as though you will be able to get it through both chambers.\xc2\xa0 So given the resistance that you\'re hearing on the Hill, given the resistance that you\'re hearing from Democrats and Republicans, in some cases, do you think, in order to move this through quickly, that the President would consider dropping it?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we support legislation that includes bolstering the IMF in its capacity to lend to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has moved that forward out of committee.\xc2\xa0 We support that. We urge the Senate -- full Senate to pass it and for the House to do so as well if, in fact, they share our concerns, which we believe they do, about the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those who say the IMF has assistance programs that would allow enough funding?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the \xe2\x80\x9cenough\xe2\x80\x9d is the issue here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the IMF has assistance programs.\xc2\xa0 But what is also true is that the IMF has not seen passage of these quota reforms out of the United States now for a number of years; they ought to be passed because passing those reforms would expand the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to provide assistance and loans to Ukraine.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Jared.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that sanctions could come quickly --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Both Jareds.\xc2\xa0 You first.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you -- could come quickly, as soon as Monday.\xc2\xa0 Russia will likely respond with actions against economic, military and diplomatic interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 What does the administration anticipate?\xc2\xa0 What are we ready for in terms of a counterpunch?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how to answer that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously focused on efforts to resolve the situation in Ukraine diplomatically and persuading Russia to avail itself of a means through the international community to address its concerns in Ukraine and make sure that ethnic Russians are having their rights observed and protected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Look, when we look at sanctions, as a general matter, we look at the consequences of imposing them.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly the case here.\xc2\xa0 But the actions we\'ve taken through the executive order -- the visa bans and other measures that we\'ve taken already -- they reflect our belief that that\'s the right policy to pursue given the circumstances created by Russian actions in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not alone here.\xc2\xa0 Europe has indicated the same posture.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">So I\'m not going to speculate about what reaction there might be if, in fact, the action you describe takes place on Monday or soon thereafter.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously monitoring all the situations and examining how any scenario might play out.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate and are you prepared for actions like effects to the North Distribution Network, additional actions taken against American companies, diplomatic pressure on Iran and Syria?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about, certainly, what another government might do.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you -- or do -- is point you to statements by the Russian government when it comes to their continued support for the P5-plus-1 process and for the effort to rid the Assad regime of its chemical weapons and the responsibilities that the Russian government has in that process.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">On other matters, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Jared, I owe it to you, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a week in review.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know the week in review.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If Bill Plante were here I\xe2\x80\x99d play that video.\xc2\xa0 That would be pretty good.\xc2\xa0 Has everybody seen it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I saw it.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s playable for -- on family television.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Jared.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick one, what does the President hope to get out of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Mr. Abbas?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will discuss progress made with President Abbas, as he did with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 He will commend President Abbas, as he did Prime Minister Netanyahu, on the tough decisions that each leader has made thus far in an effort to move the process forward.\xc2\xa0 He will speak of the need to establish a framework for negotiations going forward and the need to -- as that takes place, for additional tough decisions to be taken so that we can see a resolution to a conflict that\'s been going on for a long, long time and that results in two states -- a Palestinian -- a sovereign Palestinian state and a secure, democratic, Jewish state of Israel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We hope that we will see progress.\xc2\xa0 This has been a very difficult issue for a long, long time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that Secretary Kerry and President Obama have engaged in directly.\xc2\xa0 We are doing everything we can as a partner to both Israelis and Palestinians in trying to help them move forward in this difficult process.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Thanks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Week ahead -- not in review -- begins this way:\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will welcome Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to reviewing with President Abbas the progress in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations -- I could have just read this and not answered your question.\xc2\xa0 They will also discuss our continuing effort to work cooperatively to strengthen the institutions that can support the establishment of a Palestinian state.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we and many others have worked with President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority in doing.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">On Tuesday, the President will award 24 Army veterans the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry.\xc2\xa0 These veterans will receive the Medal of Honor in recognition of their valor during major combat operations in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\xc2\xa0 This event will be held here at the White House.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">In the evening, the President will attend a DNC event here in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">On Wednesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">On Thursday, the President will travel to Orlando, Florida for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Following this event, he will travel to Miami, Florida to attend DNC and DCCC events.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">I feel bad because you had your hand up, Jessica.\xc2\xa0 Did you have anything --</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 One of the readouts came out of the Lavrov-Kerry meeting, and Lavrov said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make any moves until after the referendum.\xc2\xa0 Is that too late?</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly too late with regards to the referendum, which we believe is not valid because it doesn\'t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not legal under the Ukrainian constitution.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage with Russia in an effort to see Russia deescalate and resolve this conflict in a manner that\'s consistent with international law, that honors the integrity of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territory and its sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in that process.\xc2\xa0 We would like to have seen Russia avail itself of the off-ramp that the international community has built here already, but we certainly will continue in an effort and remain open to a diplomatic resolution to this conflict.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p style="margin-left: auto">END<br/>\n\t2:38 P.M.
