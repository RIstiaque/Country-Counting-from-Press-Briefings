Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t2:35 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let everyone get settled.\xc2\xa0 Today, ahead of the 2012 hurricane season, which begins on Friday, June 1st, the President was briefed by Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security John Brennan, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano, FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and others on actions already taken by the administration, working with states and communities in hurricane-prone states to ensure we are prepared for the season.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the briefing, the President also heard from the Department of Energy, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NOAA, as well as the State of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Management Team and a private sector utility representative from Florida Power and Light.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe briefing highlighted lessons learned from disasters ranging from Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall in the southeast United States 20 years ago this summer and remains the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history, as well as more recent events, including responses to the Joplin tornado and Hurricane Irene last year.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere was also a discussion of steps taken to incorporate lessons learned from major power outages caused by severe weather.\xc2\xa0 The President asked his team to keep him updated on any unmet needs as the season progresses, and thanked them all for their efforts.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI was able to attend the meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was fascinating.\xc2\xa0 But I brought along with me today a person far more capable of answering your questions as the hurricane season begins.\xc2\xa0 With me is FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is if -- as we do traditionally, if you have questions for him, address them to him at the top, and then when you are done and finished with those questions, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let him leave and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for other issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that, I give you Mr. Fugate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Just real quickly, some of the things the President was asking about -- lessons learned -- particularly, we saw earlier this -- a couple weeks ago, as he attended the graduation at Joplin and lessons from Hurricane Andrew or Katrina is, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get debris picked up quickly, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not able to restore public infrastructure, particularly get schools open, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for communities to come back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so, again, applying those lessons, realizing that Joplin was a city, but hurricanes can be much larger; the need to get in quickly, to support and stabilize the governor and local officials.\xc2\xa0 But really, key things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned and reinforce with Joplin -- you got to get the debris out so people can rebuild.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get schools open so that children can get back to their routines.\xc2\xa0 And you need to look at this from the standpoint of what the entire team brings together, not just what government does.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPrivate sector is a key component.\xc2\xa0 Without jobs, without services it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for communities to reestablish and be able to recover.\xc2\xa0 So again, we continue to work on those efforts and we continue to encourage people to get ready for hurricanes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned about the intensity of this hurricane season?\xc2\xa0 And then, also, what has been learned in terms of all the different agencies communicating -- the flow of information between all the agencies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, the seasonal outlook -- I believe the National Weather Service and NOAA put out theirs calling for an average season.\xc2\xa0 Of course, hurricane season starts June 1st and we still have a tropical depression -- the second named storm of the season.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnless you\xe2\x80\x99re in the reinsurance business, the seasonal forecast has very little meaning for any actions that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take -- because what the seasonal forecast doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us is where we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a landfall hurricane; 2010 was one of the most active hurricane seasons -- no major landfall hurricanes have hit the United States.\xc2\xa0 Irene, last year, impacted -- was one of the few landfall hurricanes in the last couple of years.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the real message about that is, if you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a seasonal forecast, it must be time for hurricane season -- get ready.\xc2\xa0 But for individuals and most businesses, the seasonal forecast shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change anything, because there\xe2\x80\x99s never a forecast that says there will be no hurricanes, and there is no forecast yet that says where they\'re going to hit or not hit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if you live along the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic and as far inland as the folks in Vermont found out last year, you need to be prepared for this hurricane season.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Director, two major gatherings this summer in the peak of hurricane season, Tampa, the Republican convention; Charlotte for the Democrats -- what special contingencies and plans are you looking at for those two gatherings?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, as far as us, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at this as we would any of the events that would lead to a state response.\xc2\xa0 However, the states themselves have done a lot of work and planning.\xc2\xa0 These are national security events, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of planning that goes into them beyond just hurricane, so it\xe2\x80\x99s the all-hazard approach.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would reference to the state of Florida specifically doing their statewide hurricane exercise focused on a hurricane occurring during the RNC.\xc2\xa0 So we support this as a national security event.\xc2\xa0 We support the all-hazards approach.\xc2\xa0 The governors and their teams have been doing more specific planning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When hundreds of thousands of people perhaps are gathered in one place, are there any special precautions?\xc2\xa0 Or is this more or less unprecedented?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Are you familiar with Miami, Tampa and tourism?\xc2\xa0 They always have large numbers of people.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So again, not to be flip, but the fact that you have the conventions there, there are decisions the conventions have to deal with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut as far as having additional people visiting during hurricane season, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of all planning to allow for if you got special events, if you got large gatherings, if you have conventions, to build these into your local and state evacuation plans.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a numerical increase, but it is something that you plan for -- irregardless of what the function is, you plan for what happens if you have larger numbers of people, how does that affect your evacuation lead times.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, that does not get into any of the details the actual conventions have as far as their decision-making, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll defer to them.\xc2\xa0 But for the evacuation purposes, you merely add the population increases just like you would for any other event that would occur during your evacuation timeframes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Is there some type of national interface on housing for those who are displaced from major storm systems that hit communities?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Probably one of the lessons we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from Andrew and then most recently Katrina, that in a large-scale catastrophic disaster we have lots of housing loss.\xc2\xa0 Many people are going to have to leave the area in the immediate short term to get better long-term housing.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve been working much better at coming up with and working with both our partners at HUD, but also with the private sector on available rental properties and other facilities that may be available outside of the area of impact, and then make these available to disaster survivors as potential options if they wish to relocate out of that as part of the FEMA temporary housing program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as far as a timeline, since we\'re not so far away from 2010, you said that was one of the worst seasons -- storm seasons that you\'ve seen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, it was just a lot of activity, not a lot of landfalls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, since it was a lot of activity, what would you say to Americans this season, especially now that you\'re saying that we\'ve had two storm systems already and June 1st hasn\'t even come yet?\xc2\xa0 What would you say to the average American right now as we\'re seeing activity that\xe2\x80\x99s begun before the hurricane season has begun?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Have a plan.\xc2\xa0 What I hate to have people do is go through hurricane season worrying all year about hurricanes.\xc2\xa0 What I want them to do is find out about their risk, take the appropriate steps to get ready, and then if a hurricane threatens, know what to do.\xc2\xa0 And for some folks, that means they\'ll have to evacuate away from the most dangerous areas; for other people, they need to be prepared for the impacts of the hurricane.\xc2\xa0 One of the big ones, besides flooding, is power outages.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think we always worry about the storms.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to worry.\xc2\xa0 I want them to be prepared.\xc2\xa0 I want them to have a plan, and know what to do if the storm threatens.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s our message every year going into hurricane season.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know this sounds very elementary, but when you say be prepared, some people don\xe2\x80\x99t think about, I guess, the electricity component and phones versus the cell phones with electricity; power versus the landline -- the old landlines that used to dial up.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to us about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 And we have actually learned this.\xc2\xa0 Remember when we had the earthquake here last year and everybody got on their cell phones at the same time and nobody could get through?\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we went with the FCC and we put together something -- and you can go to Ready.gov, and it\'s called Tech Ready -- and what it did, it incorporated all the lessons we learned about how we need to make sure that when there\'s a big crisis, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to call people on your phones; text message -- it\'s a lot faster and gets through.\xc2\xa0 Use social media to update people so you can let a lot of people know than trying to call everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd also, be prepared when power outages occur how you\'re going to keep your electronic devices charged.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen this, where oftentimes, the wireless community can get up and be operational, but if you evacuate and you forget your chargers and your phone dies, or if you\'re without power not knowing how to charge things.\xc2\xa0 So we went and put together a lot of information just focused on your mobile devices, wireless communications, things you need to do.\xc2\xa0 The fact that many people no longer have a landline, they only have wireless communication, and they need to make sure that they take the steps to make sure they\'re ready for that, but also realize that you\'re going to have a lot of congestion and difficulties getting through so you want to have backup plans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if you just did one thing this hurricane season, make sure you\'ve got a good family communication plan and what your backups are going to be, so when you get on that cell phone and you get that busy signal you\'re not stuck, you know what the next step is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Early warning measures -- after Irene last year, it came out that some of the budgetary plans that might -- that were considered, might eliminate funding for early warning measures, like what was saving lives in Kansas a month and a half ago, and hurricanes last year.\xc2\xa0 Are there any budgetary plans in place, or is there any concern by FEMA at this point that we might eliminate early warning measures?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Specifically, what early warning measure?\xc2\xa0 Because we\'ve got a whole lot of new stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s rolling out this year as we speak.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess my question is more about budgetary plans that are being considered by Congress and proposed by the White House.\xc2\xa0 What are you looking at in terms of funding for the existing early warning measures that you have and these new ones that you\xe2\x80\x99re excited about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not excited about it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s happened, and I\xe2\x80\x99m real excited that it happened.\xc2\xa0 We have been working on the Emergency Alert System, trying to move past just broadcast media.\xc2\xa0 And although we still heavily leverage broadcast radio and television and the NOAA weather alert radios, this year, in partnership with the wireless industry, through the rule-making authority of the FCC, we\xe2\x80\x99re rolling out the cellular access program where we\xe2\x80\x99re now able to broadcast to cell phones that are being upgraded to the system.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that has been a huge evolution that as your cell phones are upgraded and as people get new cell phones, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get warnings in a push system that will come out as part of the Emergency Alert System, what we call the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System.\xc2\xa0 And so, for the first time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually now -- are rolling out -- have implemented the technology nationwide to begin pushing alerts to cell phones.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question was about funding, though.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 That\'s just it.\xc2\xa0 What specifically?\xc2\xa0 Because we are funded to do these programs and to continue rolling out and improving these systems.\xc2\xa0 So there may be local systems that aren\xe2\x80\x99t being funded.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about that.\xc2\xa0 I know that from our standpoint the funding that we are putting into the Integrated Public Warning Alert System and those programs are funded, and we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward with deploying those systems.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Director, it seems there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more tornado activity in a lot more places.\xc2\xa0 Do you see increased activity -- looking historically -- to hurricanes today?\xc2\xa0 And do you attribute any of that to global warming?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a meteorologist.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a climate scientist, and hurricanes are cyclic.\xc2\xa0 I do know history.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at history and you look at hurricane activity, there are periods of increased and decreased activity that occurs over decades.\xc2\xa0 Throughout the \xe2\x80\x9860s, \xe2\x80\x9870s, early \xe2\x80\x9880s, up until about \xe2\x80\x9995, the Atlantic was actually in a period of below average activity, even though you had significant storms like Andrew, Frederic, and David.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBeginning about 1995, we saw an uptick in activity that has been sustained, and about the only variation is whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ve had El Ni\xc3\xb1os or La Ni\xc3\xb1as, depending upon that for a factor.\xc2\xa0 But if you look back for the amount information we have going back to about 1850s, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a cycle, and it\xe2\x80\x99s over decades of increased activity and decreased activity.\xc2\xa0 And so that cycle has been there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs far anything driving that, I\xe2\x80\x99d really defer to climate scientists.\xc2\xa0 But the reality is the history says we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this period of activity, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a period of quiet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a period of activity, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a period of quiet.\xc2\xa0 And so what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is not what we -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this in history before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, well, thank you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we get landlines again?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Huh?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we get landlines?\xc2\xa0 Should they start making landlines again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 No, make sure you have a charger for your cell phones.\xc2\xa0 And preferably, make sure you got something that you can charge it with a battery -- little battery chargers -- just in case you don\'t have power.\xc2\xa0 And add to your evacuation kits your cell phone chargers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing -- and this is again, time and time again, oftentimes, wireless communication is coming up as fast as the wireline communications.\xc2\xa0 So again, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to have a phone system.\xc2\xa0 But since most people -- and a lot of people now are going totally to a wireless; they don\'t have a landline at all in their homes -- make sure you have emergency power and the ability to charge it when the power is out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 With that, I will go to questions on other matters.\xc2\xa0 Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Syria, and in lobbying the Russians, how receptive is Moscow to the President\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it hurts Russia\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in the world community that they\'re perceived as friendly to the Assad regime?\xc2\xa0 And can -- could potentially the Russians play a similar role in Syria as the U.S. played in Yemen to negotiate Assad\xe2\x80\x99s exit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are certainly speaking with the Russians, as well as other members of the United Nations Security Council about Syria.\xc2\xa0 We were very clear about our disappointment of the veto exercised by both Russia and China on the resolution regarding Syria, calling on Assad to cease and desist from his brutal campaign against his own people.\xc2\xa0 And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times and others have, we are in regular consultations with Russians -- with the Russians and others about what we are seeing happening in Syria, and the need to put further pressure on the Assad regime, the need to isolate the Assad regime further, and to bring about the political transition that Syrians so desperately deserve and desire.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI won\xe2\x80\x99t speak for any other government.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that it is our belief, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the belief that we express in these conversations, that supporting the Assad regime is placing oneself or one\xe2\x80\x99s nation on the wrong side of history.\xc2\xa0 Assad will be remembered forever for what he did this past weekend and what he has done for the past 15 months.\xc2\xa0 He squandered an opportunity to preside over a political transition that would improve the position of Syria in the international community, and most importantly, improve the lives of his citizens.\xc2\xa0 And that will not change.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it is certainly our belief that as events progress in Syria and as we continue to consult with members of the Security Council and other nations, including, of course, nations who are part of the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d that we will make the argument that more action needs to be taken to pressure and isolate the Assad regime, to hold it responsible for what it has done.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen, there has been further action taken today in terms of sanctions against another bank.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is a process that involves a number of steps towards an end -- steps like the ones that were taken yesterday in coordination with other nations that resulted in the expulsion of Syrian diplomats from a number of countries; steps that have, for many months now, increased the isolation and pressure of and on the Assad regime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of an obstacle does the administration view the Russians -- and to some degree, the Chinese, too -- but the Russians in particular on achieving anything with the Annan plan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Annan plan is broadly supported by the United States and other members of the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is Assad\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to comply with the Annan plan despite the fact that he promised he would.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe question I think you\xe2\x80\x99re asking is, what -- if the Annan plan ultimately does not succeed, if Assad does not abide by it, does not cease firing and withdraw his forces, what then are the next steps, and what kinds of consultations will we have and are we having with other countries regarding possible next steps?\xc2\xa0 And clearly, those consultations are with many countries, including Russia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t preview for you what -- or speculate for you what might be included in next steps.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to work with a number of nations on this issue and continuing to shine a spotlight on the appalling, depraved behavior of the Assad regime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On one other subject.\xc2\xa0 The Polish Prime Minister says he\xe2\x80\x99s not completely satisfied with the White House explanation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Polish death camps.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to call Prime Minister Tusk and offer an explanation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President misspoke.\xc2\xa0 He was referring to Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, we regret the misstatement and that simple misstatement should not at all detract from the clear intention to honor Mr. Karski, and beyond that, all those brave Polish citizens who stood on the side of human dignity in the face of tyranny.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn several occasions, including his visit last year to the Warsaw Ghetto memorial, his remarks at the Holocaust Museum just last month, and his video message at the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, President Obama has paid tribute to the terrible loss of innocent Poles in Nazi death camps during the Holocaust.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, we regret the misstatement, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was.\xc2\xa0 It was a misstatement, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to see this in the context of awarding this medal in honor of the remarkable bravery of Mr. Karski and other brave Polish citizens who stood on the side, as I said, of human dignity in the face of the 20th century\xe2\x80\x99s most terrible tyranny.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Starting with Syria, has the President\xe2\x80\x99s new Atrocities Prevention Board met to consider a response to the Syrian crisis, particularly since the Houla massacre?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, has the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s new Atrocities Prevention Board, which he actually announced at the Holocaust visit, has it met?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 Then the second thing I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try on is the eurozone, which seems to gathering speed -- the crisis, which seems to be gathering speed.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about how the President is monitoring the situation there -- if he has spoken with any European leaders in the last few days to discuss the steps that are being taken to restore confidence?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations involving the President to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past and it continues to be true, he is in frequent contact with his European counterparts.\xc2\xa0 He, as you know, recently hosted European leaders and others at the G8 at Camp David as well as, of course, at the NATO Summit in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 The eurozone crisis was very much a topic of conversation, especially at the G8, and those conversations continue, both at the highest levels as well as at the level of the Secretary of Treasury and other officials -- Lael Brainard from Treasury and others.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as I think the President has made clear, we view this as a matter of concern.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have spent so much time consulting with and advising our European friends on it.\xc2\xa0 We bring to those consultations a certain amount of wisdom through experience that we hope our European allies and friends find helpful as they chart their course.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the Europeans have it within their own capacity to solve this, resolve this crisis.\xc2\xa0 They have taken some important steps.\xc2\xa0 They have embraced some important reforms.\xc2\xa0 But much more needs to be done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney today said that the administration has been \xe2\x80\x9csitting on the back burner\xe2\x80\x9d and leading from behind while the situation in Syria becomes unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 Your reaction?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply make clear that the President and the United States have led on Syria as he and we have led throughout the upheaval known as the Arab Spring.\xc2\xa0 I think perhaps not this critic but others of the same ilk use that phrase to criticize the President with regards to Libya.\xc2\xa0 I think history will demonstrate that the course of action the President took in that specific instance was the right one.\xc2\xa0 And I think that every one of these situations that have arisen within the Arab Spring demands a different response because of the different circumstances that surround them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this on a number of occasions when I\xe2\x80\x99m asked and we discuss the comparisons and the distinctions between Libya and Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would simply say that the President has made clear where he stands on Syria, on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re making to isolate and pressure Assad, to bring about the political transition -- the culmination of the political transition that is already underway in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that while we are taking steps every day and every week in pursuit of this eventuality, that we are constantly evaluating what next steps need to be taken.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as others have said and the President has said and I have said, we don\xe2\x80\x99t rule options out.\xc2\xa0 But right now we believe that, for example, on the issue of providing lethal aid, that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the course of action that\xe2\x80\x99s the right one to take for this country.\xc2\xa0 We are providing non-lethal assistance and humanitarian assistance and coordinating other nations -- with other nations in providing support for the opposition as it forms itself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject -- the President still refers to the mess he inherited from time to time.\xc2\xa0 How does he feel about meeting President George W. Bush here tomorrow at the portrait unveiling?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be awkward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, not at all.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I know the President looks forward to it.\xc2\xa0 There is a --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about that mess?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there are differences without question between his approach and the approach and the policies of his predecessor.\xc2\xa0 That was certainly the case when I believe President George W. Bush had President Clinton to the White House for his portrait unveiling.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is well established that those two now-former Presidents have a good relationship, as did President Bill Clinton with President George H. W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 I think there is a community here with very few members that transcends political and policy differences.\xc2\xa0 I think you could even write a book about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even in the middle of a campaign season?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think a couple of my former colleagues have written a book about it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them a plug for The Presidents Club.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- I think the spirit represented by that book is what will be here in the White House tomorrow as I believe President George W. Bush as well as his father, President George H. W. Bush will be here for the unveiling.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama looks forward to that occasion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking politics?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think what has been the case and will be the case is that there is so much shared experience between, so far, the men and, one day, the men and women who hold this office that there is much to talk about that is -- that they hold in common.\xc2\xa0 So there is not a lot of need to talk about where they differ.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 While you won\xe2\x80\x99t give specifics about what options might be taken to continue to put pressure on Syria, can you give us any sort of broader indication as to what lies between expelling ambassadors, putting pressure on banks and, on the other end, military action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate or rule in or rule out what actions might be taken should the Annan plan fail, should Assad continue to refuse to abide by his commitments, should Assad continue to murder his own people.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are, as I said earlier, options that we do not pursue now, but that we do not rule out simply because it would be unwise to do so.\xc2\xa0 I think others in the administration and in the national security leadership have spoken to that.\xc2\xa0 And it is -- it would be unwise to speculate about where this would go because we are pursuing a policy now that -- with a host of other nations that is aimed at driving the Assad regime so deep into isolation and distress that it would bring about the peaceful political transition that is clearly the most desired ultimate result of this situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, do you have multiple options before you would look at military action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a number of things that we have done that go beyond some of the things that you mentioned, and there are obviously other actions that could be taken, both by us and by the international community or by individual nations, in concert with us or independently, that will address this problem.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to list them because decisions have to be made, and these are -- this is a step-by-step process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other issue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you were watching CNN yesterday with Donald Trump.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Always.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Donald Trump was going at the birther issue, and I wonder if there is any reaction to the fact that this continues to be an issue in this campaign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s up to, as I mentioned yesterday, those who seek the office to decide how they will run their campaigns and what views they associate themselves with.\xc2\xa0 As the President made clear in this briefing room when this became a ridiculous distraction last year, the American people are concerned about real issues that confront this nation, that concern principally with the fact that we are still not down the road to the final destination of full recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThose are the things -- jobs and the economy, the security of the nation, security of the American people -- that I think voters overwhelmingly care about.\xc2\xa0 I think one man\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to draw attention to himself by engaging in this kind of ridiculousness doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really change what most Americans care about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s still a ridiculous distraction?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think so.\xc2\xa0 Do you not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Mike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, Europe again in crisis.\xc2\xa0 Overnight, a Spanish bank in trouble.\xc2\xa0 Markets here -- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the markets -- but they\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re speaking like -- in a piece almost.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I beg your pardon?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Europe -- Europe again in crisis.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s the live shots.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I remember that from my, of course, marital affiliation -- that they remove all the verbs and just deliver it without -- yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where was I?\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In all seriousness, there is a sickness in Europe, an economic sickness that threatens a contagion here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President on down, top officials have said Europe needs to work this out among themselves.\xc2\xa0 My question is simply, why is that?\xc2\xa0 If it threatens the economy of this country, why can\'t the U.S. government be more forceful in either encouraging the Europeans on a certain path or helping them financially?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, we are being, I think, quite forthright in our consultations with our European friends in suggesting to them the directions that we think might be best; the decisions that we recognize are hard to take, especially in a system like the eurozone, but that would help resolve this crisis.\xc2\xa0 But it is obviously a sovereign issue for the individual nations of Europe and a broadly sovereign issue for the European Union, the eurozone, and it is for them to resolve that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is also the case that we are the greatest, most powerful nation on Earth, but we are not all powerful.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we must focus our efforts, first and foremost, on the things that we can directly control and completely control, which are the actions that we can take to help our economy grow here at home, to help our economy create jobs here at home, in part to insulate ourselves from the impacts of events that we cannot wholly control, whether they are economic crises in a part of the world -- parts of the world, or natural disasters in other parts of the world, or even here at home -- to bring it back to the beginning of this briefing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President continues to push Congress, as he did when he signed the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank today, to take action together in a bipartisan way to help the economy grow.\xc2\xa0 Despite all the understandable doubt about whether there is the capacity within Congress to do that, we continue to establish that there is that capacity.\xc2\xa0 And that was true today with the bill the President signed, it has been true with a number of other bills that the President signed that represent bipartisan efforts in Congress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he hopes that -- excuse me -- on the other items on the "To-Do" list -- on his "To-Do" list -- he hopes that on the other items of his "To-Do" list, as well as the surface transportation bill, as well as the need to take action to ensure that 7 million students in America don\xe2\x80\x99t see the rates on their loans double, that Congress will do the right thing and act in the interest of the American people and the American economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Bill\'s question --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Excuse me for my digression.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Bill\'s question on the visit tomorrow from 41 and 43, the Presidents Bush -- so this is all -- is there any private time built in to this?\xc2\xa0 This is all bonhomie?\xc2\xa0 There\'s not going to be any hashing out of the issues?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the specific schedule is.\xc2\xa0 I think the opportunities to speak with formers are not limited to occasions like this.\xc2\xa0 But I know that President Obama is looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0 I know he has always enjoyed his conversations with all former Presidents that he has had the opportunity to meet and talk with, and that will be the case tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl, and then Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker next week wants to put a tax bill on the floor that would repeal the medical devices tax in the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support or oppose that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, I confess I haven\'t looked into that.\xc2\xa0 I would venture that my suspicion is that there may be a difference of opinion, but I will have to get back to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think I said yes to somebody, but now I -- Mark.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you got any more to tell us about the tone of the phone call between President Obama and Mitt Romney today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, it was very collegial and friendly.\xc2\xa0 It was not, of course, particularly long; I think the campaign put out a statement about it.\xc2\xa0 The President discussed how he -- or mentioned how he looks forward to what he believes is a very important debate that will be engaged during this campaign.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- distractions notwithstanding -- in the end, that is what this election will be about.\xc2\xa0 It will be about each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s vision for America\'s future -- its economic future, principally, but also its national security future.\xc2\xa0 And you know where the President stands.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think one of the notable things about this cycle, to my mind, as a former journalist, is that, again, speaking of the past, I personally am surprised by a process that has led to a debate where the President has his vision and some agree with it and some don\xe2\x80\x99t, and the other side has a vision that is not unique or distinct or its own new vision -- it is the very same vision, the very same substantive policy proposals -- except exaggerated -- that led to a situation where we were in the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 And that will be the debate.\xc2\xa0 I expected a little more, honestly, but that is what we have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if I could take the privilege here, there\'s been some discussion stirred up by my citation of a MarketWatch article last week.\xc2\xa0 And no matter how you slice the numbers -- at least if you\'re being at all honest about it -- there is a simple fact, as Jared Bernstein wrote today, in assessing this once again -- if you apply the TARP bill to the President\xe2\x80\x99s spending in 2009, even if you make all those adjustments, it is simply a fact that President Obama has presided over slower average growth in federal spending than almost all of his predecessors -- depending on how you slice it -- equal to only, or as low as only President Clinton.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow what -- and I know the RNC likes to put this stuff out in contesting it, and they cited the size of the budget deficit 2009, \xe2\x80\x9910 and \xe2\x80\x9911, what they -- and the fact that they were among the largest in history.\xc2\xa0 Well, of course, they were.\xc2\xa0 Because what they never tell you is that President Obama was handed on January 20, 2009, the single-largest budget deficit in history.\xc2\xa0 And what they never tell you is that unlike what will happen when President Obama leaves office in four and a half years, the deficit that was handed to him in January of 2009 began as a surplus eight years earlier.\xc2\xa0 That is not something you ever hear the RNC talk about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so when it comes to responsible stewardship of our budget and our fiscal issues, I think we have a strong case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Where was the President when he made the call?\xc2\xa0 And during the campaign, will President Obama make sure that Governor Romney gets some kind of briefings or kept updated on some international crises sometimes?\xc2\xa0 I think that was done in that past for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that we will abide by convention and tradition, but I don\'t have anything specific for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there is a tradition, but does he think it important<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you mentioned that it was done in the past.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if they\'re going to be debating --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I think it is simply -- it is always the case that on national security matters in particular that there is something of a gap between what an incumbent President has access to and needs to have access to versus a candidate.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\'t know how that process works, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think he was here -- he was here in the White House, in the West Wing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he make the call from the Oval Office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe he did.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check.\xc2\xa0 I was in a meeting.\xc2\xa0 But yes, I think so, because he came out -- I think it was -- was it before or after the hurricane briefing?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll check.\xc2\xa0 But it was here in the West Wing and most likely in the Oval.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Donovan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up real quick.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that we got an answer to the question, is the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s impossible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President call the Polish Prime Minister, or does he have plans to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any calls to read out to you or preview for you.\xc2\xa0 I think we made clear -- I made clear or the statement makes clear that this was a simple misstatement and we regret it.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- if you look at the context here, it is absolutely obvious that the purpose here was to honor with this incredibly significant medal the remarkable bravery of Mr. Karski and those Polish citizens who fought against the terrible tyranny of the Nazis, and that it was Nazi death camps that the President was referring to.\xc2\xa0 So again, I don\'t have any other details for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I only ask simply because of the Polish Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- statement this morning.\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering if there was --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything new for you on it except what I just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any communication on a lower level with the Polish Prime Minister?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, not -- I just don\'t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously consult regularly with all of our allies, including Poland.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House is, I think this afternoon, preparing to take up a bill that would ban gender selection as a factor in abortions in this country.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it in a statement of administration policy, and I was wondering if the White House had a position on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will have to take that as well.\xc2\xa0 Been focused on other things.\xc2\xa0 But I will get back to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- Lesley, then Bill.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, last week the State Department issued a visa and Mariela Castro, Raul Castro\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, visited.\xc2\xa0 It created quite a stir.\xc2\xa0 There was one in 2002.\xc2\xa0 Were you taken aback by that?\xc2\xa0 And do you know if the President had any talks with any of the Democratic critics of that decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he did.\xc2\xa0 But I think -- I don\'t have any additional comments beyond what others have said on that matter.\xc2\xa0 I think the State Department took those questions because it\xe2\x80\x99s a visa issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And her endorsement of the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Next Tuesday is the recall election in Wisconsin -- Tom Barrett, the Democratic candidate, against Governor Scott Walker.\xc2\xa0 Has the President endorsed Tom Barrett?\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You might ask the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know that the -- or the DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said that she felt that a loss by Tom Barrett would not have any national impact if the Democrat lost there.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President shares that view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there are issues obviously unique to that state and issues unique to the spending that\'s happened in that particular matter that would suggest that she\xe2\x80\x99s right, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed it with the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, prior to the call this morning, when was the last time the President spoke directly with Mitt Romney?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe it was when he was a senator.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He never was a senator.\xc2\xa0 Oh, you mean the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know what you\'re focused on -- (laughter) -- singularly, but actually, the President was a senator.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, in the back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President say anything about Romney\xe2\x80\x99s phone call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just that they had a very good conversation.\xc2\xa0 He congratulated him on winning the nomination.\xc2\xa0 He, I think, mentioned that he knows what -- how difficult a process that is, having gone through it in 2008, also a fairly prolonged primary season, and said he looked forward to the debate in the fall.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 What exactly did Romney say on the call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t speak for former Governor Romney, so I can just tell you what the President said.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just adding to the -- what you were talking about with regards to the spending, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just been the RNC that\'s called that out.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post fact check has called that out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 There have been some disagreements between the PolitiFact and all the different fact checkers, and I think what I was pointing to was an assessment made by Jared Bernstein, an economist who used to work with me in the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s Office, that I think is -- look, he allowed where there were some issues that you could disagree on, on the numbers.\xc2\xa0 But even if you did that, the fact is, is that average growth in federal spending was greater under President George W. Bush, greater under President George H. W. Bush, greater under President Ronald Reagan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just a fact.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, it is hard to accept, I know, that the conventional wisdom about profligacy and irresponsible budget management turns out to be wrong, but it is.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I think it is clarifying to see these assessments made.\xc2\xa0 It is clarifying to remember an exercise that I have undertaken to look at the size of the federal government under different Presidents, look at the size of the increase in public workforce under different Presidents, and how they compare over the years.\xc2\xa0 I think all of these are very edifying instead of just retreating to the tired old, conventional -- pieces of conventional wisdom that actually don\'t bear out in the modern era.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 The President did quite well in the Texas primary but in previous primaries -- Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia -- is there anything you have to say?\xc2\xa0 Even in Texas, actually.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think those states will be challenging for the President in the general election.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in a Democratic primary, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have gotten --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can address those questions to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, all the way back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 The Romney campaign started its black outreach not too long ago -- folks in high unemployment in the area.\xc2\xa0 Many have argued that the Obama administration has not done quite enough for African Americans.\xc2\xa0 What is he doing to make sure that those people come back to the polls once again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, those are two different questions, and I\'ll refer you to the campaign for questions about voter turnout.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the President\'s record on the economy and economic recovery, and how the initiatives he put into place -- took a situation where we had catastrophic economic decline to a situation where we\'ve had steady economic growth; where we had a situation where we were experiencing catastrophic job loss at the rate of 800,000 jobs per month to a situation where we now have experienced 26 straight months of job growth -- is one that will be very much a focus of this campaign, and it is one that is, I think, affected communities that were hardest hit by job loss as well as other communities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that our efforts on surface transportation and other areas -- there are a number of measures -- going back to the Recovery Act and others -- that had, because of the nature of the assistance and the nature of where job loss was most keenly felt, had a disproportionate effect on certain communities, including the African American community.\xc2\xa0 But as for the political side of the question, I think the campaign ought to take that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the "To-Do" list, and whether --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the "To-Do" list.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House -- Eric Cantor released this sort of, last week on Friday, their schedule for the summer; nothing from the "To-Do" list is on their schedule.\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid has mentioned bringing up the small business tax cut, but none of the other items are headed for the Senate schedule at this point.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what you have to say as far as whether you\'re going to get any votes in the House, where you see this going in the next couple weeks.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, as I said in response to an earlier question, the President will continue to push Congress, both the Senate and the House, to take action on these kinds of measures that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, whether they make a specific agenda for the next few weeks or not, and act on them -- because they can pass, they can be signed into law, and they can help the economy grow and create jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a Republican leader in the House or a Democratic leader in the Senate, you are for cutting red tape so responsible homeowners can refinance; you\'re for investing in a new hire tax credit for small businesses; you\'re for creating jobs by investing in affordable clean energy, for the most part; and you\'re for putting returning veterans to work using skills developed in the military; and I assume you\'re for rewarding American jobs and eliminating tax incentives to ship jobs overseas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo these are things that I think have all the hallmarks of the potential for bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We expect that Congress will act on them.\xc2\xa0 We certainly will continue to press Congress to act on them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jim.\xc2\xa0 Take care, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:20 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
