EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve already heard from me a lot today, so in case there are some last-minute questions on policy, I\'ll take them.\xc2\xa0 But mostly, we wanted to just step back here quickly to see if you had questions about the trip and anything else that might have come up in the last couple minutes.\xc2\xa0 Jen has got something that she wants to start with.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So before we get started, just two things to highlight for you.\xc2\xa0 One, as you know, we\'re traveling to New York today.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to attend a dinner with 60 people at the NoMad Hotel in New York City.\xc2\xa0 Tickets for the event cost $40,000 per person.\xc2\xa0 One tidbit you don\'t know about yet is that Trevor Smith, who\'s the winner of the family photo with the President fundraising context the campaign launched, will meet with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Trevor is a West Hartford, Connecticut, native.\xc2\xa0 He lives in Astoria, New York, and is the manager of the Visitor\'s Center and Events at the National Jazz Museum in Harlem.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing I just wanted to highlight before we take your questions is you may have seen that Romney did an interview with ABC yesterday, where he was asked whether he had ever paid less than the 13.9 percent rate he paid in 2010.\xc2\xa0 He said, I don\'t remember, I\'m going to have to get back to you.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an exact quote, just to paraphrase.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re looking forward to him getting back.\xc2\xa0 As we understand, he said he\'s not going to go back now.\xc2\xa0 But I think I can speak for many, many millions of teachers, firefighters, nurses in this country who would love to know if he has paid a lower rate in past taxes than the 13.9 percent he paid in 2010 -- which as a reminder, is about half the rate of many middle-class families in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, we\'re happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- who\'s co-hosting the event tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a list of co-hosts.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let you know if there\'s more information that we\'re going to provide on that front.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts of Romney\'s comments in Israel?\xc2\xa0 Do they suggest that he is not ready for the world stage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, as soon as Mitt Romney started taking this trip -- he\'s now been to two countries and he\'s had two countries where he has made a series of fumbles.\xc2\xa0 He\'s been fumbling the foreign policy football from country to country.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a threshold question that he has to answer for the American people, and that\'s whether he is prepared to be commander-in-chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as I said, as we look to the past events, we know that this raises some questions about his preparedness.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll see how the rest of the trip goes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you mean to say -- do you think that "fumble" is the right analogy?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe you want to go to "scratch" or something?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think "foreign policy fumble" has a nice ring to it, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you advocating for American-style football to be included in the Olympics?\xc2\xa0 Is that the official position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I do love football, especially the Bengals and Andy Dalton.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a whole other, separate question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What state are the Bengals in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Ohio.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what did the Obama campaign do to try to turn around -- to get Solidarity to come in and take a position at odds with Lech Walesa, saying that he endorsed Mitt Romney?\xc2\xa0 Solidarity then came out and said that he did not speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious what the campaign did after hearing Lech Walesa this morning supporting Romney.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, this is actually the first I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how recently this happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The DNC has apparently heard about it.\xc2\xa0 The DNC sent out a bunch of rapid response emails.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what Jackie is asking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean, I think people are looking at the trip as, again, whether Mitt Romney is meeting the threshold of whether he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to be commander-in-chief.\xc2\xa0 We know the American voters are going to judge whether he\xe2\x80\x99s ready, whether he has met that threshold on this trip, through a series of his speeches, through remarks he\xe2\x80\x99s made, again, through fumbles he\xe2\x80\x99s made on the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you specifically on what the campaign did in response internally.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything new, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be watching the Olympics on Air Force One today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to force the Olympics onto all the TVs.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So hopefully -- I know there are a number of events going on today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you an update on whether he watches any.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he watched anything thus far that you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that was in the briefing today and we missed that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 I know that he was looking forward to the Olympics starting, so I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if 72 hours into it he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shocked and surprised, or just surprised?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just surprised.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any preview of the travel for the rest of the week, what themes to expect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far ahead of where we are.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he is going to be traveling to Ohio on Wednesday, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling to Virginia and Florida on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 You should expect to hear him continue to lay out the choice between his vision for the future, his plan to protect the economic security of the middle class, and how that contrasts with Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 And as we get closer, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything new to preview, we\'ll make sure you guys know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think about Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s fundraiser in Israel?\xc2\xa0 Is it appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that if you look at this trip -- and I was on the trip four years ago when President Obama, then-Senator Obama, took the trip when he went overseas -- and that trip was full of not only access to the media -- which I know you all enjoy -- not only did he do several press conferences and press avails, but we also had access for the media after meetings.\xc2\xa0 There were sprays.\xc2\xa0 They made remarks.\xc2\xa0 And we tried to keep it at the highest level possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we look at this trip, it seems clear it\xe2\x80\x99s a bunch of fundraisers and photo ops and fumbles.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure that Mitt Romney is moving the ball forward or that he\'s passing the threshold he needs to meet for the American people as to whether he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to be commander-in-chief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- transparency at the highest levels, why won\xe2\x80\x99t you guys release who the fundraisers are and the co-hosts for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s event?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, Hans, we do release information about the cost of tickets, information about where they\xe2\x80\x99re located.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have no idea who the President is raising money from tonight, not even co-hosts.\xc2\xa0 We just know that it\xe2\x80\x99s at the nondescript hotel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re an excellent reporter for Bloomberg, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will do some reporting when you\xe2\x80\x99re at the event.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re all familiar with the Federal Election Commission reporting requirements where you\'ll see exactly who contributed to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys are always taking a dig at Romney for not being transparent and having media access.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m merely asking --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- campaign dialogue about Obama really understands the working-class, and he\'s in touch with Americans who are anxious about the economy.\xc2\xa0 Here you are campaigning in New York; we have multi-thousand-dollar dinner plates for tonight.\xc2\xa0 How does that chime with what Obama is trying to sell as his personal story of understanding the working-class American, the biography that is out -- they\'re nervous about the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You\'ll hear him talk tonight about his commitment to fighting for the middle class, passing a tax cut for middle-class families to ensure they have that security, the contrast he has with Mitt Romney on those positions.\xc2\xa0 And I bet you a number of the people who are attending the event today are supporting him because of his strong support for the middle class and for families across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we all know fundraising is a natural part of any campaign.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been out there, he\'ll be out there in Ohio and Virginia and Florida later this week, talking to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ll hear him lay out the same choice tonight that you heard him last week and you heard him lay out the week before.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one thing for you, on the question of transparency, is that in terms of the bar of transparency, the President and the campaign and the White House have done more than any other White House and any other campaign to be transparent.\xc2\xa0 We release our bundlers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that Romney does not do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an area where we\'d love for him to come meet our bar.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when Josh started answering that question, is he answering it on the policy side of it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The policy of the Federal Election Commission, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The White House and the campaign are both transparent -- so to be clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:13 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
