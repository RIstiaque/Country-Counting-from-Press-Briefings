EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize we weren\xe2\x80\x99t on a long flight.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just start with this.\xc2\xa0 Just to let you know, on June 28th, the President will visit Alcoa Davenport Works factory in Bettendorf, Iowa, to tour the facility and discuss the critical role that the manufacturing sector plays in the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Manufacturing serves as the backbone of communities across the country, and the continued revitalization of the manufacturing sector is critical to our nation\'s success as we compete in a 21st century global economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\'ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Cantor pulled out of the debt talks.\xc2\xa0 Kyl is not going today.\xc2\xa0 Is there any way that this can be read as anything else but an impasse?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\'ve said from the beginning is -- and both sides have said this -- these talks were designed to find areas of common ground.\xc2\xa0 A lot of progress has been made.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Cantor made that point even as -- in his statement today.\xc2\xa0 And we also believe that\'s the case -- a lot of progress has been made. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously part of the design of this was to find areas of agreement and common ground, and identify areas of disagreement, which could then be referred to the leaders in Congress -- the leaders, obviously to the President -- who would then try to work out some of the areas of disagreement.\xc2\xa0 So these talks are in abeyance, but we expect going forward that we will continue to address these issues in search of a compromise. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would point out that the President supports a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 He does not support an approach that provides for a $200,000 tax cut for millionaires and billionaires paid for by a $6,000-a-year hike in expenses and costs for seniors.\xc2\xa0 And he believes the American people support him in that -- that we need to seriously cut spending, seriously reduce spending and our deficit, but we need to do it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And that means everything has got to be on the table:\xc2\xa0 spending cuts in non-defense discretionary spending, cuts in defense spending, and cuts in our tax expenditures.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he play a bigger role in the talks now, as they\'re asking?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is always been the case that these talks would proceed to a point where the remaining areas of disagreement would be addressed by leaders and the President and obviously the Vice President and others.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s no -- I don\'t have any announcement about what happens next, but this process has -- is sort of proceeding as envisioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This marks the next phase, then, where the President and Boehner --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s fair to say.\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to say the next phase like that there\'s a meeting scheduled with the President and Boehner.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President spoke with Congressman Cantor and Senator Kyl today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a lot of conversations going on.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that the American people expect us to find an agreement to substantially reduce our deficits, cut spending, while doing it in a balanced way so that we don\'t reverse the progress we\'ve made.\xc2\xa0 They also expect, as I said, a balanced approach that shares the burden and does not heap the burden for reducing spending -- reducing our deficits on only some segments of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, though, so are you saying that the Biden talks are no longer existing and now it\'s going to the President and Boehner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not making announcements about specific talks.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that these talks are essentially in abeyance for now.\xc2\xa0 They may or may not resume in different forms.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, as I said at a briefing earlier this week, it is not as though this negotiating group could simply declare into law what they agreed on.\xc2\xa0 So the process was always going to have to then proceed out of the negotiating room and move forward with the engagement of the Speaker, Senate leaders, House Minority Leader, the President, et cetera.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the Gay and Lesbian fundraiser tonight, is the President going to address the pending vote in the New York State Senate on gay marriage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he will mention it and I think make the point that, as he always has, that he believes that this is something that states should be able to decide.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the reasons, because of the -- that the President believes that we should withdraw from our participation in DOMA cases, because he believed it was unconstitutional.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to endorse the bill, the New York bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\'s not going to make any new declarations of a position.\xc2\xa0 He\'s simply going to address it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you discuss the timing of the SPR announcement?\xc2\xa0 It seems that oil prices were already coming down.\xc2\xa0 Why now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This has been -- we have been in discussions about this with oil-producing states for sometime now, as I\'ve been saying from the podium.\xc2\xa0 This is a move by the IEA, which is a 28-member organization, in a coordinated way to address a sustained, significant disruption in our oil supply caused by the events in Libya -- more than 140 million barrels of oil.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what it\'s aimed at.\xc2\xa0 That disruption is as real today as it was several weeks ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect any market or price impact from --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t anticipate or predict prices.\xc2\xa0 What we are addressing is an impact caused by a supply disruption.\xc2\xa0 And at this time it\'s necessary to do it because we\'re about to enter into the season when demand is at its highest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, can you address that nobody seems to be happy?\xc2\xa0 There Democrats who are complaining, Republicans who are complaining.\xc2\xa0 Some military officials are unhappy with the decision.\xc2\xa0 Is the President surprised by that?\xc2\xa0 What is his reaction to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re very pleased with the reaction because we think the reaction has generally been very positive, because the President made a decision that is fulfilling the commitment he made 18 months ago when he laid out his strategy.\xc2\xa0 This is about implementing a strategy and taking another step, as he committed to, that demonstrates the ongoing success in the strategy and the progress we\'ve made.\xc2\xa0 So, no, we\'ve been very satisfied with the response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He talked about nation building last night.\xc2\xa0 What can we expect?\xc2\xa0 How much money is being freed up, and can you give a timeline --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have dollar figures, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- again, this is about a long vision strategy that the President put into place in December of \xe2\x80\x9909, and at the heart of that strategy is defeat, disrupt, dismantle al Qaeda, contain the momentum, roll back the momentum of the Taliban, and give the Afghan government the space it needs to build up its security forces with our help, obviously with our training.\xc2\xa0 And all of that has preceded apace. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An essential element of this is the transition of security lead over to the Afghans, and obviously that is what allows us to gradually draw down our forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the domestic side of this, the domestic needs he\'s talked about, refocusing on the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 What is he talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think I can\xe2\x80\x99t improve on what the President said last night, that we need to get about the business and continue with the business of nation building at home, and that we have spent obviously more than a trillion dollars at war over the past decade and that\xe2\x80\x99s been a significant sacrifice that the American people have made. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are now in a position -- hold on, everybody -- a position of strength as we begin this transition, the drawdown.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you would want it to be, that you implement a strategy and you make progress in achieving your goals, and you proceed to the next step.\xc2\xa0 And this is the next step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new ICE memo that gives new guidelines for who officials can\'t deport.\xc2\xa0 Some are saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s similar provisions to the DREAM Act and that it\xe2\x80\x99s a backdoor way to get the DREAM Act in.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any on that.\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President reach out to Boehner or McConnell about the end of the debt talks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he did not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has not had a conversation that I know of -- and I was just talking to him -- today.\xc2\xa0 I will note, only because it\xe2\x80\x99s been confirmed and been made public, that the President did meet with Speaker Boehner last night as part of his -- just to discuss a variety of issues, following up on conversations they had on the golf course on Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He met with him or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before or after the speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did he already know that this was going to happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were -- we obviously have been aware, because we\xe2\x80\x99re participants in the conversations, in the negotiations, of where things stood.\xc2\xa0 And, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into anything about the content of the conversation between the Speaker and the President.\xc2\xa0 It was about a lot of issues and it was really following up on conversations they had on Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Cantor called the Vice President earlier today prior to his statement about the talks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:22 P.M.
