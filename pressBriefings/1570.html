CDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 When we land the President will be greeted on arrival by Governor Doyle, Congressman Kagan, and Mayors Schmitt and Barrettt of Green Bay and Milwaukee.\xc2\xa0 At the high school he\'ll be greeted by the school superintendent, Gregg Mass, and Principal Brian Davis and his wife, Dawn, and their four daughters.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll have a couple of small meetings, one before and one after, with grassroots activists and local political leaders.</div> <div class="legacy-para">A couple facts about Wisconsin and Green Bay:\xc2\xa0 In Green Bay unemployment is at 8.4 percent; Wisconsin as a whole, 8.6 percent; Green Bay has lost 5,400 jobs since December of \'07.\xc2\xa0 Wisconsin is a state, 137,500; and the rate of uninsured in Wisconsin is 8.5 percent.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I didn\'t hear that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\'s 8.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 I thought you had that in your story today.\xc2\xa0 I guess not.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The activists that he\'s meeting with afterwards, how long will that be and who are they?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\'ll be pretty fast.\xc2\xa0 It will be about 10 to 15 minutes and that\'s beforehand.\xc2\xa0 They\'re just local grassroots activists -- he does it at most of these stops, just a normal meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The meeting afterwards are leaders -- I don\'t have the full list with me, but it includes the Lieutenant Governor, Barbara Lawton and some others.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, activists on health care that he\'s meeting with before?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, just local grassroots activists, people who are involved in the community in different ways.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they involved in Organizing for America?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, some of them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he going to talk to them, given that that group is making a big push on health care now and he\'s here to talk about health care -- is that why he\'s meeting with them?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of it, for sure.\xc2\xa0 It\'s to check in with activists, to talk to them, listen to the questions and concerns that they have and encourage them for being involved in their communities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before we get into all the health care stuff, can we just get a couple -- like, just White House reacts on pandemic level, World Health Organization -- do you guys have anything on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has always treated this as a very serious issue.\xc2\xa0 And what the World Health Organization has done today is more an issue of geography than intensity.\xc2\xa0 And so our response will be as aggressive as it has been in making sure we\'re doing everything possible to mitigate its spread.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on consumer purchasing, an uptick for the first time in three months, more examples of green shoots in the economy?\xc2\xa0 The Commerce Department report came out this morning on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that, I\'d refer you to those guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looks like there\'s a compromise on the Hill to deal with the Guantanamo detainees, that they\'ll be able to come to the United States to face trial, but if they\'re convicted they won\'t be -- they won\'t stay here.\xc2\xa0 Where does the White House stand on this, and what\'s the role the White House has been playing in this deal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve obviously been talking to folks in the Democratic and Republican parties in both the House and the Senate to find the best possible solution to ensure the safety and security of Americans, and to make sure that justice is done here on the detainees who are going to be criminal -- who are going to be prosecuted in criminal courts.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m not going to get into the back and forth on what\'s happening in the negotiations other than to say that the President has obviously been talking to folks on both sides.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if justice is done here, where is that justice going to be carried out?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if they get justice in a U.S. courtroom, where should they be sent to serve out their sentences, if convicted?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to prejudge the conclusion of a result that hasn\'t come to pass just yet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both the American Medical Association today in comments they filed at a Senate Finance Committee said that it opposed the creation of a government health care --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Public plan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, public plan, and that\'s -- President Obama is going to be speaking to the American Medical Association on Monday in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be making a push?\xc2\xa0 Is this a big disappointment that the AMA has come out against this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get any further ahead of what Gibbs had to say yesterday about what the President will be discussing in Chicago on Monday in his address to the AMA.\xc2\xa0 But I will say, obviously, people come to the table with different ideas, what they support and oppose, and the President is working with folks in the different groups and people in both parties on Capitol Hill to ensure that we\'ve come up with the best comprehensive plan that\'s going to bring down costs, that will allow folks to keep their doctors and their health plans if they\'re happy with them, and assure that every American has access to quality health care.\xc2\xa0 As it comes to the public plan, obviously, he supports it, and that\'s what he\'s made very clear to folks on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a wide variety of things to discuss with the AMA on Monday, and with groups all across the spectrum.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he willing -- is he open to all of the various iterations of a public plan that are being discussed on Capitol Hill right now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President, as recently as yesterday, had Democrats and Republicans of the House to talk to them about their ideas, to hear their concerns and questions about comprehensive health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to do that from the White House.\xc2\xa0 There\'s staff on Capitol Hill every single day meeting with folks on -- from both sides of the aisle, and I don\'t want to get ahead of any negotiation or prejudge where this is all going to end up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think he can get the AMA on his side, or are they just a group that he\'s just going to have to kind of muscle past?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, he is going to continue to work with everybody, people who even oppose a lot of the things that we\'re for right now.\xc2\xa0 But what\'s important is that we come to the table with a lot more common ground than there has been in the past, giving some momentum to health care reform happening this year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so we\'re just going to continue to work with doctors, with health care plans, with Democrats, with Republicans, to everybody who has got an idea to make sure that we come up with the best possible plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to announce anything new here at this town hall?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not in the prepared remarks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is here with him today on the plane from his health care team or beyond?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Cecilia Munoz is here, Mona Sutphen.\xc2\xa0 I\'m here.\xc2\xa0 <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this your first gaggle?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Second or third.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Bill Burton, for the record, what\'s your middle name?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Allen.\xc2\xa0 William Allen.**</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, did you and Gibbs clarify reading Miranda rights to combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to direct you over to the Department of Justice on that.\xc2\xa0 They put out a statement on that yesterday, and I think that there\'s been some mischaracterization of what\'s happening over there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Green Bay is an area that has managed to keep its health care costs down.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about why the President decided to come here today?\xc2\xa0 I assume that\'s part of the reason.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President came here today -- the President decided to come because Green Bay is a community in the middle of the country that\'s feeling a lot of the pinch of the economic downturn that we\'re seeing all over the country.\xc2\xa0 And he wanted to talk to folks about his plan, hear from folks about -- or questions that they have about it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, that data that\'s come out about the efficiency in the Green Bay health care system is going to be talked about some today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he see something in Green Bay that can be replicated across the country?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s one of the things that the administration and folks across the spectrum are looking at right now:\xc2\xa0 What is it about communities like Green Bay and others across the country where people are getting a lot more bang for their buck in the health care system?\xc2\xa0 So to the extent that he\'s going to look at Green Bay as a model, he\'s going to look at all these communities to find what\'s really working out there and how we can replicate it across the country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of tone are we going to hear from the President today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s tone is going to be one of some urgency, that after decades of inaction, now is the time for health care reform.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to encourage folks to bring their ideas to the table, and he\'s going to talk about the importance of health care to our long-term economic growth and fiscal sustainability.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the AMA\'s announcement give him any pause or cause for concern that he won\'t be able to achieve his goal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He knew at the beginning of this process that people would oppose and support different elements that were on and off the table, and this is just one part of the process.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to talk to the AMA on Monday, and thinks that we\'ll be able to have an open and honest dialogue about the issues that we\'re all very concerned about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, at the beginning of the process, you guys stressed that he has these three principles, and beyond that he was completely flexible, so long as the outcome met his principles.\xc2\xa0 Now you\'ve gone a little deeper by saying he\'s for a public plan.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that -- are you going to use the same formulation?\xc2\xa0 In other words, any way that gets him a health care proposal with a public plan in it is fine?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he equally flexible on the details of a public plan as he used to be on the details of the whole health care overhaul?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think you would hear the President make a statement that foreclosed ideas in the way you just formulated that.\xc2\xa0 He\'s open to talking to folks about what their ideas are, and if people have a better idea on any different element of this than he has, he\'s open for business.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s a public plan, he\'s open to any way to actually get there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s actually what I did not say.\xc2\xa0 What I said --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wrote that letter to Congress last week saying he was for a public plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He did say that he\'s for a public plan.\xc2\xa0 He\'s made that crystal clear to folks in Congress and the different groups, and people are reacting in different ways to it.\xc2\xa0 But he thinks that that\'s the best way to ensure that costs remain down and we\'re able to keep the health insurance industry honest as it relates to cost and care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">You guys ought to sit down.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing on the shooting yesterday on Tyrone Johns.\xc2\xa0 Did the President speak to the family, at all, of the deceased security officer?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He has not just yet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it -- is it on the agenda for him to talk to anyone, or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I will keep you posted on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Say again?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I said I\'ll keep you posted.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  11:21 P.M.
