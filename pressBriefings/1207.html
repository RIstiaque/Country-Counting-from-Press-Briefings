EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Scott, is this your first appearance?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I want to apologize.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a late briefing and a delayed briefing, even after announced, but there are a couple of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been a busy day -- a lot going on in the Middle East and a lot going on at the White House, and I wanted to hold the briefing so that I could gather as much information as I could and be in a situation -- rather, a position to give you as much information as I could at this briefing, which I am now in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I have a few things I want to tell you about Libya before I take your questions.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has suspended embassy operations in Libya and will temporarily withdraw all embassy employees from Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 A ferry with approximately 200 U.S. citizens left this morning.\xc2\xa0 A charter plane recently took off for Istanbul, Turkey, with remaining embassy personnel and American citizens who had requested evacuation.\xc2\xa0 Further to what I started with, that obviously was very recent and one of the reasons why I wanted to delay the briefing was to make sure that plane had taken off.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s tasking to the government to prepare options to hold the Libyan government accountable for its violation of human rights, we have decided to move forward with unilateral sanctions, which we are in the process of finalizing; coordinated sanctions with our European allies; and multilateral efforts to hold the Libyan government accountable through the United Nations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President spoke today with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey to coordinate our efforts to respond to developments in Libya and to ensure appropriate accountability.\xc2\xa0 In his call with President Erdogan [sic], and his separate calls with President Sarkozy of France, President -- Prime Minister, rather, Cameron of the United Kingdom, and Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy yesterday, the President explained the unilateral measures that the United States is implementing, and noted his desire to coordinate on measures that our allies are considering.\xc2\xa0 He will continue these consultations to build international consensus for strong measures in the days to come.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier today the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued an advisory to U.S. financial institutions to take reasonable risk-based steps with respect to the potential increased movement of assets that may be related to the situation in Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During this period of uncertainty, FinCEN is reminding U.S. financial institutions of their requirement to apply enhanced scrutiny for private banking accounts held by or on behalf of senior foreign political figures, and to monitor transactions that could potentially represent misappropriated or diverted state assets, proceeds of bribery or other illegal payments, or other public corruption proceeds.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Additionally the United States has suspended the very limited military cooperation it had with Libya.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. military began to cautiously re-engage with Libya, as you know, in 2009 following Libya\xe2\x80\x99s decision to halt its weapons of mass destruction programs and compensate victims of terrorism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prior to the recent unrest and sales -- prior to the recent unrest, sales of spare military parts were pending.\xc2\xa0 They have been frozen.\xc2\xa0 Bilateral military events that were in the planning phases have also been frozen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United Nations Human Rights Council held an emergency session today in Geneva where it adopted by consensus a resolution that condemned the gross and systematic human rights abuses now being committed by the government of Libya; established an international commission of inquiry to investigate these abuses; and recommended accountable -- accountability measures for those responsible; and also recommended that the U.N. General Assembly suspend Libya\xe2\x80\x99s membership on the Council.\xc2\xa0 The United States strongly supports these efforts, and is already closely working with our international partners to carry out this suspension, which will be acted on by the General Assembly early next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition, as the President announced earlier this week, Secretary Clinton will travel to Geneva on Monday to speak at the Human Rights Council and to discuss with her international counterparts further measures on Libya, as well as events in the broader Middle East.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will meet with U.N. Security -- U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Washington and will discuss the diplomatic, legal and other actions needed to put a stop to violence against civilians in Libya.\xc2\xa0 He will also discuss the range of activities that U.N. agencies and the international community can undertake to address the significant humanitarian needs created by this crisis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States is involved in ongoing negotiations today at the UNSC -- the U.N. Security Council -- on a resolution that could include a weapons embargo, individual sanctions against key Libyan officials, and an asset freeze.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, the United States is utilizing the full extent of its intelligence capabilities to monitor the Qaddafi regime\xe2\x80\x99s actions, and we are particularly vigilant for evidence of further violence or atrocities committed against the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a lot there.\xc2\xa0 Let me go back to the -- what you said at the top about unilateral and multilateral sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Could you just describe them a bit more?\xc2\xa0 What are we talking about here when you -- when you mean sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, we\xe2\x80\x99re finalizing the sanctions that we will pursue.\xc2\xa0 Rather than enumerate them, I can tell you that they will be finalized soon and you will know specifically what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\xc2\xa0 I think the universe effect of sanctions is pretty well known, the kinds of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of that has been discussed.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to specify which ones now because we\xe2\x80\x99re still just finalizing those and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get them to you soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finalizing today or in the coming days?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In the near future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what gives the United States confidence that sanctions work against someone like Qaddafi and his regime?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are initiating a series of steps at the unilateral level and the multilateral level to pressure the regime in Libya to stop killing its own people.\xc2\xa0 This is a first step, and obviously we continue to review our options going forward, and the steps that we take in the near future are not the only steps we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to take if other steps are necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Qaddafi today -- or in the last few hours was calling on his followers to continue fighting protesters.\xc2\xa0 The militias that were loyal to him were still gunning down protesters.\xc2\xa0 So I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering as these things unfold, how is it that sanctions as you see it directly can affect that kind of inciting of his people to continue to kill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sanctions -- targeted sanctions that affect the senior political leadership of a regime like Libya have been shown to have an effect.\xc2\xa0 We are also, as I mentioned, pursuing actions that will ensure that the perpetrators of violations of human rights are held accountable.\xc2\xa0 And there is certainly a history of those kinds of perpetrators being held accountable in the international community.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we will take these substantial actions and leave other potential actions on the table and evaluate as we go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, at the top you mentioned the U.S. embassy in Tripoli has been withdrawn.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0 Have you evacuated?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It has been shuttered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The pair of sanctions to stop violence immediately is pretty weak.\xc2\xa0 What other steps, more forceful steps, could you take?\xc2\xa0 How quickly could they come?\xc2\xa0 Would more steps have to wait until Secretary Clinton goes to Geneva on Monday, for instance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that there has never been a time when this much has been done this quickly.\xc2\xa0 The United States has acted in concert with our international partners and with great deliberation and haste.\xc2\xa0 I know that in the past few days it\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes been frustrating when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to question American officials about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, and maybe haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten all the answers you want.\xc2\xa0 I discussed this with the President just a few hours ago, or an hour ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The purpose -- the focus that he has is on our obligation to the security of American citizens and also getting the policy right.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that has been the guide -- those have been the guiding principles as we\xe2\x80\x99ve proceeded over the course of the last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow, there\xe2\x80\x99s been reports that opponents of Qaddafi are taking control of some parts of Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 What is your sense of events there today?\xc2\xa0 And do you believe that Qaddafi is still in control of the capital?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of giving a play-by-play commentary on very dramatic events happening quite a long way away that we\xe2\x80\x99re all watching on television.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Colonel Qaddafi has lost the confidence of his people.\xc2\xa0 He is overseeing the brutal treatment of his people; the fatal violence against his own people; and his legitimacy has been reduced to zero in the eyes of his people.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more thing.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with French President Sarkozy that Qaddafi must leave?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have always said that that is a matter for the people of Libya to decide.\xc2\xa0 But I would repeat what I just said.\xc2\xa0 And because it is a matter for the people of Libya to decide, I think it is also clear that the people of Libya have expressed that his continued use of deadly violence, his clear violations of human rights, are totally unacceptable anywhere in the world.\xc2\xa0 And the status quo is simply neither tenable nor acceptable.\xc2\xa0 The Libyan people deserve a government now that protects the safety of its citizens, is responsive to their aspirations, and is broadly representative.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Colonel Qaddafi does not seem all that tethered to reality, right now in particular.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been accusing -- and experts on Qaddafi say he actually believes that the protesters in the street are -- have been fed hallucinogens.\xc2\xa0 How does the United States deal with a government -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t your typical dictator losing power.\xc2\xa0 This is a man who by many accounts seems to be legitimately unstable and perhaps willing to burn the house down with him.\xc2\xa0 How does that affect the policies that you go forward with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, we make our policy decisions based on some key principles, as you know, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve enunciated, the President has enunciated, and others.\xc2\xa0 And we evaluate the circumstances -- in this case, Libya.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about personalities.\xc2\xa0 It is about the expression of -- the peaceful expression of the dissatisfaction of the people of Libya with their leadership, and we support them in their aspirations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the actions we are taking I think in many ways answer your question.\xc2\xa0 We are acting unilaterally and multilaterally in a way that we believe needs to be done to put pressure on the regime to cease this horrendous activity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that the decisions about the Libyan future and the Libyan government should be made by the Libyan people, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the endgame here?\xc2\xa0 How do you see this ending in the best-case scenario?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The best-case scenario for any state in the region or the world is a government that is -- that treats its people well, that is responsive to the aspirations of its people, that includes its people in the political process in a democratic way, and that is a peaceful, responsible neighbor in its region of the world and in the international community.\xc2\xa0 I mean that\'s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but how about on -- how about in this actual situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to plan out or predict for you the day-by-day progression towards that goal, which is -- which I believe is the goal that the Libyan people hold, as do we.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously still a very, very fluid and dangerous situation in Libya, and a very fluid situation in the region.\xc2\xa0 But the goal is very clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that American intelligence was going to be working on this.\xc2\xa0 Could you elaborate at all on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t elaborate, but what I can say is that the United States is committed to utilizing the full extent of its capabilities to monitor the Qaddafi regime\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, to ensure that evidence is gathered of further violence or atrocities against -- committed against the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that the administration, the President in particular, has been hesitant to mention Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of concern about Americans still on the ground potentially being held hostage.\xc2\xa0 So now that it appears that most of the Americans who wanted to get out have gotten out, can we expect stronger language now from the President, perhaps calling him out by name?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put words in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mouth for the next time he speaks, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me use some pretty strong language against Colonel Qaddafi and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that from the President himself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I think I expressed when I came out here that there has been a clear reason for the way we have handled ourselves this week.\xc2\xa0 The airplane that carried American citizens, the remaining American citizens that we wanted to get evacuated from Libya, was wheels up less than an hour ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I would just say that your analysis of the situation is fairly accurate, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been all of a half an hour or so since those American citizens were in flight towards Istanbul.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So much has been asked already about this leader who really is unpredictable in terms of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do.\xc2\xa0 Is there really a sense of uncertainty -- you can do all that you have just talked about in sanctions, freezing assets and so forth, but again, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t Egypt, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t any other dictator that the U.S. has been dealing with.\xc2\xa0 Is it really just a crapshoot here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and others have said that each country is different.\xc2\xa0 Each situation that we have encountered in the region in the past number of weeks has been different.\xc2\xa0 And Libya is fairly distinct in a number of ways.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we can do, guided by the principles we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, is pursue a policy that protects American citizens, reflects our fundamental belief that the people of Libya deserve a government that treats them well, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill them indiscriminately, that is responsive to their needs and reflects their aspirations, and allows them to participate in a democratic process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can also take actions that -- some of which I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed from here and specifics -- some of the specifics of which you will hear later that we believe can put more pressure on the Libyan regime, can hold it accountable, can isolate it in order to get it to change its behavior.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do we expect to hear from the President on this at some point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements about the next time the President will address this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What exactly is he doing?\xc2\xa0 Is he making -- is he going to be making more calls?\xc2\xa0 What is his role in the coming days as this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s all implemented?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I read out to you the series of calls to foreign leaders specifically on this issue that he has made.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be more going forward.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously constantly being briefed by his national security team; Tom Donilon, the National Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0 There was a principals committee meeting that lasted two hours or so in the Situation Room earlier today that ended not that long ago -- again, one of the reasons why I wanted to wait for that to end before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 So his participation is robust.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sanctions take a while not only to feel the effect but also to take effect.\xc2\xa0 What is the timeline here for these sanctions to actually go into effect and then for them actually to be felt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The mechanics of the sanctions, which actually haven\xe2\x80\x99t been finalized, I\'ll leave to others to describe once the -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve been finalized.\xc2\xa0 But understand that as we reviewed the options available to us, we had a great interest in pursuing those that could be implemented quickly.\xc2\xa0 And again, without putting specific timelines on implementation, some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering doing are the things that we can move most quickly on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say quickly, and I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t put a specific timeline, but are we talking days or are we talking weeks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- there are a range of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to do; the specifics you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing about in the near future.\xc2\xa0 And the different -- there are timelines about -- in terms of how things are implemented that I can\xe2\x80\x99t characterize.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I know I\xe2\x80\x99m beating a dead horse here, but when you say \xe2\x80\x9cnear future\xe2\x80\x9d do you mean next week sometime?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sooner than that, Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, perhaps?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get more specific.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one last question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- wear him down.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about before Friday at 8:30 p.m.?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you were -- when there were discussions going on back there about being careful to say things while there were still Americans who wanted to get out on the ground, were there discussions of fears of what happened 30 years ago -- I think it was 30 years ago -- in Iran?\xc2\xa0 Were there specific discussions about the Iranian hostage crisis in saying that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we want to avoid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of at all, Chip.\xc2\xa0 There weren\xe2\x80\x99t historical references that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I want to be clear about this, that the President, in order to focus on his priorities of getting the policy right, protecting American citizens -- the obligation that we all have here and that he has ahead of all of us -- we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly willing to take a few days of consternation in the press in order to get it right.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that -- I mean, this is still a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the situation in Libya remains dangerous and unresolved, as it does in -- I mean, the situation in the whole region remains unresolved in different ways.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut all I would say is I would encourage everyone to remember as these events unfold and we deal with them, that the goals we have are peaceful reactions to peaceful demonstrations; respect for the universal rights of the peoples of these countries where there are demonstrations, and their aspirations; and reform -- responsiveness from the governments that will lead to greater stability and greater prosperity, we believe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is, in the end, very good for the people in the region, for the peoples of these countries, and very good for the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President is focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Wendell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. have any contact with members of the Libyan opposition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the discussions that we may be having with different folks in Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, P.J. Crowley at State said that we had tried for a couple of days to get the ferry into port before the weather had stuck it there for a while, and it was unclear whether we\xe2\x80\x99d been unable to get it in because of chaos or whether the Libyan government actually opposed -- frustrated our attempts to get it in.\xc2\xa0 Have we determined yet what the hold-up was?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, on the operation that was designed to evacuate American citizens and embassy personnel, I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I can say that the very important thing is that that ferry did depart, and as did the airplane that left a little later, not long ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I asked is because other countries were able to get -- to evacuate citizens earlier, and I wondered whether the Libyans actually frustrated our attempts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that operation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter, will the President, in light of his 2007 comments, walk a picket line in Wisconsin?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I said, Wendell, yesterday I think holds true today, which is the President has a variety of ways to communicate his views on various matters, including the rights of America\xe2\x80\x99s working men and women.\xc2\xa0 And I would just say that whatever shoes he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing, he is always standing with America\xe2\x80\x99s working men and women and America\xe2\x80\x99s middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On union rights, do public sector unions and private sector unions have different rights and responsibilities?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking exactly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if -- because private sector unions ultimately are competing with, if you will -- not competing but negotiating with board members, and because public sector unions are ultimately negotiating with taxpayers, do they have different responsibilities and rights?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we have said and what the President has said is that with regard to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the states now, as the states address their fiscal situations, everybody needs to tighten their belts, everybody needs to sacrifice and work together to bring state budgets into balance, to bring stability to the fiscal situations in the states, much as we need to work together at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s our position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, first, anything that Congress has to pass on these sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys figured that out yet?\xc2\xa0 Do you need congressional --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All this can be done with executive orders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s true, but if it\xe2\x80\x99s not we will get back to you. [**FOLLOW-UP: The sanctions that President Obama will impose against Libya do not require Congressional approval.]<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you done any consulting with Capitol Hill yet or not yet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to take that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, given that the issue of American citizens being in Libya sort of tied the hands of what you could say today versus what you said yesterday and all of these things, have you learned some lessons from this?\xc2\xa0 Are you dealing differently in places like Bahrain, in Yemen, in Jordan?\xc2\xa0 Are any warnings to be given -- here\xe2\x80\x99s Libya, in the middle of Egypt and Tunisia, and we waited until I believe February 20th is the first time even a suggestion was made for American citizens to start thinking about getting out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, what I would say, again, is that every country is different, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before.\xc2\xa0 And the situations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the countries where there has been unrest have been different.\xc2\xa0 And we are always evaluating the actions we take and, if you will, doing after-action analyses of the actions we take.\xc2\xa0 But this is obviously ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that one of the lessons we have taken from this is that we need to focus on our core priorities, not on the understandable desire at different points along the way to express how we feel in a way that could sometimes be counterproductive to our long-term goals of the policies that we need to pursue, or to the safety of American citizens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a review going on right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 This is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s a great to deal --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but given what happened in Libya --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the situation where basically you guys couldn\xe2\x80\x99t announce these things today until you knew that airplane was wheels up.\xc2\xa0 Is that why this --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Chuck --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that\'s why you waited --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me point -- well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- there are a variety of reasons why things have unfolded the way they have.\xc2\xa0 I would also remind you of what I said before, that this has been a very rapid effort to work with our international partners, to analyze and select the options that we want to take.\xc2\xa0 And I know we live in a world where a great deal is happening all at once and where much of it is being witnessed live on television, and that that creates an understandable demand for urgency.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I can say, again, if you look at the history of how these things are handled, there has been great haste in moving to the point where we are today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going to this intelligence, the intelligence assets that you were saying, and I know -- this is beyond CIA, so it\xe2\x80\x99s every part of the American intelligence community, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Defense, parts of the Air Force intelligence, Army intelligence, Defense Department -- I mean, not just --\xc2\xa0 I mean, can you at least elaborate on what parts of the intelligence community?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The full extent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The full extent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The full extent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it just observational?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s all I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say about it.\xc2\xa0 The point is, is that we intend to participate with our international partners in an effort to hold accountable those who have committed atrocities and human rights abuses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Helene, how are you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xc2\xa0 How are you, Jay?\xc2\xa0 Since sanctions by their very nature take so long to go into effect, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re multilateral or bilateral, what sort of steps are you taking that are immediate right now beyond shuttering the embassy that could influence Colonel Qaddafi?\xc2\xa0 Are there messages that we\xe2\x80\x99re relaying to him?\xc2\xa0 Are there --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think without getting ahead of the specific -- the announcement of the specific sanctions, the things that we are pursuing, timelines are different depending on the action that\'s being taken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of communicating to the regime, I think that the expression of what we are doing, both as one country and collectively with our international partners, is very clear and loud.\xc2\xa0 We are talking about the isolation of this regime and the -- and isolating of this regime and the taking of measures that put, we hope, the kind of pressure on it that needs to be put on it in order to get it to stop behaving the way it\xe2\x80\x99s been behaving, which has de-legitimized it in the eyes of the Libyan people and the world. So I think -- that message is, I think, being delivered and heard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow, so is the intention of the sanctions to punish this government for what it\xe2\x80\x99s already done, or to help push it from power?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The intent of the sanctions -- actually, the answer is neither.\xc2\xa0 The intent of the sanctions is to make it clear that the regime has to stop its abuses.\xc2\xa0 It has to stop the bloodshed.\xc2\xa0 The determination about who should govern Libya has to be made and will be made by the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 As I have made clear from here, it is clear to us and we believe to the Libyan people and to the world at large, that the Qaddafi regime and Colonel Qaddafi himself has lost the confidence of his people, and it is for them to decide who should leave.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just quickly.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like they have decided, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in your eyes said that -- legitimacy of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s government is zero, in their eyes.\xc2\xa0 Given that they\xe2\x80\x99re facing a well-armed government with little conscience, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there more that the United States can do to support those aspirations?\xc2\xa0 They want the government to change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Scott, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the options -- the actions we will be taking, we have taken already, and we will take in the near future are not the endpoint for us.\xc2\xa0 We will be constantly reviewing the options that we have, that are available to us, and certainly leave open the possibility of taking further action as necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I was wondering, just to clarify, do we know that all Americans are now out with that last chartered flight?\xc2\xa0 Are there any of them left that you know of?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to state with any sort of certitude something I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific answer for.\xc2\xa0 I know that we spent a great deal of time ensuring that American personnel and Americans who wanted to be evacuated were evacuated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned the Situation Room meeting a few hours ago with principals and such.\xc2\xa0 Is there any contemplation of a military, U.S. military role, at some point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would just refer you to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, which is we are not -- the action we are taking, which I elaborated on in my reading time at the beginning of this briefing, are pretty detailed and those are the things we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing in the near term, but we are not removing options off the table at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Nicholas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Has there been an evolution in this administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy posture over the last few years from one of valuing stability in the Middle East, maybe moving in a more pro-democratic direction, favoring aspirations -- meeting aspirations and human rights?\xc2\xa0 When we look at what the President said at the U.N. General Assembly last fall and what Secretary of State Clinton said at Doha talking about regimes falling into the sand, slipping into the sand -- has there been sort of a pro-democratic tilt or shift in the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy since he took office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, I would point you to the speech the President made in Cairo, which spoke very clearly about his view on the universal rights of the people of the world, including the peoples in that region, and the need for the countries in that region to listen to the aspirations of their people and to act accordingly in terms of bringing reforms about, precisely because stability is important -- not precisely because, but because the aspirations of the people need to be heard and listened to and respected.\xc2\xa0 But these are not conflicting goals, in his view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been great consistency, in his view.\xc2\xa0 One thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear, that he has made clear, is that these movements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen have been true grassroots movements where the voices of the people of these countries have been heard.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important that that be seen to be the case for their success, because it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the people of the countries own the process.\xc2\xa0 And that is one of the goals we have as we negotiate, navigate our way through these very historic times that we\xe2\x80\x99re in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get somebody I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Me?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Me?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not you, sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just going to follow up on Scott\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 You talk about isolation.\xc2\xa0 Why would the regime, who\xe2\x80\x99s fighting a battle of survival, would care about any measures that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take weeks or even days, because many people don\'t expect the Qaddafi regime to survive even by next week.\xc2\xa0 So for him, any behavior is not going to -- any measure is not going to moderate his behavior because it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of life or death for him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for what -- how the -- or predict how the regime will behave.\xc2\xa0 I know that we are taking the kinds of actions that we can both unilaterally and with our international partners to influence his behavior -- the regime\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, to isolate the regime, and to hold it accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 We noticed there was a call to the Bahraini Crown Prince, and there was a statement, as well, applauding the Algerians who are lifting the emergency law.\xc2\xa0 What is the President trying to say to these leaders?\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to salvage their chances of staying in power, or tell them to get their act together because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be next?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s message in these conversations and the message that has been carried by other American officials in conversations, similar ones, has been the same, and it goes back to the principles we\xe2\x80\x99ve enunciated, which is, reform is necessary.\xc2\xa0 Responsiveness to the aspirations of the people is necessary.\xc2\xa0 And so when steps are taken that are in that direction, we have acknowledged that as positive.\xc2\xa0 But it is not in any case about picking leaders or deciding who should be in power.\xc2\xa0 That is up to the people of the region and the countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more on Libya.\xc2\xa0 You said you were gathering information and evidence about crimes against humanity in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Would the United States support the British proposal asking the International Criminal Court of issuing an indictment against Libyan officials for crimes against humanity?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what -- let me find it here, that I mentioned at the top.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are interested in holding accountable the -- those who perpetrated human rights violations and atrocities in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a little -- I want to make sure I have the right name for this process -- in any case -- getting lost in paper here.\xc2\xa0 But the answer is, without getting into specifics about the procedures, the steps we are taking, the steps we support are clearly designed to work with the international community to make sure there is accountability.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- yes, you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mike, right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear that you don\'t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for the U.S. government to dictate the outcome and to actually call for Muammar Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s removal from office.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s say somehow he is able to hold on and the protests fade.\xc2\xa0 Is he somebody the government could think about doing business with in the future?\xc2\xa0 Would you be willing to normalize relationships?\xc2\xa0 Would you be willing to staff that embassy again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I want to make sure you heard what I said.\xc2\xa0 It is very clear that Colonel Qaddafi has lost the confidence of the Libyan people, and we have always said that it is up to the Libyan people to decide who their leader should be.\xc2\xa0 His continued use of deadly violence against his own people in clear violations of human rights are totally unacceptable anywhere in the world.\xc2\xa0 The status quo is neither tenable nor acceptable, and the Libyan people deserve a government now that protects their safety, is responsive to their aspirations, and is broadly representative.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about personalities for us.\xc2\xa0 It is about principles.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, it is about respecting the desires and aspirations of the people of Libya and of the other countries that have been affected by this unrest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- with the glasses, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s determination earlier in the week that sex orientation classifications lead to heightened scrutiny led him to determine that section three of DOMA was unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 In that letter that the attorney general sent to Speaker Boehner, he said that pursuant to the President\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, this would be applied in other cases, which yesterday was applied to two cases in the Second Circuit.\xc2\xa0 My question is, did the President give any instructions to the Justice Department regarding his view of the constitutionality of the status of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d the appeal of which, in Log Cabin versus -- Log Cabin Republicans is due today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, the appeal is due today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- we have to wait for that final brief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did the President give any instructions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we are very supportive of and glad that Congress repealed \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d and we are monitoring and glad that the process is proceeding smoothly and efficiently, the process of repeal.\xc2\xa0 But on the brief and the President\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what you had said regarding the DOMA briefs was that the President -- that the deadline had forced the administration\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\xc2\xa0 Did the -- has the administration in any way reacted to today\xe2\x80\x99s deadline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the Department of Justice is going to file a final brief.\xc2\xa0 And we will see what that says.\xc2\xa0 But we expect the brief to say the following:\xc2\xa0 reiterate -- number one, reiterating that the courts should not decide the case or the constitutional question, due to the pending repeal, which should be effective in a matter of months.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the repeal is proceeding smoothly and efficiently.\xc2\xa0 Our goal was to have it repealed.\xc2\xa0 It has been repealed.\xc2\xa0 And that process of the repeal is now proceeding efficiently and smoothly, which is a good thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has not said that he believes that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d is unconstitutional?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Victoria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Victoria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there are now violent spreading demonstrations in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 How is the U.S. government coordinating with the Iraqi government to respond to those demonstrations?\xc2\xa0 And what is the level of concern that if these demonstrations are ongoing, that could affect U.S. troop levels?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with regard to Iraq is the same that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with regard to the region, which is that the governments in the region need to be responsive to the -- and listen to the voices of their people and to respond to demonstrations in a peaceful manner.\xc2\xa0 We remain very much on track as regards our policy of drawing down our forces.\xc2\xa0 And certainly I see no reason with regard to your question for that policy to be in any way affected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll all be involved in any way in the response to the demonstrations in Iraq.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In what way?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we are -- we obviously have an embassy there that works with and consults with the government and we have military presence there that now serves in an assist posture, advise-and-assist posture, but nothing exceptional that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of two questions, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the same question, really.\xc2\xa0 Prior to the decision of this administration to propose sanctions, did the administration reach out to other governments in the region like Saudi Arabia or Jordan before that?\xc2\xa0 And what reactions did they give you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on conversations like that.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out the President\xe2\x80\x99s calls.\xc2\xa0 But -- yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on my own question.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 The President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Was that somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with allies -- obviously, the Prime Minister and -- Berlusconi, et cetera, Sarkozy.\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussions of a unified multilateral approach to these emerging governments that are coming out almost week by week in terms of an overall --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Emerging governments --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Libya and Egypt and Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 These -- there\xe2\x80\x99s changes in terms of how they would approach these new entities, basically.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of in that regard.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the discussion has been focused on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just Libya right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Principally, yes.\xc2\xa0 The phone calls that I have mentioned at the top have been focused on Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The British sent a warship, the HMS Cumberland, to help with the evacuation of British citizens from Libya.\xc2\xa0 The United States has a Marine amphibious ship, the Kearsarge, in the Red Sea.\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought right now of moving U.S. naval assets to the coast of Libya?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not show the flag in that way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Defense Department for how we deploy our forces.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you talked about -- when you talked the British ship, I believe you said to evacuate its people -- well, we have evacuated Americans.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the question is getting at.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the question is why has the United States not used military assets to show the flag and to show its possible support for the rebellion in Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jonathan, I would just point you to the steps we are taking and to the fact that we are not taking any options off the table in the future.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And wait -- one more.\xc2\xa0 The NAC -- did the United States call the NAC meeting, the North American Counsel meeting, today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the CR?\xc2\xa0 There -- the CR is being written --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are glad that the leaders of Congress are working on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We have said that the process is on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 The House has passed something.\xc2\xa0 The Senate needs to pass something.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that -- all of us agree that a government shutdown would be bad for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It would create a great deal of uncertainty and potential instability and might have a negative impact on the economy, as well as specific impacts that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that a compromise can be reached.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on a position -- what position we may or may not hold down the road.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the idea of a two to four week --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
