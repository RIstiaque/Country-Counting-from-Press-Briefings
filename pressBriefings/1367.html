b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Sorry for my lateness.\xc2\xa0 Let me do two quick announcements, readouts, before I take your questions.</p>\n<p>The President dropped by a meeting between General Jones and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak this morning.\xc2\xa0 The President reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and our determination to achieve comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a two-state solution with a secure Jewish state of Israel living side by side in peace and security with a viable and independent Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>He and President [sic] Barak discussed challenges to regional security, how to deal with threats that both the U.S. and Israel face, and how to move forward toward a comprehensive peace.</p>\n<p>Also this morning, the President called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to extend his best wishes for a healthy recovery from early March surgery and to congratulate him on the birth of his first granddaughter.\xc2\xa0 They discussed the importance of creating an atmosphere for peace in the Middle East and agreed to follow up in the near future on a broad range of issues of mutual interests.</p>\n<p>And with that, Mr. Babington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A two-part question on immigration.\xc2\xa0 The new Arizona law, when it takes effect, will obviously require some federal partnership -- some of these people who are detained can be turned over to the Feds immediately, I believe, and certainly any deportation would have to be done by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 What level of cooperation does the administration plan to give in this new law?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I would refer you to the comments that the President made on Friday, where he has asked the Department of Justice to examine and evaluate the impacts -- potential impacts of this law, those impacts on a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights.\xc2\xa0 We\'re in the process of evaluating what the law means.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is a possibility, given what you get back from Justice, that there might not be full cooperation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s read of what\xe2\x80\x99s in the law.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect that to come in the next day or so.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re obviously looking through this to examine, as the President mentioned, the impacts on civil rights and other implications.\xc2\xa0 So I will -- we will wait for that readout from the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could, on a related question, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that you want to do an energy bill and immigration bill this year.\xc2\xa0 Given the time frame in Congress, is that feasible?\xc2\xa0 And which of those two is the priority?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, I think that we have seen progress made on both issues.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to continue to make progress on both those issues.\xc2\xa0 I know we had -- there were some statements this weekend by Senator Graham and others that have been working on this legislation.\xc2\xa0 The Chief of Staff talked with Senator Graham on Friday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think when I look at both of those issues and look at the United States Senate, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a crowded calendar, but I would say that our dependence on foreign oil, the national security problem it creates, the environmental problem that it creates, the economic problem that it creates, demonstrates that it has to be a priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would say if you look at what has happened in Arizona and the implications that that type of law would naturally -- could naturally drive each state to creating its own immigration laws\xc2\xa0 -- that\'s because the United States at the federal level has failed to act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think there is room for progress on both issues.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to work with members of both parties to see that happen.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, just to follow up on that quickly, which is the higher legislative priority for the President to push at this moment:\xc2\xa0 climate change or immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Matt, I don\'t -- I think when whichever bill has the support it needs to be passed, that\'s what will move first.\xc2\xa0 But I would say to you I think we can make progress on more than just one issue.\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham, Senator Kerry and Senator Lieberman all spent time here at the White House just last Tuesday with the Chief of Staff on trying to work through many of those issues.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t -- you all see this as an either/or, but this administration does not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President said very clearly passing health care reform was his top legislative priority, and that\'s been done.\xc2\xa0 Now what\xe2\x80\x99s next?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the next one.\xc2\xa0 And once that\'s done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Then once that\'s done, we can move on to the next one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so no Republicans are showing any signs of voting to move ahead with a formal debate on financial regulatory reform, so that vote looks likely to fail tonight.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s next step, and what are the red lines that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the next step, quite honestly, is going to be a vote a couple of days after that.\xc2\xa0 Matt, there are -- as you rightly point out, there will be a vote tonight.\xc2\xa0 It appears as if all the Republicans have decided that the rules in place now are the rules we should have going forward.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what happens if we don\'t do anything.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about the consequences of not moving this proposal forward.\xc2\xa0 The same rules of the road that got us into this mess -- the same rules of the road that let banks and financial institutions make their own decisions -- they\xe2\x80\x99re still the rules of the road.</p>\n<p>Washington is a very poll-driven city.\xc2\xa0 I note today that there\xe2\x80\x99s a poll out that shows two-thirds of the American public for stronger regulation over Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a tenable political position for the Republicans to be in to continue to say the rules of the road we have for Wall Street should be as they were when the economy collapsed and nearly ruined everybody.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the Secretary of Treasury, Dr. Summers, and others have met over and over and over again with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I think in the end we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a bipartisan vote because I think the position they\xe2\x80\x99re in right now is just simply untenable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a better question for them.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the White House released video of the President urging supporters to prepare for the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 Was this in part because there\xe2\x80\x99s deep concern of losing a lot of seats and losing control of Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to debate what the outcome of, or why those elections went whatever way they went.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re many months away.\xc2\xa0 Obviously more campaigns are gearing up and the President wanted to speak directly to his supporters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was there any concern at all, though?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, they\xe2\x80\x99re elections that are going to be held in November and I can assure you the President will participate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the SCOTUS nomination, any progress?\xc2\xa0 Is the President making any progress on that front?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any time this week perhaps?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect any announcements this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions on the General Jones joke.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the apology now.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a problem with what he had said and did the White House urge him to apologize?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Yunji, I think the apology rightly speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Why was the -- why were his remarks omitted from the official transcript?\xc2\xa0 Usually you guys include everything.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this was obviously not a presidential event.\xc2\xa0 There was no attempt -- it was obviously an on-camera speech.\xc2\xa0 There was no attempt to deceive.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a stenographer at most non-presidential events.\xc2\xa0 So I think the remarks that were put out were put out as the text of the speech was to be delivered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there was no purposeful reason --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the financial regulation, the $50 billion resolution fund is still one of the sticking points there and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something the President, as you have made clear, really supports. So has he gotten involved in this to try to reach -- you said the Republicans want the rules of the road that are now in place.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not really true.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They want a -- no, they don\'t.\xc2\xa0 They want a compromise.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you don\'t have a new -- if you don\'t have a new bill -- the only way you compromise is to get on the bill.\xc2\xa0 The only way we can make progress is to get on the bill.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote to -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote not to get on the bill which is going to change the rules of the road, then you\xe2\x80\x99re for the rules of the road that we have right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Democrats are going to make some compromises eventually anyway.\xc2\xa0 Why not do it now to get the -- so that the Republicans will vote with them?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a political game going on, on both sides.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Chip, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a political game.\xc2\xa0 We have met -- administration officials have met over and over again with Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been talking to them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chairman Dodd -- as we read out last week, the President talked to a number of Republicans, including Scott Brown on financial reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to say that the Republicans want the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that Senator Dodd has met over and over and over again with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I now see there\xe2\x80\x99s discussion on the Republican side of putting out their own bill.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that anybody believes that that\'s going to be a stronger reform product; that what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have in there, what is going to be contained on a whole host of issues, is seen as something that\'s regulating Wall Street more strongly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President consider talking to them and trying to get them to drop the $50 billion fund and to get the Republicans on board?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s administration has, Chip, spent a huge amount of time talking with Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to them now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, through the Secretary of Treasury, as his chief person on financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten to the point where he personally is talking to them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we made a couple of calls last week.\xc2\xa0 Chip, I will say this:\xc2\xa0 I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that\'s playing a game here, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Republican Party that, again, seems to think that the best way forward is to keep what we have in place now, which led us to the brink of economic collapse just a few years ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does the President not support the $50 billion fund?\xc2\xa0 What is his policy problem with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is not in our original proposal.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of different ways to deal with the possibility of needing resolution authority.\xc2\xa0 Resolution authority is contained in the bill.\xc2\xa0 But again, Chip, the best way to get -- the best way to move this forward, the best way to make progress is to get the legislation, is to get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They could get on legislation if the Democrats would give on a couple of these issues.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\'s true.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\'s borne out by anything that they\xe2\x80\x99ve said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen Mr. Blankfein\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail or had it read that the -- where he said that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe made more than we lost by betting against the housing market,\xe2\x80\x9d and did he have any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, honestly, if he -- the degree to which he saw some of that that\'s been reported over the weekend. I will check in on that.\xc2\xa0 But, Chip, I hate to marry your second question with your first question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it anyway. The rules of the road that allowed people to do what you just asked me and is alleged to have happened is as a result of the fact that the rules of the road put Wall Street in charge of Main Street.\xc2\xa0 If you want to change that, then you have to support real reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the choice in front of everybody at 5:00 p.m. tonight in the U.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s a mischaracterization to say the Republicans want the rules of the road that are in place now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Based on what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on everything they\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 They clearly want --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Like what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They just don\xe2\x80\x99t want exactly what the Democrats are pushing now.\xc2\xa0 They want a compromise.\xc2\xa0 Nobody up there is saying, we don\'t want any change.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, then, vote to get on the bill, and then we\xe2\x80\x99d be on the floor and we could find out about amendments.\xc2\xa0 But simply saying no over and over and over again, keeping the rules of the road in place, leads you to where we were when we got into this mess.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a few follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 So is it officially -- were you officially saying no SCOTUS announcement this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so that\'s -- no SCOTUS announcement this week.\xc2\xa0 Second, on the financial bill, if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a done bill -- they\xe2\x80\x99re still negotiating between, for instance, Senator Dodd and Senator Lincoln about derivatives -- then why not wait -- why not wait a day or two?\xc2\xa0 I mean, when they\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to figure out what the -- because they\xe2\x80\x99re still negotiating about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the main bill, then this idea of the derivatives being --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- Chuck, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a tremendous amount of progress on that.\xc2\xa0 My sense is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect an announcement before 5:00 p.m. today on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a better question for Senator Dodd and Senator Lincoln.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned another vote.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect, if this goes down, it to be right -- brought right back to the floor --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going away.\xc2\xa0 This issue isn\xe2\x80\x99t going away --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- because we can\xe2\x80\x99t let this issue go away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the timing that you understand it to be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would assume that we would come back somewhat quickly to this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- I have not been told that as a matter of course from the Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s office, but, Chuck, we have a window of time to change the rules of the road; to have real, genuine Wall Street reform passed into law so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves at the two-year anniversary of a dramatic economic collapse created by risky decisions repeated; and that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken the common-sense steps to change how we govern Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said twice -- on the immigration/energy issue, you said twice, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why progress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be made.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between progress and a finished piece of legislation this year.\xc2\xa0 Your assumption is -- is it fair to say that you believe only one can get done this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to how many can.\xc2\xa0 I know that on energy, Senators Graham, Kerry, Lieberman have spent an awful lot of time working through an awful lot of issues.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve spent time with the President on this bill; just last week were in Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s office for a considerable period of time working through issues.\xc2\xa0 We have, with Senator Graham and Senator Schumer, worked on a number of issues relating to immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you point to the same level -- I mean, it does feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re pointing -- you feel like a lot more has been accomplished on the energy side --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- than on the immigration side.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said last week, Senator Graham and Senator Schumer came in here and asked the President to do some specific things to move immigration reform forward -- signaling his support for moving it forward via an op-ed, which we did; asking that the President himself reach out to five Republicans to try to garner additional Republican support for moving immigration forward, which those calls we made last week.</p>\n<p>I will say this -- I think we have a very good relationship on those two issues and in working through issues like Guantanamo Bay with Senator Lindsey Graham.\xc2\xa0 I think Rahm has a good relationship with him; the President has a good relationship with him; many folks here do.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the degree to which that has complicated his life, that -- in working with this administration to solve problems.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that he has heard from Republicans in the leadership and in his home state in not wanting that progress to be made with us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had said that the Chief of Staff had spoken with Senator Graham on Friday --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Senator Graham tell him, I\'m yanking my support on energy because of Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s push on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this had percolated for a while.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you guys had gotten a heads-up that he could be doing something like this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think things had percolated, yes.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President travels to the Midwest, Robert, will he be putting financial regulation on the agenda?\xc2\xa0 Is that something he will talk about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that the President will mention it at one of the town hall meetings and over the course of the time, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but just a mention rather than a full speech on this, or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- look, I think he laid out a pretty comprehensive speech just last week on the need for moving this thing forward.\xc2\xa0 I think the time for the delay on this has passed.\xc2\xa0 The time for moving this forward, having some action, is where we\'re at right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\'ll be more focused on jobs and the economy while he\xe2\x80\x99s there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ve got to tell you I don\'t -- I think anybody that lost -- any of one of the 8.4 million people that lost their jobs since this recession started, I don\'t think in their world they can divorce the risky behavior of Wall Street that caused the massive economic downturn that led to 8.5 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 So maybe if you have the luxury of not having lost your job it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to bifurcate those two issues.\xc2\xa0 I\'m pretty sure that this administration and many that lost their jobs don\'t necessarily see those as two different issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unless you\'re talking about job creation, of course.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason we\'re talking about job creation so much is because we\'re talking about 8.5 million jobs that were lost.\xc2\xa0 Again, I have a hard time separating a financial collapse that led to so many of those jobs being lost with those jobs being lost.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what led to General Jones\xe2\x80\x99s decision to issue this apology?\xc2\xa0 Did the President, the Chief of Staff, or anyone else ask him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think he -- there were inquiries, and understanding that, as he said, he wishes he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told the joke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to your opening statement on the Middle East, is there a Middle East peace process now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 An active one.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I would say that we are encouraged by the productive nature of the meetings that Senator Mitchell has had in the region, beginning late last week and into now.\xc2\xa0 So, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What have those meetings produced?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are -- the meetings have been productive in moving this process forward, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about for the past many weeks, in getting these two parties to the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the need for an atmosphere for peace in your opening statement.\xc2\xa0 What does the President feel right now are the prerequisites for that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Most of all, the President has discussed that each side has to take steps to build confidence that we can get to the table and, most importantly, that when we get there we can make some progress.\xc2\xa0 We understand this won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy.\xc2\xa0 We understand that where -- when we came into office, where this issue was, where the headlines and the news were.\xc2\xa0 The President has decided that this country and our government being actively involved in this process has tended historically to push this process forward in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s positive.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why our government will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you just one more question about -- going back to Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s questions about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s tour, will the President in any way go back to the health care reform pitch?\xc2\xa0 Will that be a theme at any of the stops?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I have not seen the final remarks.\xc2\xa0 Let me take a look at those and get back to you.\xc2\xa0 Again, I imagine that it\xe2\x80\x99s a topic that will come up.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s a specific focus of one of the stops, let me double-check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you guys could we\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying with the Midwest, the unemployment rate nationally has been stuck at 9.7 percent the last three months.\xc2\xa0 Is there any -- will we hear any new language tomorrow on him reassuring people out there on his jobs and economic policies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roger, let\xe2\x80\x99s, with all due respect, understand that I think in the last -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my chart with me -- I think if you look at the last three to five months, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the best three to five months since the beginning of -- the technical beginning of the recession in December of 2007.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say the President is satisfied.\xc2\xa0 But I think to just simply say that the rate is at a certain level doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite do justice to the fact that when we walked into the White House in January of 2009, nearly 800,000 jobs were lost that month.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nLast month, 162,000 jobs were created.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, as I mentioned to Elizabeth, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a tremendous hole to fill.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to be filled -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t filled last month; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be filled this month.\xc2\xa0 But this President made a conscious decision from the very beginning of his administration to focus on getting our economy back on track.\xc2\xa0 We are making progress.\xc2\xa0 The economy is moving in a more positive direction.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get GDP figures at the end of the week that will give us a sense of whether or not -- are we where we were in 2008 and 2009 with an economy that\'s contracted or one that\'s continuing to grow?\xc2\xa0 And I think by all accounts that is growth that has been greatly aided by the President\xe2\x80\x99s recovery plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Biden, last Friday in Pennsylvania, predicted job growth next month -- 100,000 to 200,000.\xc2\xa0 Does that sound about right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s an optimistic man, and that\'s why we like him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he further said 500,000 in the next couple of months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See previous statement.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 On one other question -- for SCOTUS, you said nothing this week.\xc2\xa0 Can you say the same for Fed governors as well as a TSA nominee?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\'t have a planning schedule in front of me, so let me -- Fed and TSA, let me check on whether I can make a similarly Shermanesque statement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me figure that out.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the President and the Israeli President discussed how to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Defense Minister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Defense Minister Barak -- discussed how to move the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s just a lot of Baracks in one room, right? (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how to move the peace process forward.\xc2\xa0 The Israeli press says they reached an agreement on doing so.\xc2\xa0 Is the Israeli press out ahead of things?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\'t want to -- I don\'t want to say that.\xc2\xa0 Let me see what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, and let me get back to you on where everything is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the presumption is that if they have reached an agreement on that, they\xe2\x80\x99ve found a way to deal with the Israeli settlement construction in East Jerusalem, and that\'s precisely where my question goes to.\xc2\xa0 Have the Israelis agreed to suspend?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything new on that.\xc2\xa0 I would simply point you, Wendell, to where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said on that in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial regulatory reform, should banks be allowed to, in effect, bet against the financial instruments they sell -- they encourage their investors to buy, as apparently --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are a whole host of provisions in these new rules obviously that will have to be married up with what the House passed that will change the way business and Wall Street work.\xc2\xa0 The President put a tremendous amount of effort behind a consumer finance protection agency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, through the Volcker rule, ensuring that the size of banks is limited, and a whole host of other tools and protections that we need for the American people.<br/>\nI don\'t want to get into the specifics of a pending inquiry from an independent agency like Goldman and the SEC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the rules grandfather some of these practices that may -- existing contracts and some of these practices that may change?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look up how that\xe2\x80\x99s handled in the current legislation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t want to address whether it should be?\xc2\xa0 Because apparently that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the negotiations right now -- Republicans saying let\xe2\x80\x99s preserve existing contracts.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see where that is on the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Supreme Court, will the President be interviewing folks this week?\xc2\xa0 And do you want to tell us which door you\xe2\x80\x99re going to sneak people in and out of?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a good story I can hardly wait to tell at the whole end of this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, come on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- don\'t allow torture.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It provides me endless delight.\xc2\xa0 There won\xe2\x80\x99t be any announcements this week because the process will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that process will include interviews this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Likely will include the President continuing to talk to prospective candidates, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In person?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are many ways to talk to prospective candidates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And might some of those be on the road this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t -- as much as I would love for you to set up a ring around the hotel --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you ruling that out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- for sheer folly, I would -- no, maybe you should -- (laughter) -- now that I think about it.\xc2\xa0 No, I know of no -- why, when we could just do it right here would we go all the way to -- go to Des Moines?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll admit that Des Moines is an easy --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one quick question on General Jones.\xc2\xa0 Did the subject of the Taliban joke come up during his meeting with Defense Minister Barak?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he didn\xe2\x80\x99t apologize to him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it came up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President still meeting with the debt commission tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is, and I will have a statement after that meeting for you all to cover tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is his charge to them still that everything is on the table, from Social Security to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See, this is -- I get to do my now weekly thing, which is all of you are now -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve gripped your computers and your Blackberrys to quickly Twitter that Robert Gibbs, per the Washington game, didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that Barack Obama has said X, Y, Z is on the table.\xc2\xa0 Again, I appreciate this -- apparently it keeps us all quite busy.\xc2\xa0 We can tweet all Twitter, but I would simply say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You really don\xe2\x80\x99t see the significance of that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I got somebody to play along with my Washington game.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is saying that he may break his most fundamental promise, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And he may not.\xc2\xa0 Story at 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he may.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have caught a large fish on my troll of the Washington game.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but the thing is, when you\xe2\x80\x99re definitive you\xe2\x80\x99re definitive.\xc2\xa0 And then when you\xe2\x80\x99re not, we\xe2\x80\x99re playing the game?\xc2\xa0 I mean, come on.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re playing the game --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re playing the game whenever you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- every single day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- don\xe2\x80\x99t come out there and be definitive?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Every single day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 But you never play the game?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not nearly as well as you do, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 You got a whole cable show to do it with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as this entrepreneurial conference is going on at the Reagan Building and also at the same time BBC world opinion poll, what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 image has grown upwards during President\xe2\x80\x99s first year.\xc2\xa0 And also, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s image also has been up around the globe, including it\xe2\x80\x99s very much high in India but very low in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you as far as this entrepreneurial conference is going on and also World Bank and IMF meetings just ended, do you think that this is another message from the President to these people who have come from around the globe?\xc2\xa0 And also, many -- for many, many years Africa was ignored and U.S. was not paying much attention to Africa, which has so much minerals, oil.\xc2\xa0 Now China is getting into it.\xc2\xa0 Where do we go from here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- you left me a lot of running room there, Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just say yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the conference that\'s going on today is a commitment that the President made out of the speech in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this President has dedicated a lot of time to repairing and restoring our image around the world; being seen as constructive, willing to engage.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress on issues like North Korea and Iran in the international community.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that, Goyal, the poll that you referred to, more and more people around the world view the United States more positively.</p>\n<p>Even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a ways to go in a place like Pakistan, there\xe2\x80\x99s also, over the course of the past many months, an increase in how we\xe2\x80\x99re viewed.\xc2\xa0 And I think all of that makes the job that the President has to do internationally that much easier to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally on immigration, now it has become also a really global image or issue for the U.S. because -- like what is happening in Arizona -- an issue also of human rights and civil rights.\xc2\xa0 And many illegal immigrants now wish -- they are hoping that President Obama will bring this issue to an end, so to make them legal --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that whether -- regardless of which side of this issue that you\xe2\x80\x99re on, I think that we all agree that something has to be done.\xc2\xa0 Something has to be done that addresses the comprehensive set of concerns.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the only thing that will work on this is to address what is going on in our borders, what is going on in our workplaces, and what is going on in and out of the shadows.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think by working on this and seeking a comprehensive solution in a bipartisan way, we have the opportunity to not just make progress, but I will say this, it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- again, I think one of the things that the Arizona law highlights is without the United States from the federal level being involved, you have very much what could be 50 immigration laws, because without us acting, we\xe2\x80\x99ve deferred to the states.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has said, and I think leaders in Arizona certainly on both sides of this issue have said, that this is a wake-up call for the federal government to act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you may know, Robert, the U.K. is in the middle of the first-time-ever live televised leaders\xe2\x80\x99 debates.\xc2\xa0 And someone who has emerged victoriously from a mind-numbing 30-plus debates, does the President or yourself have anything, any comments, without getting political or picking any candidates --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or playing the game?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any advice or any thoughts, in fact, if any of you here in the White House has seen it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They call them London games.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we spent a lot of time --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this good for democracy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I tend to believe it is.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether\xc2\xa0 -- I don\'t know what the inflection point between three and 30 is, but I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, there is a process that everyone can see that requires each candidate to ask and answer questions, or be asked and answer questions.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President will return this week to Iowa where the process begins with a series of community meetings that helps you build support.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nBut I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I watched a little of last week\xe2\x80\x99s debate; they\xe2\x80\x99re fascinating to watch.\xc2\xa0 They remind me of how nerve-wracking I thought the entire process was when we got to the general election, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99re valuable and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad somebody else besides me is going through them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you watch the Sky News debate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Whatever one that -- nice shameless product plug.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the deficit commission tomorrow, what does the President think of the Senate budget committee?\xc2\xa0 Kent Conrad and Democrats have passed a budget that would get to the President\xe2\x80\x99s target faster than he would, or the commission would.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- let me get something from OMB on that.\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve not spent a lot of time setting what their target was.</p>\n<p>Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, David --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what -- they\xe2\x80\x99re getting some lawsuits filed against Arizona.\xc2\xa0 What are the chances that the Obama administration will join in these lawsuits?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, David, again, the Department of Justice, per the President\xe2\x80\x99s request, is looking into and studying the implications of the law.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as we have something on that, as soon as that review is done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you assess the political impact of joining such a lawsuit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President believes, as you heard him say just last Friday, that this is a -- the President simply believes this is a fundamentally unfair law and has asked the Department of Justice to look into it.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t -- I think the President has weighed in on what he thinks is right, which is what he tends to do.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The South Korean minister said that a torpedo likely caused the sinking of a ship.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House been in touch with the South Korea government over this?\xc2\xa0 And if it turns out that it was a North Korean torpedo, how would the White House respond, and how would you advise the South Koreans to respond?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stephen, the United States has been assisting in the investigation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into hypotheticals at this point.\xc2\xa0 We obviously would look -- refer you to them on the current investigation and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say when they have completed that investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me, Les.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, sure, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I just have one question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have two.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a big microphone, so I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick with you, though, David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Last week in the speech that the President gave up at New York City at Cooper Union, he talked about how Republicans were saying things about the financial reform bill that were not true involving the bailout, in his perspective, and he also decried the battalions of lobbyists that have been sent to defeat the bill.\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House position that the Republicans in Congress are actively in league with Wall Street lobbyists to try to just block the bill altogether?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you know where the President stands on moving forward with this legislation.\xc2\xa0 Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re\xc2\xa0 -- for whatever reason you\xe2\x80\x99re blocking stronger rules from going into effect, you\xe2\x80\x99re not acting -- the President would believe not acting in the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest, whatever -- for whatever motive you might have.\xc2\xa0 We saw the effects of what happens when we don\xe2\x80\x99t have strong regulation in place.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at the mercy of decision-making this isn\xe2\x80\x99t always in our own best interest.\xc2\xa0 Wall Street reform will change that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, yes, you were coming back to me.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 National Review reports that there are now 41 Republican candidates for Congress who are black.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of this?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what is his reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I am not aware that his National Review has been delivered, so -- (laughter) -- it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of that fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Boston Herald has deplored the fact that liberal Democrats in Congress have earmarked over $68 million in taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money for a Boston memorial to Senator Ted Kennedy.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support this expenditure?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen any information on that but I\xe2\x80\x99d happy to take a look at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s there in the Boston Herald.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take a look at it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Then-senator Obama filibustered or supported a filibuster of Judge Sam Alito.\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans have cited that as justification for a possible filibuster against his nominee.\xc2\xa0 Is that fair?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- the President is in the process right now of picking a nominee.\xc2\xa0 I think our hope is that, just like Justice Sotomayor, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a nominee that will enjoy bipartisan support from a great number in total on both sides.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get into tactics and such when we get closer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed frustration about Republican filibusters of candidates who were then confirmed on a bipartisan basis, which is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pick somebody -- my sense is the President is going to pick somebody that can garner bipartisan support, that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a battle?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be those, regardless of who\xe2\x80\x99s picked, that won\xe2\x80\x99t fight.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will pick somebody, though, that can garner broad bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two quick questions on the climate change issue.\xc2\xa0 Just before, you mentioned that the Senate Republican leadership has been pressuring Senator Graham, I assume, on a number of issues not to work with the White House and other Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a sense of what evidence you have that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I said I think he\xe2\x80\x99s taken a lot of heat for -- both in Washington and in South Carolina, for trying to work on a set of issues in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 Look, last fall one of the largest county Republican parties in all of South Carolina -- I forget the exact term that they used -- \xe2\x80\x9crebuked\xe2\x80\x9d or what have you, his participation on some of these bipartisan issues.<br/>\nI think that demonstrates that there are those that, regardless of the willingness of people like Lindsey Graham to courageously make progress and work with the other side of the aisle on a host of issues, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other question is just about -- it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the real hang-up here in the Senate has to do with Senator Reid, who has made it pretty clear to people internally that he\xe2\x80\x99s not intending on putting immigration reform at the head of the queue.\xc2\xa0 Has the President or any of the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, not putting it at the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not planning on putting -- I\'m sorry, planning on putting climate change in front of immigration reform at the head of the queue.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just say this -- I think the President believes strongly that we can make good progress on each one of those issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that seems to be the impasse.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any discussion with Senator Reid about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, but I can see.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Friday at the gaggle the question came up about the oilrig in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And you said it had been plugged, which it had at the time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s since come unplugged; it\xe2\x80\x99s leaking from two different places.\xc2\xa0 Does this give the White House pause about the President\xe2\x80\x99s offshore oil drilling program?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, let me say this.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, we have -- the Coast Guard has been directing the response to the leaking.\xc2\xa0 We -- that\xe2\x80\x99s our foremost priority at this point, is doing all that we can to prevent further leaking and to stop any environmental impacts, obviously that getting to shore, a host of other things that are complicated by things like the weather.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President outlined a plan that, as a result of the end of the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf, to set forth areas that can be examined for further drilling.\xc2\xa0 As part of that process, a whole host of issues like whether it\xe2\x80\x99s environmentally feasible will be looked at and undertaken as part of that process.</p>\n<p>The type of accident that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, the magnitude of it, is something that is rare, but demands our attention.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of our efforts right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up again, would you agree that opening the coast from Delaware to Florida, the Atlantic Coast, would appear to be less environmentally sure or safe because of this accident?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to balance that on a whole host of things like what\xe2\x80\x99s the impact of getting more oil from dangerous parts of the world; what are the environmental impacts of all of that?\xc2\xa0 Again, Bill, that\xe2\x80\x99s to say that the plan that the President outlined will examine a whole host of issues in areas that are designated to be -- that have been re-designated for the possibility of increased drilling.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:15 P.M.
