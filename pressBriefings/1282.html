AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE,<br/>\n\tAND<br/>\n\tSENIOR DIRECTOR OF MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS SAMANTHA POWER<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tVia Conference Call</p>\n<p>3:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CHANG:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for waiting and thanks for joining our call today.\xc2\xa0 We have three senior officials joining us on the call right now:\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Susan Rice, our Permanent Representative to the United Nations; Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; and Samantha Power, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director of Multilateral Affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThey will be on the record, going over the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to New York to attend a variety of U.N. meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that, I\'ll hand it over to Ben Rhodes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just take this opportunity to walk you through the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule at the U.N. General Assembly this year, and I\'ll also just say off the bat that these are occasionally fluid in the sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of business that we have to do up there, so if there are any additions or changes to the schedule between now and the end of the week we\'ll certainly let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But currently, we\'re planning to go up to New York on Wednesday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 The President will arrive and go directly to the United Nations building where he will deliver remarks at the Millennium Development Goals Conference that\'s being hosted at the United Nations this year.\xc2\xa0 His remarks will focus on what the United States is doing in pursuit of achieving the Millennium Development goals and focus on some of the key initiatives of our development policy writ large.\xc2\xa0 So that will be an important opportunity for the President to address America\xe2\x80\x99s approach to development and our commitment to the Millennium Development goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThen he\'ll have a very busy day on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 It will begin with the President\xe2\x80\x99s address to the U.N. General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more details on the speech, obviously, as we get closer to Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say by way of a preview that this is an opportunity for the President to speak broadly about America\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for him to really cover the waterfront of what we have done to date in the first 20 months of this administration to renew American leadership in the world, with particular focus on issues that are of great concern to the American people, such as our efforts to restart the global economy, to combat al Qaeda, to advance the cause of nonproliferation, and to pursue Middle East peace.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe\'ll also have the ability to look forward and to lay out in broad strokes what the United States is -- what the purpose of American leadership is in the world, as we continue to promote both peace and security and prosperity, but also democracy and human rights around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMoving on from there, the President will have a bilateral meeting with Premier Wen of China.\xc2\xa0 This continues a very regular and high-level series of consultations that we have had with the Chinese, and the constructive and comprehensive relationship that we\'ve forged with China over the first 20 months of the administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom there, the President will attend a luncheon hosted by the U.N. Secretary General, and will be able, on the margins of that luncheon, to also meet briefly with the President of the U.N. General Assembly and the Secretary General.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter that, in the afternoon, the President will be going to the Clinton Global Initiative, where he will be introducing the First Lady who will then be making more extended remarks to the Clinton Global Initiative.\xc2\xa0 And the President, knowing that the First Lady was going to speak there, wanted to be sure he had the opportunity to introduce her.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter he leaves CGI, the President will have a bilateral meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 This follows up on the good bilateral meeting that they had when they were at the G20 in Toronto.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to visiting Japan, of course, in November, and thinks that this is one of our most important alliances in the world and the nation with which we cooperate on a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to the discussions with Prime Minister Kan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThen that evening, the President will be hosting a reception at the Natural History Museum, the annual reception that we have for participants in the U.N. General Assembly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t; Friday, the President has a couple of bilats and a couple of multilateral meetings as well.\xc2\xa0 In the morning, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with the President of Azerbaijan, who\xe2\x80\x99s been a critical partner with the United States on a range of issues, including our efforts in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with the President of Colombia, who is obviously one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most important allies and closest friends in this hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very much looking forward to this opportunity to congratulate President Santos on his recent inauguration and discuss ways that we can strengthen our bilateral relationship going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen the President will be hosting a luncheon of the ASEAN leaders.\xc2\xa0 This continues the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to deepen America\xe2\x80\x99s engagement with Asia more broadly.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Asia is absolutely fundamental to a number of our key priorities, for instance, our commitment to double U.S. exports and to deepen our security partnerships in this important part of the world.\xc2\xa0 So, building on the outreach the President did last year, he wanted to host the 10 ASEAN leaders for this luncheon and to discuss ways in which we can coordinate more closely going forward.\xc2\xa0 And this focus on Asia will, of course, continue, again, in November when the President is planning to travel to Asia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen the President will move to a multilateral meeting on Sudan.\xc2\xa0 This is an important meeting that the Secretary General is convening to make sure that the international community is fully coordinated in ensuring that we can move towards a successful referendum early next year, while also continuing to do all that we can on behalf of the people of Darfur.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, finally, the President will have his final bilateral meeting, and this will be with the President of Kyrgyzstan.\xc2\xa0 And again, the United States has provided humanitarian and diplomatic support for the people of Kyrgyzstan as they have sought to work through a very difficult period of time and establish a democracy that works for the rights and opportunities of their citizens.\xc2\xa0 So the President wanted to take this opportunity at the U.N. General Assembly to speak with the President of Kyrgyzstan and underscore our ongoing commitment to the Kyrgyz people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, I\'ll hand it over to Susan Rice, our very, very, very capable ambassador to the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 And just say, by way of introduction to Susan, who can walk through kind of what the atmosphere is at the United Nations, that this administration has pursued a range of our very top priorities through the U.N., whether it\xe2\x80\x99s nonproliferation, counterterrorism or other issues.\xc2\xa0 And Susan, of course, has very capably managed a very broad and accurate portfolio. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, Susan, why don\'t you take it away?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 This year\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the U.N. General Assembly comes as we have successfully and dramatically changed our course at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve ended needless American isolation.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve worked to repair what were some badly frayed relationships and scrapped outdated positions.\xc2\xa0 And in the process, we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a strong basis for cooperation that advances our security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re very much involved in the critical work of reforming and transforming the United Nations to make it more cost-effective, transparent, and responsive.\xc2\xa0 This is all part and parcel of what President Obama has frequently called a \xe2\x80\x9cnew era of engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And what we have worked to do is make that tangible in terms of results at the U.N. that make Americans safer and help us create a more peaceful and prosperous world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBen mentioned that we have been able to utilize coalitions and partnerships at the U.N. to advance the most important aspects of our national security policy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made real strides on nonproliferation and counterterrorism, but obviously, very importantly, on Iran and North Korea, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to strengthen the sanctions regimes in place and make them tougher than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been, and to build on those regimes with separate actions, both bilaterally and among like-minded groups like the EU and Japan and South Korea, so that the pressure is mounting and our dual-track approaches have teeth and increased prospects for progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.N. missions are playing critical roles in backstopping the political processes, supporting elections, dealing with humanitarian issues, development and the fate of IDPs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been instrumental in strengthening both those missions, their leadership and their effectiveness, and they\'re playing very important roles in service of our shared goals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also strengthened critical peacekeeping missions and supported urgent development efforts in places from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo, to Sudan, Liberia, Lebanon and elsewhere.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the last year, there have been some notable changes and successes.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. played a leading role in establishing a new entity called U.N. Women.\xc2\xa0 Former President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has just been named to head this entity, which will consolidate what were previously four different U.N. agencies and organizations dealing with issues related to women, elevating them, streamlining them, and saving resources.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also over the course of last year had a successful NPT review conference.\xc2\xa0 In contrast to the previous conference, we were driving the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of what is called a global field support strategy for peacekeeping, which will speed deployment of operations and allow for greater efficiencies and cost savings going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also had critical negotiations over the U.N. budget, holding the U.S. share constant against great pressure from partners to force the American taxpayer to pay more. We\xe2\x80\x99ve resisted that.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked constructively on the Millennium Development Goals summit outcome document, which will be the centerpiece of the program adopted this week at the MDG summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just end by saying that we know very well that changing the way the U.N. operates and making it perform more effectively and efficiently is not an easy task.\xc2\xa0 It never will be and it certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that every day our efforts at reform are having a real impact and they\xe2\x80\x99re helping to break down entrenched divides between North and South, developed and developing countries, and old blocs such that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to forge coalitions time and again that serve U.S. interests in the way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve just briefly summarized.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, Ben.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Susan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBefore we take your questions, Samantha Power, Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs here at the White House and a close advisor of the President, will just give a brief preview of our Sudan multilateral meet. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSamantha.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. POWERS:\xc2\xa0 Great. Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 On the date that the Sudan event occurs -- and this is an event hosted by the Secretary General of the U.N., attended by the Chairman of the African Union and a range of other very senior multilateral officials -- it will be September 24th, and there will be fewer than 110 days to go before the critical referenda are to take place for the people of South Sudan and the people in the Abyei region of Sudan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President decided to participate in this event, which was actually at one point originally intended as a ministerial, because this could not be a more critical time in the life of Sudan and also in the life of international efforts to ensure that these referenda go off on time and peacefully.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s participation has already increased the representation from around the world.\xc2\xa0 A number of other heads of state are now attending who weren\xe2\x80\x99t before.\xc2\xa0 The parties -- Vice President Taha from the government of Sudan, and the President of South Sudan Salva Kiir -- will both be in attendance.\xc2\xa0 And this event will give the President an opportunity to deliver his own personal message to the parties in a series of remarks.\xc2\xa0 And these will be quite substantial remarks on Sudan and on his vision for how to go forward there.\xc2\xa0 But moreover, it gives the opportunity for the international community to stand together again and send a very forceful message at a critical make-or-break time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that the parties, in any conflict, but in this one, as well, have often thought to play countries within the international community off one another, and this is an event that will show that the world is united and that the parties need to move very, very briskly and responsibly to ensure that these votes take place on time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today, and thank you for your service.\xc2\xa0 This question is directed at Ms. Power and Ms. Rice.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you could please explain what the President\xe2\x80\x99s message will be in the meeting on Sudan?\xc2\xa0 Also, do you believe that enough pressures have been brought to bear on the government in Khartoum in order to ensure that they will take the steps necessary to have a free and fair election?\xc2\xa0 And what sanctions or pressures, if any, would be brought to bear, and under what circumstances?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. POWER:\xc2\xa0 I can start, maybe, and, Susan, do you want to follow up?\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on my earlier remarks, again, the number one message is with regard to the CPA and the need for rapid implementation.\xc2\xa0 The parties are behind schedule.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re aware of that.\xc2\xa0 Everybody is aware of that.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, this event we always intended as an action-forcing event, and indeed in the last two weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen more progress in terms of sending voter material to the right committee and technical fixes in the inauguration of the Secretary General for the referendum commission, et cetera, than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in several months beforehand.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen, with Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s help, a press statement out of New York that, again, shows the unity of the international community.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the number one message is that these referenda must go off on time, that they must be peaceful, and they must reflect the will of the people of South Sudan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Additionally, of course, we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced some very -- a spike in violence in Darfur.\xc2\xa0 We continue to see unacceptable conditions for the people living in camps and the fact that they -- none of them feel safe enough to return to their homes.\xc2\xa0 So he will, of course, speak to the need for enhanced security and dignity for the people of Darfur and the need for accountability, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition, because this event is being held at the U.N., he will place an emphasis, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, on humanitarian access and the importance of peacekeepers and aid workers being allowed the mobility, the security, and the access they need to do their jobs and to improve the welfare of the people both in Darfur and in South Sudan and beyond.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 And let me just add -- thanks, Sam -- I would echo everything she said, and just add that at this critical moment in the run-up to the referenda, we are reminding the parties that it is, first and foremost, their responsibility to implement the commitments they have made under the CPA and to their people.\xc2\xa0 And we are there, with others from the international community, to spur them and support them as they do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re also trying to clarify the choices for both sides and make it clear, using all the tools at our disposal, that there are opportunities for a better future, for improvements in their relationships with the United States and the international community, if they fully and faithfully meet their obligations under the CPA and with respect to the government on Darfur.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make the upside opportunity clear and well understood.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been clear that if they fail to follow through, that there will be -- as we have always said in the context of our policy -- consequences.\xc2\xa0 Those might take the form of unilateral and/or multilateral, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a number that are potentially at our disposal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut our aim is to spur them forward in their own interest, consistent with their own commitments, and to be supportive of the parties as they do so in the critical time where the stakes are high for the people of Sudan, for the region and, indeed, for international peace and security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thank you for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could elaborate a little on the topics of discussion for the President\xe2\x80\x99s bilateral with Chinese Premier Wen, and especially whether the leaders plan to discuss Iran and the effects of international sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that for starters, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Again, first of all, the President has engaged repeatedly with his Chinese counterparts, President Hu, and in this instance, Premier Wen, on a very broad agenda. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very clear view of the U.S.-China relationship, which is that it is one of the absolutely most important bilateral relationships in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essential for dealing with a range of challenges; that we can build constructive and positive cooperation on issues where we have common interests, where there are many, while also disagreeing on those issues where we differ.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the issues that will be addressed, I would say that this meeting will build on the bilateral meetings that the President had over many months and the consultations he and his team have had through the strengthen and economic dialogue.\xc2\xa0 That would, of course, include nonproliferation and it would include Iran.\xc2\xa0 Chinese support was very critical to the resolution that Susan helped take the lead in negotiating up in New York, which sent a very clear message to Iran that there are consequences for its actions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn fact, the President, in his speech last year at the U.N., said very clearly that we were extending Iran the opportunity of a better relationship with the United States and the international community should it live up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 The President also said last year at the U.N. that there needed to be consequences for Iran if it didn\'t meet those obligations, because, again, international law must mean something.\xc2\xa0 And Iran\xe2\x80\x99s continued violations of the NPT and failure to live up to its nonproliferation obligations needed to lead to consequences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered on that.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Security Council resolution with, again, uniform support from the P-5, delivered the first round of those consequences, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some follow-on national actions from the United States and likeminded partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo Iran will be one topic of discussion, but it will be among many.\xc2\xa0 As is usually the case in our relationship with China, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly address the global economy and our ongoing coordination with the Chinese and many other nations to ensure balance and sustainable growth that can create jobs and lasting economic growth in our country and around the world.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll also address non-proliferation broadly, which would include not just Iran but, of course, North Korea and its need to live up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming trip where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to engage further with China at the G20 and APEC.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I expect there to be a broad agenda at his bilateral meeting and I expect it to build on the kinds of talks he\xe2\x80\x99s had with the Chinese since coming into office, while also setting the table for some of the work that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing at the G20 and APEC out in Asia in November.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for doing this.\xc2\xa0 My question is to Ben.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to rally support, international support, for his new peace effort as part of the UNGA speech or his bilats?\xc2\xa0 And does he intend to touch base or in bilateral meetings meet with President -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas or Prime Minister Netanyahu while in New York?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 I think the short answer is, yes, the President of course believes that Middle East peace is in the interest of the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of Israel, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of Palestinians, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also in the interest of the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the message that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to deliver is the same one that he referenced at the launching of direct talks the beginning of September, which is that this is a moment of opportunity and it\xe2\x80\x99s a moment of opportunity that needs to be seized. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe all know the obstacles to peace.\xc2\xa0 We all know that there are rejectionists who will try to disrupt the process.\xc2\xa0 And we all know that there are hurdles as a part of the process, and that the parties themselves need to take difficult steps in pursuit of peace; the United States needs to do what we can to support the movement towards peace; but that the region and the international community also has a role to play here in supporting the direct talks that are taking place and the ultimate goal of two states, Israel and Palestinian, living side by side in peace and security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that will be a part of his comments before the General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that given the interest in this issue around the world, it would not surprise me if it came up as part of his bilateral consultations in a number of these bilateral meetings.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been something that has been on the mind of a number of the leaders that the President has spoken with recently.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I do think it will be a topic of conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of meetings, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything currently scheduled.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the last round of direct talks just concluded in Sharm el Sheikh, with Secretary Clinton representing the United States, along with Senator Mitchell, meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would have to defer to the Israelis and the Palestinians about the schedule of their leaders.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you abreast of any additions that are made to our schedule, but currently the President is not planning on holding specific meetings with the two leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNext question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for taking the call.\xc2\xa0 This is a quick question for Ben, just to follow up on the China and Japan bilat, and it goes to issue of the economy.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect currency manipulation and currency intervention to come up in connection with his meetings with either of those leaders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I do just want to underscore, again, the importance that the President places on Asia broadly as a part of our economic agenda.\xc2\xa0 We believe very strongly that, again, initiatives such as our export initiative and our efforts to promote balanced and sustainable growth through the G20 must hinge in good part on our relations with Asia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that accounts for the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s, again, a strong Asian representation in the bilateral meetings he\xe2\x80\x99s having and in the multilateral meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99s hosting with the ASEAN countries, because, again, this just is not simply a bilateral issue, in terms of economic growth and deepening our economic relations, commercial relationships in Asia.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just see it as a bilateral issue with China or Japan.\xc2\xa0 He sees it as a regional issue, which is why, in addition to meeting with the two largest economies in Asia, China and Japan, we\xe2\x80\x99re also hosting this meeting of the ASEAN leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith specific regard to currency, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of our ongoing discussions with the Chinese, in terms of our efforts, again, to ensure that growth is balanced and sustained. I\'d refer you to the specific comments that Secretary Geithner made the other day about currency as the clearest representation of our position on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And actually I believe the President addressed it today, too, at the CNBC Town Hall.\xc2\xa0 But suffice to say in terms of our broader dialogue about, again, how to foster balanced, sustainable growth, it will be a part of the discussions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNext question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much for doing this.\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on the reference to Iran that I think you made, Ben, and I think the Ambassador made, as well.\xc2\xa0 As you said, last year, the President issued both an invitation for engagement and a warning about the price to be paid.\xc2\xa0 So the sanctions are in effect now.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure I understand yet what his message going forward is.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to discuss escalating costs if there are continued defiance of the U.N. resolutions, or not?\xc2\xa0 And if you could answer the same question on North Korea.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99d make some comments and I\xe2\x80\x99d invite Susan to, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d just say, first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth reflecting back, as you know, David, and I think reviewing the trajectory of this over the course of the last year because last year at this point in time, the United States -- it was right about the time that we were pursuing the possibility of a competence-building measure through the TRR.\xc2\xa0 Iran never fully followed through on the commitments that they had made to the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 We had said that we were going to pursue sanctions and accountability measures.\xc2\xa0 There was some doubt as to whether or not, one, those measures could really get through the United Nations, and, two, whether they\xe2\x80\x99d have any serious bite to them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in a very methodical way is lay out an escalating series of consequences for the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 The foundation of that, of course, was the U.N. Security Counsel resolution that my colleague negotiated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the follow-on measures that have been taken by the United States, by our European allies, by our Japanese, Korean, Australian allies, and a number of nations and private sector entities around the world, have created a situation where the cost that Iran is facing is even greater than it expected with regard to sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen that in some of the public comments out of Iran. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so right now, we are in a phase where the effect of these sanctions is becoming clear to the Iranian government; the cost of their continued failure to live up to their obligations is becoming clear to the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 So I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important, again, to -- given the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the summer putting these sanctions in place -- to, again, emphasize and underscore that cost.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, frankly, that cost will grow on its own as banks, as private sector entities see the cost of doing business in Iran go up.\xc2\xa0 I think you are already seeing a kind of natural escalation of how those sanctions are imposed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat said, in terms of your question as to how the President intends to talk about this, I think he intends to make very clear what he has always said, which is that the door is open to the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 The door is open to engagement.\xc2\xa0 The door is open to them having a better relationship with the United States and with the international community.\xc2\xa0 However, in order to walk through that door, Iran is going to have to demonstrate its commitment to show its peaceful intent around its nuclear program and to meet its obligations to the international community under the NPT and a range of U.N. Security Counsel resolutions. So I think the President again will want to underscore and continue to underscore that this is a dual-track approach.\xc2\xa0 Sanctions are not an end in themselves.\xc2\xa0 They\'re a means of holding Iran accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, Iran has that opportunity to take another course. And I think the U.N. is a useful forum to underscore that point because our case has always been that this is not a bilateral irritant.\xc2\xa0 The United States is not imposing sanctions on Iran because we have a bilateral grievance with Iran.\xc2\xa0 We and the international community are enforcing sanctions because they are violating international law and international obligations, again, most clearly the NPT and U.N. Security Counsel resolutions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an issue between Iran and the international community, and that\'s kind of the core of our case. So I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be both extending that hand of engagement to the Iranians, and that opportunity of engagement to the Iranians, while also underscoring that there are growing consequences as we demonstrated should they not live up to those obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t know if you have anything to add to that, having negotiated the resolution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Ben, that was very comprehensive.\xc2\xa0 The only thing I would underscore is just how serious the effect that these sanctions -- both the U.N. Security Counsel Resolution 1929, which was both broad and deep in its impact, and the subsequent measures that came from the Europeans our Asian allies and others, as well as our own actions from Congress, are actually having -- the impact we are seeing in some very concrete and meaningful ways. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as Ben said, it\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to be acknowledged even in the domestic political debate inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that these measures will increasingly influence the course that the Iranian decision-makers pursue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing I wanted to add is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue during this week at the General Assembly to coordinate very closely with our P5-plus-1 partners who are here, whom we\xe2\x80\x99ll met as we traditionally do at the ministerial level.\xc2\xa0 And that will be an opportunity both to take stock of where we are on both sides of the pressure track -- the dual-track approach, the pressure side, as well as engagement and to speak in one voice and to make clear to the Iranians, as my colleague said, that they do face a choice and that they have the opportunity to improve relations with the international community, should they choose to stand up and meet their obligation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Susan, I forgot to get into North Korea, and you may want to, as well.\xc2\xa0 The only thing I\'d say on North Korea is, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s similar in the sense that the same rules apply, in terms of North Korea needs to meets its obligations in terms of, again, both the international community but also the commitments its made to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis will be a subject, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, again, not just in the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments but in his bilateral meetings with Japan and China, who are of course members of the six parties. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, Susan, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the middle of the North Korea situation, too, so I don\'t know if you have anything to add to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 No, Ben, I won\xe2\x80\x99t add anything on this one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I take it there will be no bilats with any ASEAN members?\xc2\xa0 And when will the President follow up Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion in Hanoi to ASEAN members with these claims to the disputed territories in the South China Sea, that they should deal collectively with China, to settle the disputes?\xc2\xa0 And how long is the U.S. ASEAN meeting scheduled for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Let me just address a number of those.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we do not have currently scheduled any bilateral meetings on the margins of the ASEAN meeting.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the President wanted to take the opportunity of getting all the leaders together to have a discussion about a range of issues that are important to the United States and to the ASEAN countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe meeting is currently scheduled for two hours, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a long meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the longest meeting we have scheduled probably, actually.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s so the President could relay his views and how important he believes ASEAN is, and the relationship between the United States and ASEAN to the future of Asia and to critical priorities to the United States as the ASEAN countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the President will have the opportunity to, again, speak to each of the leaders in a kind of formal and informal basis over lunch as well.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyed the ties that he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to forge with a number of the ASEAN leaders, including the leader of the Philippines, which is, of course, one of America\xe2\x80\x99s very close friends and allies in that part of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith regard to the South China Sea, I would expect it would be an issue that will come up.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an issue of interest and concern to the ASEAN countries and to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton, as you said, articulated some very important views during her recent meetings with ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 And so I do believe the President will follow on those discussions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd part of the reason why we -- in Japan last year, the President said that he wanted to reengage basically an Asian architecture and the Asian economic and security architecture in organizations such as ASEAN and APEC is because the United States had been absent.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been an empty chair at the table or we have not fully engaged in these organizations for a number of years, particularly as we were focused on other priorities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, given the centrality of Asia to America\xe2\x80\x99s priorities, we believed that it was essential not just to strengthen those core alliances which are the foundation of our engagement with Asia, and not just to deepen our cooperation with countries like China, who of course are so important to the range of priorities for the world, but to engage in a very serious way with these regional organizations, because the President believes that they can play an important role in coordinating our efforts on the economic and security side.\xc2\xa0 ASEAN, of course, often focused on a range of economic issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage APEC.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be a very strong voice in the dialogue about the future of Asian architecture as it relates to both political and security and economic issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t know if Susan -- do you have anything to add kind of on the Asia front or by way of close?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Just to underscore that as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly in this call, the relationships that we have and are continuing to build in Asia, both with ASEAN countries and the region more broadly, are crucial to our overall foreign and national security policy.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re very central to the work we do at the United Nations, both on the Security Council and the General Assembly, where our partnerships and alliances serve us every day on issues of core importance to our national security, and our efforts to advance respect for democracy and human rights, and the important work of reform that we do here at the United Nations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do is, again, we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a very robust set of briefings up in New York.\xc2\xa0 The President, of course -- I should have added, we basically anticipate, for most of these bilateral meetings, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make comments at the top of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing from the President a lot throughout the course of the week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI forgot one important event, which is, in addition to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, I just want to underscore -- and some of you may have received some of this guidance -- the First Lady, as I mentioned, is speaking at CGI.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll be joining the President at the reception at the National History Museum. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then on Friday she\xe2\x80\x99ll be hosting a special event for the spouses of those chiefs of delegations and heads of government who are participating in the UNGA at the Stone Barn Center, which is a non-profit farm and education center north of New York City.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this of course continues the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s focus on nutrition, sustainable food, and children\xe2\x80\x99s education.\xc2\xa0 And this builds on some of the conversations she\xe2\x80\x99s had with her counterparts, including at a dinner that was hosted at the Pittsburgh G20 summit at a working farm that addressed some of these similar issues.\xc2\xa0 So the First Lady will be hosting her counterparts at this event on Friday, again, around the notion of sustainable food and nutrition and children\xe2\x80\x99s education.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in touch with you all throughout the course of the week.\xc2\xa0 UNGA things inevitably may change or slide a little bit, or a meeting may get added.\xc2\xa0 So if any of that happens, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated.\xc2\xa0 But meanwhile, looking forward to seeing some of you in New York.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t4:14 P.M.
