Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t2:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We apologize for the delay, but we are glad that you\xe2\x80\x99re here and welcome you as ever to the briefing room for your daily briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I think was advertised, I have with me Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on my right, and to my left, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rich Cordray.\xc2\xa0 They\'re here to talk to you about student loans and college costs.\xc2\xa0 They participated in a roundtable just earlier this afternoon that was led by the Vice President with a number of presidents of colleges and universities to discuss ways to provide students with more transparency about college costs to help them make very important financial decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is first turn it over to Secretary Duncan and then Director Cordray.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you about these issues, this bucket of issues.\xc2\xa0 If you could direct questions to them on their issues at the top, after which we\xe2\x80\x99ll let them leave, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here to take your questions on other subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that I give you the Secretary of Education.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks so much, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And thanks, all of you guys, for giving us the opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs all of you know, post-secondary education is the ticket to economic success in America.\xc2\xa0 But while it\xe2\x80\x99s never been more important to have a degree or certificate, unfortunately it\xe2\x80\x99s also never been more expensive.\xc2\xa0 The Obama administration is working every single day to do our part to keep college affordable by helping students better manage their debt after graduation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also proposed to extend and make permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit and to create new incentives for states and institutions to keep college costs from escalating and to increase those completion rates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re also working to provide parents of students with the information they need to make smart educational decisions so that they can know before they owe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEach year, colleges and universities send prospective students and their parents financial aid award letters, intended to lay out how much it will cost them to attend school.\xc2\xa0 But as you guys know, these letters often look different, contain different information and often, frankly, do a poor job of making clear how much a student will receive in terms of grants and scholarships, and how much they\'ll have to borrow in terms of student loans.\xc2\xa0 This not only makes it difficult to figure out how much college will cost, it also makes comparison shopping almost impossible.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have the best system of higher education in the world, over 6,000 institutions of higher education.\xc2\xa0 So that situation now makes no sense to me.\xc2\xa0 I just fundamentally think we have to empower parents and students to make a good choice.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'ve been working so hard on designing an easy-to-use form that standardizes this information and makes the true cost of higher education much more transparent.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe plan to have it available in the beginning of the upcoming school year of this fall, and we hope that it will be voluntarily adopted by the higher education community.\xc2\xa0 This is, frankly, not rocket science.\xc2\xa0 However, I think it is a triumph of common sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn advance of that, we\'re pleased today to announce that leaders from 10 universities have already voluntarily adopted five data elements from our shopping sheet proposal.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll provide much greater transparency for prospective students and families.\xc2\xa0 And these 10 university presidents, who we just met with -- it\'s a fantastic group -- I want to thank them for their leadership, their courage and their commitment.\xc2\xa0 And those 10 colleges by themselves represent over 1.4 million students -- fully 5 percent of the higher ed community -- so very significant players at the table today and a huge amount of energy and enthusiasm in the room.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of these institutions have pledged to provide every incoming student for the 2013-2014 school year with easy to understand information as part of their financial aid package, and that includes these five elements I talked about:\xc2\xa0 First, how much one year of school will cost them.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, financial aid options to pay for this cost with a clear distinction between grants and scholarships, which obviously do not have to be repaid, and loans, which do.\xc2\xa0 The net cost after grants and scholarships are taken into account.\xc2\xa0 Fourth, estimated monthly payments for the federal student loans the student will likely owe once they graduate.\xc2\xa0 And, finally, critically important information about student results, including comparative information about default rates, graduation rates and retention rates for the school.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve worked very, very hard on the access side.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 The goal, however, is not access.\xc2\xa0 The goal is completion and understanding that all these students graduate at the back end.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving this important information provided both clearly and transparently will help students and their parents invest wisely and make the best, most informed decision possible about where to enroll.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the fundamental point here.\xc2\xa0 And today, we\'re calling on all colleges -- all 6,000 colleges, university presidents -- from across the country to make the same commitment as those 10 leaders did today to provide this easy to understand financial data about their higher education investment.</p>\n<p>\n\tDirector Cordray and all the folks on his team at CFPB have been just amazing partners in this effort.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank them for their leadership and their commitment as we take on this critically important work.\xc2\xa0 And now, I\'d like to turn it over to Rich to talk about what the CFPB is doing to help parents, students and consumers know before they owe.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CORDRAY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Arne.\xc2\xa0 Higher education is a critical part of the American Dream, as all of you know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure it\'s been true in your lives.\xc2\xa0 But for many students today, this dream can only be realized through borrowing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFiguring out how to pay for college can be daunting.\xc2\xa0 It\'s often the first major financial decision that a student will make, one that will affect her for the rest of her life.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, for many families, the process is often complex and confusing.\xc2\xa0 It\'s hard for students to compare college costs, evaluate financial aid options and figure out how much debt they can afford.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have heard from thousands of student loan borrowers who tell us that they simply didn\'t understand what they were signing up for.\xc2\xa0 Many of them chose private loans before exhausting their federal loan options, which are cheaper and protect them if they run into trouble.\xc2\xa0 Some resorted to credit cards and other high-priced loans.\xc2\xa0 And, all too often, borrowers got in way over their heads.</p>\n<p>\n\tRecently, we announced that outstanding student loan debt had crossed the $1 trillion mark.\xc2\xa0 Student loans have eclipsed credit cards as the leading source of U.S. household debt outside of mortgages.\xc2\xa0 The stakes have never been higher for families to clearly understand the costs and risks of student debt.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still recovering from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile a college education can be a gateway to better job prospects, taking on too much student debt can have real consequences.\xc2\xa0 Students need to know before they owe.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Consumer Bureau\'s goal across consumer markets is to give people the confidence and peace of mind that the financial world is not full of tricks and traps that will ruin their lives.\xc2\xa0 We want information to be clear and easy to understand, so that consumers can make wise financial decisions for themselves and their families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is an important step toward that goal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re grateful to Secretary Duncan for being a strong partner in a Know Before You Owe initiative to develop a financial aid shopping sheet that enables students to clearly see their aid options so they can pick the package that works best for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to receive support today from college presidents representing some of the largest universities and university systems in America who are committed to ensure that their students understand their financial aid and student loans and the cost of college.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe look forward to continue working with them to create a system where students can climb the economic ladder and live their American Dream.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 To either of you -- what can you do to monitor the universities who are going to impose these standards to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re being imposed properly?\xc2\xa0 And also, you talk about encouraging other students to get on board.\xc2\xa0 In addition to kind of asking them to do so today, what will you do in the coming days to try to get more schools on board?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 To be clear, these aren\xe2\x80\x99t standards.\xc2\xa0 This is just transparency.\xc2\xa0 This is just basic data -- how much are your grants, how much are your loans, what are graduation rates, what do you have to repay at the back end.\xc2\xa0 And we just think America\xe2\x80\x99s young people and their families deserve to have really basic information about this huge decision they\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe think there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tremendous appetite out there.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think universities have anything to hide.\xc2\xa0 And we think just providing that transparency will make families -- will enable families to make better decisions.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work really, really hard.\xc2\xa0 Again, great leadership here.\xc2\xa0 These are major, major systems who have already signed on.\xc2\xa0 And our goal is to have 100 percent of universities sign on as we go into the fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan and Jay, could you respond to the Republican criticism on this student loan bill?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the Democrats have not responded to their proposals that this legislation be paid for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I think obviously all of us want to get this thing done and get it done before July 1st.\xc2\xa0 And the President has worked extraordinarily hard and traveled the country.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has worked extraordinarily hard and traveled the country.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve done the same.\xc2\xa0 If the Republicans are getting serious about that, that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic.\xc2\xa0 And we hope, over the next couple weeks, we fully expect Congress to do the right thing and to solve this and solve it in a bipartisan way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean, though, that you\xe2\x80\x99re open to a compromise offsetting the cost of it, or see the --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s my job to negotiate from here, but again, our goal has been to have this fixed -- to have it fixed by July 1st.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s critically important.\xc2\xa0 For so many not just disadvantaged families, but so many middle-class families now are starting to think college is unaffordable -- somehow it\xe2\x80\x99s not for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s for rich folks.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a real problem.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to take this step in the wrong direction.\xc2\xa0 We have to keep those Stafford interest rates low.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to doing that, and absolutely hope and expect the Republicans to work with us in a bipartisan way to get this done -- not to talk about it, but to fix it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, what programs are you saying that will not be on the table to be considered to help fund this --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not right for me to negotiate from here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Congress for the House and Senate to work together and to get this done by the end of the month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for instance, they\xe2\x80\x99re saying things like the nutrition programs and that kind of efforts that the East Wing is doing to help --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re not serious proposals, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not one we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take seriously.\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious proposal, we\xe2\x80\x99ll entertain it seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is for Mr. Cordray mainly, but it may also apply to you, too, Secretary Duncan.\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans are using a lot of the appropriation bills to cut back on spending in some of the areas that constitute what the administration would consider its achievements to date.\xc2\xa0 And, for instance, the ag appropriations bill cuts back deeply on the CFTC.\xc2\xa0 There are cutbacks for the SEC.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what this means, do you think, for enforcement and implementation of the Dodd-Frank law.\xc2\xa0 And if you have anything in terms of the appropriations for your department and Race to the Top or any other program, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CORDRAY:\xc2\xa0 I think obviously if you don\'t have resources, it makes it harder to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 The CFPB is like the other banking agencies where we\xe2\x80\x99re not an appropriated agency, and I think that that\'s appropriate.\xc2\xa0 Those agencies have been taken out of politics for many years, in some cases over a century.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important for us to do our job of protecting the American consumer in the financial marketplace.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a hazardous place; they often end up in trouble -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that.\xc2\xa0 It helped lead in the mortgage market to the financial crisis, and that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working to fix that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give a specific, maybe, of how enforcement would be affected?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CORDRAY:\xc2\xa0 Well, given that the proposals you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about don\'t affect the CFPB, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to give a specific.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just basic common sense that if you don\'t have the resources to enforce the law, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to enforce it effectively.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s part of what\xe2\x80\x99s contemplated here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, is there anything that applies?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at the Ryan budget, you see a couple -- potentially a couple hundred thousand children lose access to Head Start.\xc2\xa0 I would argue that\'s probably the best investment we can make is to get our three- and four-year-olds off to a good start and ready to succeed in kindergarten.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d see potentially hundreds of thousands of people lose access to Pell grants and Pell grants take a step backwards.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve been most proud of that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a 50 percent increase from 6 million to 9 million people, young people with access to Pell grants and going to college.\xc2\xa0 And we need to educate our way to a better economy.\xc2\xa0 And anyone who argues we need less access to college, that that\'s the right thing for children or families or our communities or our nation, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re cutting off our nose to spite our face.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I continue to think passionately that education is an investment not an expense.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked for an investment in the status quo.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen our administration push an unprecedented level of reform at every level -- early childhood, K to 12, and now in the higher ed side.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re proposing a Race to the Top for higher education.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, this is about shared responsibility, so we have to invest at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 But on the higher ed side, which we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today, this past year, 40 states cut funding for higher ed -- 40 states, 80 percent of the country.\xc2\xa0 How is that good for where we need to go?</p>\n<p>\n\tI know these are really tough economic times, but we want to use a Race to the Top for higher education to incentivize states to invest and make sure more young people have access, not less.\xc2\xa0 So we have to get there.\xc2\xa0 And the jobs of the future are going to go to the countries where they have the knowledge workers -- and that\'s either going to be here, or that\'s going to be overseas.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s up to us.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in our control.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are tuitions skyrocketing so much?\xc2\xa0 And what has become of the administration -- previous proposals by the administration to try to clamp down on this by threatening to withhold federal funds if tuitions keep rising?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the biggest driver of increased tuition -- there are states cutting back on funding for it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the biggest driver.\xc2\xa0 And so, where states continue to invest, where we can challenge that, then we can continue to challenge universities to be efficient and to be more effective and to be more productive and use technology.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut our goal for Race to the Top for higher education is threefold.\xc2\xa0 One is to incentivize states to continue to invest.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, is incentivize universities to keep tuition down.\xc2\xa0 And many places are doing very creative things in tough economic times -- not everybody, but a lot.\xc2\xa0 And then, finally -- I keep saying this -- it can\'t just be about access, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be about completion.\xc2\xa0 So where universities are building cultures around completion where first-generation college-goers and English-language learners and Pell grant recipients are graduating, we want to use Race to the Top resources to incentivize that behavior.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be about shared responsibility.\xc2\xa0 We have to play.\xc2\xa0 States have to play.\xc2\xa0 Universities have to play.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 When you talked about some of the creative solutions, are you referring to the program recently profiled in Ohio where they\'re selling off this lease to all of the parking, and privatizing the airport and --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that one specifically.\xc2\xa0 We see universities who are going to three-year programs, going to no-frills campuses.\xc2\xa0 You see universities doing very different things.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually really interesting.\xc2\xa0 All those introductory classes that often wash out half the students -- half the students fail -- they\'re actually doing some really creative things with technology of driving down costs and increasing passing rates pretty substantially.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of work that universities are doing in a creative way to control costs and to make sure students are staying in there.\xc2\xa0 We have to take those best practices to scale.\xc2\xa0 We have to make that the norm rather than the exception.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the Secretary, along with the accurate sticker price initiative, has there been any commitment by these university leaders to control their costs, keep their costs down?\xc2\xa0 Because I would imagine that there\xe2\x80\x99s maybe an incentive to not participate in something like this, so you can maybe hoodwink students into paying a little bit more.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So I think if folks are out there trying to hoodwink students, we have the bully pulpit.\xc2\xa0 And where folks are doing that, we intend to be very loud and very clear.\xc2\xa0 And again, we have 6,000 institutions of higher education.\xc2\xa0 We have the best system in the world.\xc2\xa0 What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had is enough transparency.\xc2\xa0 I think transparency is a very, very powerful lever.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s why this partnership is so important.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our young people are smart and savvy.\xc2\xa0 And if some university thinks they\'re going to get over or get by, by hoodwinking people, I think that\'s a losing strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a commitment from these universities to control their costs as part of this plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Many of them are doing that in a creative way.\xc2\xa0 People in very different situations -- in some states we have -- Maryland has done a pretty good job of funding education.\xc2\xa0 California is very -- has struggled.\xc2\xa0 So not every institution is at a similar platform, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to hold everyone to the same standard.\xc2\xa0 But asking everyone to become more efficient, to become more economical, you had some real leaders there who are doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, what we want is, with transparency, good actors are going to get rewarded, people are going to vote with their feet.\xc2\xa0 Bad actors are going to lose business, and we think that\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 We think that marketplace needs to play in ways that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t before.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell, House Republican leaders are really complaining that they\xe2\x80\x99ve offered up four different ways now to pay for the student loan fix, all of which they say are in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, are things the President himself has proposed.\xc2\xa0 They can\'t get a response back from the White House.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that they should expect this week?\xc2\xa0 And how long is it going to take for the White House to sort of figure out where they\'re --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s our collective goal to have this done by July 1st, whatever that\'s -- three weeks, three and a half weeks, whatever it is.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re glad folks are taking this very seriously now, and we hope and anticipate moving forward in a bipartisan way by the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I feel the real sense of urgency now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to be negotiating with them, or is the White House going to be negotiating with them?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is -- Congress has to do this together, so we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to help, happy to participate.\xc2\xa0 But we need Republicans and Democrats to come together.\xc2\xa0 And if they can come together on nothing else, I think they can come together on education and do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 So we fully anticipate and expect this to be resolved in a good way and this problem to be fixed for the 7.4 million Americans this would impact if it doesn\'t get fixed.\xc2\xa0 We anticipate by the end of the month having a good resolution here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 proposals is to raise the federal employee retirement contribution.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you would propose?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this economic climate --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it would be --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for me to get into any specifics here.\xc2\xa0 Again, the goal is to get this done in a bipartisan way that makes sense over the next three, three and a half weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Senator McConnell, though, said today that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any outreach from the White House on this.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 Has there been --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know all the details.\xc2\xa0 I have a lot of respect for Senator McConnell, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s very serious about this, we want to sit down with him and Speaker Boehner and everybody else who want to get this done, and get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This concerns the CFPB\xe2\x80\x99s role with higher education, and it seems to be with regards to student loans.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans have said -- Senate Republicans have complained in the past already that the agency sort of has too broad and too vague power.\xc2\xa0 The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s involved in college cost, does that speak to that at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CORDRAY:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything broad or vague about our powers.\xc2\xa0 These are very specific problems that regular families face across this country -- problems in the mortgage markets; problems with credit card debt; increasingly, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and discussed today, problems with student loan debt -- knowing what the prices and risks are before they make decisions so they can make better-informed decisions.\xc2\xa0 And as Secretary Duncan said, those are decisions that will make the market work better.</p>\n<p>\n\tEverybody who supports a free market should want consumers to be well informed, able to compare, able to make choices.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working for across all of these markets.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the American people support, and I think it\'s something that they deserve.\xc2\xa0 And I think they have a right to expect basic consumer protections on all of these products that are so important to their lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Goyal.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll take this last one for these gentlemen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, the Obama-Singh Knowledge Initiative was signed between the world\'s largest and richest democracies by President Obama and Prime Minister Dr. Singh.\xc2\xa0 Now, high-level officials are meeting next week at the third annual U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 Now, what role your agency will play as far as this Knowledge Initiative is concerned between the U.S. and India?\xc2\xa0 And many universities are going to open in India, like the U.S. universities and colleges.\xc2\xa0 So what is your role, sir?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve had -- you and I have talked about it before.\xc2\xa0 We have a great working relationship with my counterpart in India.\xc2\xa0 He is a man, I think, of tremendous vision and courage.\xc2\xa0 We have real challenges here.\xc2\xa0 I think the challenges India faces dwarf -- make ours look relatively simple.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\'s a chance to provide a much better education for hundreds and hundreds and thousands of young people in India.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd whatever we can do to help as they build the next system of community colleges, as they scale up what\xe2\x80\x99s working, as American institutions start to set up campuses in India, we want to be a great partner.\xc2\xa0 I just absolutely believe that a rising tide lifts all boats.\xc2\xa0 And the more young people across India are getting a world-class education, that\'s a great thing for your country and for ours as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just, do you believe and do you feel so next week that there will be some major kind of initiative or you will be announcing something major?\xc2\xa0 How many universities --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I hope we can come back on that next week.\xc2\xa0 It\'s premature now.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Secretary Duncan and Director Cordray.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain to take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Let everybody get out the door while I survey the field, clear my throat and look to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm the death of al Qaeda number two, al-Libi in the U.S. drone strike in Pakistan, and comment please on what his assassination would mean for the al Qaeda organization, your fight against it and, secondly, for U.S. relations with Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that our intelligence community has intelligence that leads them to believe that al Qaeda\'s number-two leader, al-Libi, is dead.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t get into details about how his death was brought about.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that he served as al Qaeda\'s general manager, responsible for overseeing the group\'s day-to-day operations in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and he managed outreach to al Qaeda\'s regional affiliates.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis death is part of the degradation that has been taking place to core al Qaeda during the past several years.\xc2\xa0 And that degradation has depleted the ranks to such an extent that there is now no clear successor to take on the breadth of his responsibilities, and that puts additional pressure on al Qaeda\'s post-bin Laden leader, Zawahiri, to try to manage the group in an effective way.\xc2\xa0 This would be a major blow -- we believe al-Libi\'s death is a major blow to core al Qaeda, removing the number-two leader for the second time in less than a year and further damaging the group\'s morale and cohesion, and bringing it closer to its ultimate demise than ever before.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on the Pakistan question -- if this was a U.S. drone strike it would be the second U.S. attack that killed a senior al Qaeda leader within Pakistan\'s borders in a very short period of time, and they didn\'t respond so well to the first one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that our government has been able to confirm al-Libi\'s death.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on the circumstances of his death or the location.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that he was the number-two leader in al Qaeda, and this is the second time in less than a year that the number-two leader of al Qaeda has been removed from the battlefield.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that represents, in the wake of the death of Osama bin Laden, another serious blow to core al Qaeda in what is an ongoing effort to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat a foe that brought great terror and death to the United States on September 11th, 2001, and that has perpetrated acts of terrorism against innocent civilians around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that his breadth of experience would be difficult to replace, but the organization has shown that it can get a warm body wherever it needs to and continually regenerate.\xc2\xa0 What is it about him that makes him -- made him particularly valuable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he was very much an operational leader, general manager, of al Qaeda with a range of experience that is hard to replicate.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is a job that is hard to fill and that there may not be, given the duration of late that people have held that job, that there could be a lot of candidates hoping to fill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is that removing leaders like al-Libi from the very top of al Qaeda is part of an ongoing effort to disrupt and dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And that is an important piece of business.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, with the crisis in Europe deepening by the day, can you talk about what the President has been doing behind the scenes in the last few days and what his conversations with European leaders have intended to send a message on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Throughout this crisis in the eurozone, the President has remained closely engaged with his European counterparts, as I have said in the past.\xc2\xa0 And that has continued throughout recent days and weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe that economic performance in Europe is of great importance to us here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The eurozone crisis creates a headwind for the global economy, and we are obviously connected to the global economy, so trouble in the eurozone presents a challenge to the American economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEurope is our -- is an important trading partner, and our financial systems, as you know, are deeply connected.\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve said in the past, European leaders have taken significant steps in implementing a firewall, establishing a firewall, and in various countries implementing reforms that are necessary.\xc2\xa0 And we support those efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore needs to be done, as we have said.\xc2\xa0 And today, as you know, I believe, the G7 ministers and governors reviewed developments in the global economy and financial markets, and the policy response currently under consideration, including progress towards financial and fiscal union in Europe.\xc2\xa0 They agreed to monitor developments closely, ahead of the G20 Summit in Los Cabos.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can say that European leaders seem to be moving with a heightened sense of urgency, and we welcome that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to see accelerated European action over the next several weeks, including in the run-up to the aforementioned G20 leaders meeting in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 A movement to strengthen the European banking system will be of particular importance in this time period.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has tried to walk a fine line over the last several months between not appearing to lecture his European counterparts but also trying to prod them into action -- he\xe2\x80\x99s felt that strong action was needed.\xc2\xa0 Is it time now to step up that message?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that he needs to underscore that even more strongly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President and Secretary Geithner and others have shared the United States\xe2\x80\x99 experience with the kinds of challenges that the Europeans have been facing, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the need to implement very strict stress tests on banks, the need to ensure that financial institutions are recapitalized.\xc2\xa0 These are decisions that are sometimes difficult politically, but important for the long-term fiscal health of -- in the case of the decisions we made here, of the United States, and in the case of the decisions being made in Europe, of the countries of the eurozone and the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has discussed, as you know, and he talked about at Camp David, he has discussed with European leaders the efforts that we have taken here in Washington to restart our economy, to reverse the extreme economic decline that was taking place here in 2008 and 2009, and to put the economy on a path towards economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That focus on growth and job creation is very important in the near term.\xc2\xa0 And as you saw coming out of the G8, there was a commitment by and a consensus from European leaders there to focus on growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is much work to be done in Europe, and we -- this administration, the President, Secretary Geithner and others continue to advise and consult their European counterparts as they make some very important decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did your intelligence sources provide information about whether or not there were any other people killed other than al-Libi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you except for the confirmation that they have that al-Libi is dead.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I would refer you to other agencies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult to foresee a world in which the United States is not the only country with this kind of technology.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration at all concerned about the precedent being set in terms of secrecy, in terms of operating military craft in other sovereign nations, and what we might see as a result when China or Russia get their hands on drones?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss methods from here, and I do not -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t discuss --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asking you to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is in relation, obviously, to the particular incident that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into details about al-Libi\xe2\x80\x99s death, the circumstances or the location.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would simply say that this President is firmly committed to carrying out his policy objective in Afghanistan and in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, which is to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to disrupting, dismantling and ultimately defeating al Qaeda beyond that region, too.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we cooperate with countries around the world in efforts to counter al Qaeda and other extremists.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not relating this question to the death of al-Libi -- the United States has this technology; President Obama has said that the administration should be more transparent about it.\xc2\xa0 Is there not any concern that the administration has that there is precedent being set?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve just heard Assad this week blame the massacre that took place in Houla on terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Any country can say that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I heard a collective rolling of the<br/>\n\teyes --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- or saw a collective rolling of the eyes around the globe because everyone knows how preposterous that assertion is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s my point.\xc2\xa0 And countries claim terrorism as a justification for their actions all the time.\xc2\xa0 Even positing that the United States, under any President, only acts righteously every time, is there not any concern that a precedent is being set either for some future dangerous President and for any other --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, without getting into very sensitive issues that go to the core of our national security interests, I can simply say that this President, this Commander-in-Chief, puts a great deal of thought and care into the prosecution of and implementation of the policy decisions he makes, and that includes in the effort to combat al Qaeda in the Af-Pak region and around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no question, as the President has stated on many occasions, that the decisions that a Commander-in-Chief has to make when it comes to war and peace, when it comes to defending the United States and protecting the United States and our allies are weighty serious decisions, and he treats them that way every time he makes one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What gives the United States the moral foundation to object in the future to when Russia -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how many questions -- I mean, maybe you should have like an interview with him somewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you mind if I continue?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go right ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what the -- where the moral foundation comes from if the United States objects in the future to an action being taken by China or Russia along these same lines.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I reject the comparison, but I would simply say that, as I said just now, that this President, this administration takes very seriously the decisions that are involved in the effort to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But this President is absolutely committed to that objective.\xc2\xa0 As Commander-in-Chief, as President, protection of the United States, protection of American citizens, protection of our allies and our interests are a high priority -- the highest.\xc2\xa0 And that will be the case as long as he\xe2\x80\x99s in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has the killing of al-Libi complicated efforts to press Pakistan to open its supply routes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Kristen, as I think I just noted, I can only discuss the fact that we have confirmation of his death.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t get into location or circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say that we have an important relationship with Pakistan that we endeavor to work on every day because it is in our national security interest to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To ask it in another way -- obviously this was a big topic of conversation during the NATO Summit -- has the administration made progress since NATO toward getting Pakistan to reopen the routes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you on that.\xc2\xa0 Both, obviously this administration and the government of Pakistan are committed to resolving that issue.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it will be resolved, but I have no specific updates for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are talks ongoing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have specific information about discussions on that issue.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have regular contacts and consultations with the Pakistanis.</p>\n<p>\n\tMove around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as you know, yesterday was third-year anniversary of speech that the President gave in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 In that speech he made some promises concerning Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, the Middle East peace process, of course, about changing the American image in the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 Now three years later, do you think that the President has kept these promises?\xc2\xa0 And how does this administration read or see his speech after bearing in mind the events of Arab Spring?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say again without going through in detail the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, that, yes, the President has kept the commitments that he made there.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been, I think, very transparent and clear about what his objectives are, about what the interests of the United States are, who our foes are and who they are not.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe, as I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen throughout the Arab Spring, has very carefully made clear the United States sides with the democratic desires and aspirations of the people of the region.\xc2\xa0 And while each country is different, and the process by which each country engages in a democratic transformation has been and will be different, our commitment to that democratic future is strong and will continue to be so.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has also committed, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been discussing with Jake, to making sure that our military operations in a place like Afghanistan have a very clear objective.\xc2\xa0 When he took office in January of 2009, you could ask 10 members of the United States military -- or the previous administration what our objective in Afghanistan was and you would get 10 different answers because it was so unclear.\xc2\xa0 And that was highly unacceptable to President Obama, and he made sure that he thoroughly reviewed the situation in Afghanistan, thoroughly reviewed our policy objectives, our resources, and put in place a policy with a very specific goal and the resources necessary to fulfill it.\xc2\xa0 And I think that has contributed to a clarity about U.S. interests and U.S. objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the economy, former President Clinton last night at one of the fundraisers said that if you look at history, an economic recovery takes five to 10 years, and if there was a housing collapse --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 After a financial crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Did I not say that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You said an economic recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but after a --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction between the types of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After a downturn, it takes five to 10 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more specific than just a downturn.\xc2\xa0 Some shallow recessions take less time to recover from.\xc2\xa0 When you suffer from a financial crisis that precipitates the worst recession since the Great Depression, the hole is quite deep.\xc2\xa0 I think there are important distinctions to be made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And another distinction he made was that when there\xe2\x80\x99s a housing collapse, as there was in this case, it usually takes longer and can take up to 10 years to turn it around.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- do you agree with that timetable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President has made clear -- President Obama has made clear from the very beginning that we did not get into the mess that was the Great Recession, the worst recession since the Great Depression, overnight.\xc2\xa0 It took a number of years of flawed policy decisions, of an absence of appropriate oversight and regulation, of unfortunate risky behavior in our financial markets to precipitate the economic free fall that we all experienced in 2008 and 2009.\xc2\xa0 And it will take a long time for us to get out of the hole that that created.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat he has also said is that working with Congress and other folks, he has presided over a situation where that severe economic decline was halted and reversed; a situation where almost 9 percent shrinkage in our GDP has now turned around to the point where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen two and a half years of economic growth, positive GDP; a situation where we were losing 750,000 jobs per month, to now a situation where even though growth in jobs has not been satisfying, has not been enough, it has created 4.3 million private sector jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have more work to do.\xc2\xa0 There is no question.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what President Clinton was speaking to and certainly what President Obama talks about all the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so it may take up to 10 years?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not an economist, and I think we all believe that we need to do everything we can to bring about the day when the 8 million jobs that were lost as a result of that recession are recovered, and that we are in a situation where not only are we back to where we were before, but we are stronger economically.\xc2\xa0 We have a foundation economically upon which to build in the 21st century that doesn\'t rely on financial bubbles or housing bubbles or .com bubbles, but relies on strength in our manufacturing sector, strength in education, strength in innovation and strength throughout the country economically.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton also said, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember me, I\xe2\x80\x99m the only guy that gave you four surplus budgets out of the eight I sent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is it awkward for President Obama to hear President Clinton say that when he has not had surpluses?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, that is a profoundly interesting question that you would phrase -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The point that President Clinton was making, and I concede that he makes it well, but I will attempt on my own to make it, is that when he was in office, he inherited a deficit.\xc2\xa0 After eight years in office, he presided over a number of years of surpluses and turned over to his successor an economic circumstance, which was judged by the CBO and everyone else, to be one that would produce surpluses as \xe2\x80\x9cfar as the eye could see.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Eight years later, when President Obama took office, handed the Oval Office by his predecessor, a Republican President, we had the largest deficits in history up to that time.\xc2\xa0 Something happened in those eight years, and it was not fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And that is unfortunate.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had a situation in eight years where record surpluses were turned into record deficits.\xc2\xa0 So claims by those who supported the policies that led to record deficits that they are the bastions of fiscal conservatism do not meet the laugh test.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not borne out by the facts.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need to work together.\xc2\xa0 This is not about one side being better than the other, and I think that\'s -- is it important to bring it back to this.\xc2\xa0 What was a fact under President Clinton is that he had contentious relations with a Republican Congress, but in the end, he had Republicans in Congress who were willing to work with him to help bring about those surpluses -- albeit in economic times that were not nearly as strained as we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced in the last few years -- but still, it takes bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, we have not seen enough of that in the last several years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut hope springs eternal and this President is committed to putting forward the kinds of proposals that address the weak spots in our economy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look at where we still have weaknesses in our economy -- in construction, in state and local employment, especially in education.\xc2\xa0 These are areas where the President has put forward specific proposals that would boost employment and boost economic growth; the kinds of proposals that should, I think, earn bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe American Jobs Act, a portion of which was passed by this Congress -- the extension of the payroll tax cut and the extension of unemployment insurance -- had within it elements that Republicans in Congress refused to vote for, that outside economists said at the time would create more than a million jobs.\xc2\xa0 So Republicans in Congress left a million jobs on the table, unfortunately, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to ask oil and gas companies to give up subsidies despite record profits.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to ask others to give up tax breaks and loopholes that would have allowed for the funding of those initiatives that would have taken those million jobs off the table and put teachers back into the classroom and construction workers back on the job.\xc2\xa0 The employment picture would look a little different today had they chosen otherwise.\xc2\xa0 And those proposals remain on the table and available for action.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you mentioned unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to the millions of people who have been unemployed for six months or longer about their worries that unemployment insurance will trigger off?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to fight to extend that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President fought very hard and faced quite remarkable resistance to extending unemployment insurance in December and again in February, I believe it was.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we need to take a number of steps to strengthen the economy and create an environment where more jobs are being created by the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that is what\xe2\x80\x99s needed right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific for you on new proposals or along the lines that you suggest.\xc2\xa0 But this is not calculus, it\'s just math.\xc2\xa0 We know what we can do to improve the employment picture and improve the growth picture.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been studying these issues quite a bit -- and you have, too -- for a number of months and years now.\xc2\xa0 And action can and should be taken so that the American people feel that Washington is addressing their highest priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 If the President were, by some miracle, to succeed in getting some of these initiatives through, is he concerned that adding to the deficit would bring the debt ceiling closer, not push it farther out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re aware that of course the American Jobs Act was paid for entirely.\xc2\xa0 Again, there\'s -- but you have to make choices.\xc2\xa0 And that was the debate we had and that\'s the debate we\'re continuing to have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'re right.\xc2\xa0 If you don\'t want to ask oil and gas companies to give up their subsidies, you don\'t want to ask corporate jet owners to give up their subsidies, if you don\'t want to ask the wealthiest Americans who have enjoyed a pretty good run in the past 10 years or so to pay a little bit more, then it\'s harder to pay for these initiatives that would put, in the case of the remaining elements of the American Jobs Act, more than a million people to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that\'s what governing is all about.\xc2\xa0 You got to make these choices.\xc2\xa0 The President is clear about the choice he thinks ought to be made.\xc2\xa0 Overwhelmingly, the American people tend to support those initiatives.\xc2\xa0 And, hopefully, Congress will act.\xc2\xa0 There\'s pressure on them, too, to demonstrate to their constituents that they\'re not just sitting on their hands and hoping the economy doesn\'t get better because it will improve their prospects in November.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, I don\'t think their constituents think that\'s generally a responsible approach.\xc2\xa0 So, hopefully, there will be pressure on them to do something and to demonstrate they did something to help the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeslie, and then Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you just discuss the CBO report that was out today that has some pretty grim numbers?\xc2\xa0 Republicans are seizing on it, suggesting that it\'s proof that the President is not taking the country on the right path.\xc2\xa0 And what is he going to do with his negotiations later this year?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think what the CBO report demonstrates is that we need to take sensible measures to deal with our medium- and long-term deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this is arithmetic, not calculus.\xc2\xa0 We know what we have to do.\xc2\xa0 There has been a great deal of ink spilled on the various options available to us.\xc2\xa0 There is either an option that says dealing with our deficits and debt, the responsibility for that should be borne entirely almost by the middle class and seniors and folks who depend on programs like Medicaid, or it should be borne evenly in a balanced way, which is what the President believes.\xc2\xa0 That approach has been endorsed not just by this administration, not just by Democrats in Congress, but by every bipartisan commission of any credibility that\'s looked at this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe holdouts, thus far, have been elected members of the Republican Party in Congress -- not all of them, but most of them.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, that will change, too.\xc2\xa0 There are occasionally glimmers of hope on the horizon with regards to recognition of the need to take a balanced approach to our deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, this is a responsibility that everyone needs to take and to bear, dealing with our deficit and debt -- and going back to my answer to Ed\'s question about the fact that this President, in the midst of a cataclysmic economic decline, was also, in addition to the keys of the building, handed the largest deficit thus far in history.\xc2\xa0 Plus, the need to take dramatic steps to prevent a depression, dramatic steps that were seen almost across the board as including the need for a program like the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he also took steps like saving the automobile industry that was not popular at the time, but has gained more and more adherence in retrospect as every week passes, because it\'s been the right thing to do so obviously when we see the numbers coming out of Detroit.\xc2\xa0 These are tough calls and tough decisions.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no question that they created a situation where we need to take action on our deficit and debt, and we need to do it in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to return to the eurozone crisis affecting the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe June is the month that European leaders have to get something done?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard him give a date or a month.\xc2\xa0 I think, as I just said when discussing this earlier, we have noted that European leaders, European officials, seem to be acting with a sense of urgency.\xc2\xa0 And we anticipate and hope that there will be expedited action in the weeks ahead, in the run-up to the G20.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a deadline to provide to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think Europeans are fully aware of the situation that they find themselves in.\xc2\xa0 And they understand that, I think, as you would expect, what the options are and what steps are available to them that would help stabilize the situation, stabilize the banking sector, and help them emerge from this crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department said today that finance ministers from the G7 countries, along with the Central Bank, the President is having an emergency conference call.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the emergency conference call about?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mentioned that when I was answering questions on Europe, that today, the G7 ministers and governors did meet via teleconference and reviewed developments in the global economy and financial markets, and the policy response under consideration, including the progress towards financial and fiscal union in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think there\'s no mystery to the fact that, as I have said, that there\'s a need to act with some urgency.\xc2\xa0 Europeans have it very much within their capacity to deal with this situation.\xc2\xa0 And we have provided consistent advice and counsel based on our experience on how to deal with this, and we\'ll continue to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How worried is the President about the crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he is very clear that he recognizes, as I said earlier, that Europe is a very important trading partner to the United States, and troubles in the European economies have an impact on the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Because of that relationship, our financial systems are very integrated and trouble in the European financial sector can have an impact on the American economy.\xc2\xa0 This is the headwind that the President has talked about in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to take the steps that we can take, that we can control entirely here in Washington to insulate the American economy, to insulate the American people from these kinds of challenges posed by Europe and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned he was closely engaged.\xc2\xa0 If he was talking with other world leaders and Presidents, you would read out those calls, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I think you might expect that he has conversations that we don\xe2\x80\x99t always tell you about.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be sly here.\xc2\xa0 I would just say it certainly is the case and has been the case as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been Press Secretary that the President has conversations that we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out to you either with American business leaders or members of Congress or foreign leaders or others.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every conversation the President has.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what are your expectations for the upcoming \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d -- the next phase of that \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of a concerted effort to unify the international community around the notion that there needs to be a political transition in Syria to help the opposition in Syria to organize itself and to bring diplomatic pressure to bear on the Assad regime as well as pressure through sanctions and other means to help facilitate that transition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that includes -- and Secretary of State Clinton has been very clear about this as have others -- that includes working with other members of the United Nations Security Council, in particular Russia, on the need to take steps to bring about political transition in Syria, take steps to prevent Assad from continuing to brutally assault his own people -- because there is not a whole lot of time available to the international community before that situation, at least potentially, devolves into a sectarian civil war, a situation that could spill beyond the Syrian borders and could involve other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that obviously is profoundly not in the interest of the Syrian people, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interest of countries of the region.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interest of any member of the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to work collectively to ensure that that does not transpire.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you ready to say this is the last such meeting before it devolves into that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to draw any lines in the sand.\xc2\xa0 I simply will make the point that there is a need to act urgently because the situation in Syria demands it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President monitoring the recall election in Wisconsin?\xc2\xa0 And if Governor Walker isn\xe2\x80\x99t recalled, what do you think that says about the mood of the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President -- I know the President is aware of the recall election.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s got some other responsibilities, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s not following it minute by minute, but he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it.\xc2\xa0 You know that he tweeted about it earlier and stands with the Democratic candidate, Mayor Barrett, in this race.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would simply say -- not speaking for him, because I haven\'t had this conversation with him -- but noting what others have noted in your profession and elsewhere, that a race where one side is outspending the other by a ratio of at least 8 to 1 probably won\'t tell us much about a future race.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it looks like the highway bill conference is about to collapse.\xc2\xa0 Is the President prepared to make calls, invite members of Congress in?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously both Republicans and Democrats want to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is prepared to make the case that we need to take action on the surface transportation bill, on investments in infrastructure, precisely because this is an area that has been identified, rightly, as a soft spot in our economy; an area where we can take steps to help improve economic growth and job creation, the construction industry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t have a specific action plan to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But it really is vital that Congress get its act together and pass some of these important pieces of legislation that have -- in the case of surface transportation and in the case of the aforementioned student loan rate legislation and a host of others -- have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 And there is no reason why they should not enjoy that bipartisan support today and in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we can expect him to get personal --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have an action plan to provide to you, but it is essential that Congress do its job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday -- or last night, President Clinton said that the GOP and Mitt Romney had adopted Europe\'s policies.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President -- excuse me, President Obama agrees with that statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t had that conversation with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 I think others have made the observation that austerity alone is not -- at least not the right prescription for and was not the right prescription for our economy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not in a position and do not want to lecture other nations about the steps they should take.\xc2\xa0 We can provide counsel and advice based on our experience.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we are certainly not satisfied with the pace of the recovery thus far, the pace of job creation thus far.\xc2\xa0 But there has been economic growth and there has been significant job creation -- 4.3 million jobs in the last 27 months here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that is in no small measure.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it is completely because of the initiatives that were taken to help stop the bleeding, in terms of the cataclysmic economic decline that greeted this President when he took office, and reverse it and to create a situation where the economy began to grow again, where employers began to hire again, and in some sectors of the economy like manufacturing and the auto industry, where the economy really began to rebound in significant ways.\xc2\xa0 It has been uneven and it is far from complete, but it is a picture of a response to a financial and economic crisis that I think bears review.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, on the student loan issue, Secretary Duncan said just moments ago that he didn\'t want to negotiate from the lectern, but that if Republicans offered serious proposals, the White House would engage those serious proposals.\xc2\xa0 Just generally speaking, the Republicans have offered proposals.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe they\'re serious?\xc2\xa0 And if so, are you willing to engage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to negotiate the particulars here.\xc2\xa0 I would note -- look, I share Secretary Duncan\'s optimism about the fact that this will be resolved.\xc2\xa0 Despite the Speaker referring to it as a phony issue, we think there are signs that Republicans understand that it would be a terrible thing for the 7.4 million Americans who would be affected if these loan rates were allowed to double.\xc2\xa0 And, therefore, they will take the necessary action.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the nitty-gritty here of negotiating --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the next step for the White House involvement in this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll continue to work with Congress and with the leaders on this issue to get it resolved.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have specific elements of what that final outcome will look like for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tAri.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House has said for several years -- a few years, at least -- that the health care law cannot stand without the individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 Is that still your position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that, obviously, the individual mandate is a hugely important component to the Affordable Care Act, because it is what allows for, in many ways, coverage of those with preexisting conditions and others who might otherwise not be able to get insurance were the mandate not in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it is profoundly important, as it was, say, in Massachusetts and has been in its implementation in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that\'s why Republicans in Massachusetts, and even at the Heritage Foundation, thought it was a good idea when they came up with it.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to game out for you what -- I know where you\'re headed -- what a Supreme Court decision would look like if it were to come out this way or that way.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, I believe, I think a lot of lawyers believe, who have studied the precedent here with regards to the Commerce Clause, that the Affordable Care Act is very much constitutional.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s up to the Supreme Court to render its judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you still believe that functionally, as a matter of policy, the law --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no change in what my predecessor or others have said about that.\xc2\xa0 But, again, the question is based on an assumption about a decision that the Supreme Court has not made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, earlier you said that the servicemembers who were in Afghanistan -- the conflict there is simpler because of the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 Do drone strikes make it less simple to the American people to understand, when these are secret and often done without really understanding --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re trying to get me to talk about things that I can\'t talk about from the podium.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I will simply say that the American people very much support the idea that our efforts in Afghanistan, efforts that put the lives of American men and women in uniform at risk -- as well as the lives of our civilian personnel in Afghanistan at risk -- should be focused primarily on disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 That is the policy objective that the President put into place and it\'s the right one.\xc2\xa0 And it is the reason why we went to Afghanistan in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they support it if it\'s secret?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\'re conflating a bunch of things here that I would love to tease them apart for you, and I\'m happy to do that at another time.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President\'s policy objective of defeating al Qaeda is one that does have the support of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the transit of Venus, is the President expecting to spend any time today looking at the transit of Venus?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He is a nerdy guy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s cloudy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My colleague says it\xe2\x80\x99s clouding up out there.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\'t even aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m so focused on making sure I have the answers to your questions, I knew nothing about the transit of Venus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay, last one.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 That was it.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 My audience is leaving.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:42 P.M.
