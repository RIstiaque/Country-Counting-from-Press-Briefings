EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CHANG:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming on the call on relatively short notice.\xc2\xa0 This is a big day for us.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President will be addressing the Millennium Development Goals Summit during which he will have some very important remarks to say about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s development policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the line with us are Mike Froman, deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs, and Gayle Smith, special assistant to the President and senior director for international development.\xc2\xa0 They will be speaking on the record, and after some opening remarks we will turn this over to questions.\xc2\xa0 And without further ado, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to turn it over to Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, Ben, and thanks, everybody, for joining us.\xc2\xa0 As Ben said, the President in his speech before the MDG Summit will lay out the administration\xe2\x80\x99s new development policy and we wanted to spend a few minutes walking you through the major elements of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, this is the first development policy issued by a U.S. President.\xc2\xa0 And so it is an important statement of not just what the administration intends to do with regard to foreign assistance, but the broader development policy agenda including how other policy tools are brought to bear on development overall.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the product of an almost year-long effort involving 16 agencies who touch development in various ways.\xc2\xa0 And it reflects also the national security strategy that the administration issued earlier this year, which made it clear that development is a strategic, economic and moral imperative for the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt recognizes that there\xe2\x80\x99s been enormous progress made in reducing global poverty, but a lot more still to do.\xc2\xa0 And it has several key elements.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne, a focus on economic growth, that the goal of this policy is to see to the emerging markets of the future and make it possible for countries to eventually graduate from assistance; that is, a focus, as I mentioned, on development, not just foreign aid.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a focus on selectivity.\xc2\xa0 Rather than trying to do everything everywhere well, we will focus on those countries or sub-regions where they have the governance necessary and the conditions in place to succeed, and also on those sectors where we have a comparative advantage.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs part of that, it requires a forged division of labor between ourselves and other donors -- both other governments but also international organizations, foundations, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector -- so that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be putting an emphasis on coordinating with other donors as we pursue this strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great emphasis on innovation and investing in game-changing technologies such as in agriculture, health, and clean energy, building on a long tradition of such investments such as the Green Revolution.\xc2\xa0 And very much an emphasis on sustainability, not just providing food aid or medicines in emergency situation -- although we will continue to do that, obviously -- but investing also in health systems and agricultural productivity so that countries can better serve their own people.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, it is a policy that elevates the role of development, makes sure that development has a seat at the table at the White House and the National Security Council when their issues -- when those issues are relevant.\xc2\xa0 It emphasizes the rebuilding of USAID and building out its capabilities in areas like budget and planning, attracting the best quality people to go into development to come to USAID; and also emphasizes the coordination both between AID and the State Department, but also among all 16 agencies that are involved in development.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really the first time there is a development policy that will inform the efforts of the entire government, not just one or two pieces of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I turn it over to Gayle, who ran the interagency process that produced this policy directive, for any further comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mike, and thank you all very much for joining.\xc2\xa0 I think a couple things in terms of the kind of larger frame for this.\xc2\xa0 The President will make the point that development is in our strategic, economic and moral interest.\xc2\xa0 And I think as you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in our national security strategy.\xc2\xa0 Part of that is about really moving the development ball forward.\xc2\xa0 In other words, we can do a lot to ameliorate the conditions of poverty, but I think what he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to and what this policy speaks to is the need for us to really invest in meaningful change.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd just to underscore a couple of the points that Mike made, I think this means we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a deliberate policy that will guide all agencies.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s very new that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case 15, 20 years ago is that there are many more agencies engaged internationally than there used to be.\xc2\xa0 They all bring different tools to the table and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all got stakes in the outcome -- so making sure not only to include them in a well-coordinated process, but also bring the resources and specific policies they have to the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will also place a real focus on sustainable outcomes.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made great progress toward the MDG.\xc2\xa0 Our challenge going forward is to do more so that we make even more progress -- but importantly and in significant ways, make that sustainable.\xc2\xa0 How do we do that?\xc2\xa0 One emphasis is, as Mike mentioned, really focusing on inclusive economic growth that over time can allow countries to reduce their dependence.\xc2\xa0 A second is to help them build the systems that they need to provide services to their people.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are two other pieces here.\xc2\xa0 One is to place a real premium on mutual accountability.\xc2\xa0 That means as donors, we need to be more transparent, we need to honor the commitments we make; and on the other side, that leaders in developing countries need to step up to the plate.\xc2\xa0 And one of the very exciting things I think about this summit and today is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of evidence that a lot of countries are doing that; that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a real shift where the political capital needed to drive a development agenda is being invested by an increasing number of leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second piece here I think is about evidence.\xc2\xa0 This is a field, development, that the world has been at for a good 50 years.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that we know.\xc2\xa0 We intend to do a much more rigorous job on the front end and in terms of evaluating what we do to look at whether we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the outcomes we need and want; to look where we may need to change course to build up and bring to scale those things that work, and cease doing those things that, frankly, aren\xe2\x80\x99t generating the results that we and our partners want.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast point I would underscore is the development landscape has changed dramatically in the last decade if you look at the huge contributions made by the American people in the growing and strengthening of NGOs, if you look at the very robust philanthropic sector, particularly in our country with foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and new actors being at table.\xc2\xa0 Also on the private sector in many cases, a growing recognition not only that they want to pursue foreign direct investment, but that development is in their interest.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a much more active private sector community.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got many more actors at the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also got new donors coming to the table -- and South Korea is a great example.\xc2\xa0 Part of our task going forward is to really use our leadership to coordinate strategically with them, as Mike suggests, but also to use our leadership to leverage others so that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a more diverse set of actors bringing a more diverse set of tools to the table to, again, not just treat the manifestations of poverty, but to really make the investments over time that will enable us and our partners to turn it around.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will stop there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me add one last comment which is while this is the rolling out of the presidential policy directive on global development, many of the principles in it are already reflected in the major initiatives that the administration has taken over the last 18 months, including in food security, in global health, and in climate change.\xc2\xa0 And we can talk about those in specifics if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 But many of the concepts that we were just discussing are already being put in place through those major initiatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CHANG:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mike, and thank you, Gayle.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to open the floor to questions.\xc2\xa0 I want to do two quick reminders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne is that as the media advisory noted, Gayle and Mike\xe2\x80\x99s remarks are embargoed along with the text of the remarks the President is going to deliver that was set out a little earlier you should already have in your inboxes.\xc2\xa0 All of this is embargoed until delivery, which is estimated around 4:45 P.M. this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a pretty comprehensive fact sheet, series of fact sheets going out right after this call with information that will help supplement what Mike and Gayle are saying right now.\xc2\xa0 So on that note, please open the floor to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you\xe2\x80\x99re really prepared to address questions quite this focused, but does the policy see a role for advancing deployment and adoption of Internet access and broadband in developing countries in terms of their economic development?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can answer that.\xc2\xa0 This is Gayle.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address that specifically.\xc2\xa0 It does address innovation and the need to place a premium on research and development and the science and technologies that we know can make a transformative difference, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go into specific details such as that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President talks about being selective about where U.S. aid can best be deployed, should we assume that that means that some countries or areas that are currently getting aid will (audio drop) in the future?\xc2\xa0 And does this new strategy change any of your budget assumptions going forward for how much money the U.S. is going to spend --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you faded in and out there a little bit, but let me try and answer that.\xc2\xa0 And Gayle may want to amplify that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe concept of selectivity is that we want to focus additional resources but also policy engagement, diplomatic engagement -- really all the tools available to us to help support development on those countries where -- or sub-regions where we think the potential for achieving sustainable economic growth and becoming the next emerging market is -- are most ripe, where the conditions are most ripe.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe do not anticipate necessarily an effect on the budget number as a whole, but it could affect some reallocation within that number from some places to other places, or from some sectors to other sectors.\xc2\xa0 And the idea is really to make sure that we can act at scale in ways that achieve the objectives of the overall policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 And I would just add to that briefly on your question on the budget.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about both our intent to honor our commitments on that front -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking at a readjustment, as Mike said, of the overall numbers -- and also an intent -- the United States will continue to be a leader on providing humanitarian assistance and helping fill global gaps in things like global health and other areas.\xc2\xa0 We have no intention of dropping that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that to really get the transformation that we now know is possible, given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen around the world, we need a much more focused effort.\xc2\xa0 And we know a lot about development in terms of when the conditions are ripe to get the outcomes that we all desire.\xc2\xa0 And those things include, again, a government that\'s willing to put political capital into the game, an environment where citizens are empowered to do everything from starting businesses to engage in solving some of the other development challenges that a country faces.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I would add is that the notion of selectivity is married up to a notion of a far greater -- a far more strategic level of coordination with other donors.\xc2\xa0 If you look around the world, I think what you see in many countries is that a lot of donors doing a lot of everything and imposing enormous transaction costs on our partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe want to be able to sit down with other donors -- the diverse range of them -- and again, with our partners, be much more deliberate about what each of us does.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something we\xe2\x80\x99re already doing in the food security initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 I would like to know if President Obama is willing to support the proposal to tax financial transactions to help achieve the Millennium goals that was proposed by President Sarkozy and President Zapatero?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a shot at that.\xc2\xa0 We have been part of several processes to look at alternative finance mechanisms.\xc2\xa0 And we are comfortable with some of them more than others of them, and the financial transaction tax has been one proposal that has been out there both to -- it has been linked to both MDGs, it\xe2\x80\x99s been linked to climate change, it\xe2\x80\x99s also been linked to paying for bank bailouts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re in dialogue with -- through the G20 and otherwise with our -- with other countries about alternative finance mechanisms, including that one.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not one that we have publicly supported as of now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi there, and thanks for taking the time to talk to us.\xc2\xa0 I had a quick question about -- I think it was Mike\xe2\x80\x99s comment about USAID having a seat at the NSC when it was relevant.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to follow up on that and see if that meant that in fact the President has decided not to give the administrator a permanent seat at the NSC as some in the development community have called for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would just say that the way the NSC works, any agency that is relevant to a discussion can be asked to sit on it.\xc2\xa0 There are a set of core agencies that are part of the National Security Council for virtually every issue -- agencies like State, Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 And there are other agencies that are added to the process as appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And what this says is that the NSC can include USAID as appropriate when those issues are part of the discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 And I would simply add to that, that one of the interesting things about this policy is that a lot of it is already underway.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is that on all the major issues that we have tackled over the last months where there is any kind of, if you will, development equity, USAID has been at the table.\xc2\xa0 So on Haiti, on a number of issues, with respect to Pakistan -- on any number of issues.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s already something that\xe2\x80\x99s happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, thanks very much for chatting with us.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism at the U.N. this week about the U.S. actually fulfilling all of its development obligations or promises.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to know if you expect this policy to tamp down any of that criticism?\xc2\xa0 And does it come with any new money beyond what\xe2\x80\x99s already been pledged?\xc2\xa0 And then the second part of the question is about the reaction on the home front.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect any pushback from people in this country who are saying, you know, why are we sending so much aid overseas at a time of economic crisis at home?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take -- take a first cut at that.\xc2\xa0 I think on the question of the U.S. meeting our development commitments, quite frankly, we are meeting our development commitments.\xc2\xa0 One of the things at the recent G8 summit, for example, was talking a look at the Gleneagles commitments.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at both the G8 accountability report or the reports that outside groups have done, I think you will find that the United States was among those that in fact have met our commitments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has also announced well before this policy came out very early in his tenure the new global health initiative, which builds on what President Bush did, but in fact expands that both programmatically and in terms of dollars and a food security initiative, which importantly entailed a three-year new commitment from us, but which we also leveraged to turn into a $22 billion worldwide commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think we\xe2\x80\x99re fairly confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re right on target with meeting our commitments.\xc2\xa0 I think there are those -- and there will always be those -- who would like to see more money under different sectors or issues or so on and so forth.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be the case.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very firm commitment and you will certainly hear from the President that commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think on the home front, I would just say one quick thing and then I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mike wants to add.\xc2\xa0 I think part of the story we\xe2\x80\x99re telling the American people is, A, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use our dollars more wisely when it comes to aid.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to complement them with other tools.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to use our leadership to leverage engagement and resources from others.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend them more wisely.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus much more on evaluation, on building on what works and not doing what doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is part of this is about investing in our having more capable partners over time with whom we can engage to deal with a host of challenges, whether climate change, global pandemics, whatever it may be that we have to deal with collectively.\xc2\xa0 So I think we can tell a very good story about spending our resources more wisely, maximizing our resources through leveraging, and really turning our development dollars into a long-term investment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would only add -- I agree with all that.\xc2\xa0 I would only add to that, back on your first point, we -- the U.S. pressed very hard for transparency as to how the G8 countries, who are the major donors, have done vis-\xc3\xa0-vis their commitments.\xc2\xa0 And that report, as Gayle said, came out in Muskoka in June.\xc2\xa0 I commend it to you.\xc2\xa0 It goes commitment by commitment, country by country, what was committed to, what was done.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that the U.S. holds up very well there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I sort of dispute those who say that the U.S. has not upheld its commitment.\xc2\xa0 And the $63 billion global health initiative that Gayle mentioned puts us far and away ahead as the largest player in global health among all the donors.\xc2\xa0 So I think we are in very firm ground there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe only other point I would make on your second question -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear it from the President -- is a clear point of view that development is not just a moral imperative, but is a strategic and an economic imperative as well.\xc2\xa0 As Gayle said, we need to have capable partners, stable, growing, well-governed partners around the world to help us deal with the global challenges.\xc2\xa0 And we also need emerging markets as our own economy requires markets abroad for our exports.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is very much in the U.S. interests and I believe you will hear the President make the case as to why this is a core part of our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I was going to ask about the 0.7 percent GNI, but I think it was already asked and addressed fully.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thank you.\xc2\xa0 My question -- maybe this will be answered when you send out the fact sheet you referred to -- but I read the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech and some of the things he mentions as being a new emphasis -- economic growth, accountability on the part of those countries that receive the aid.\xc2\xa0 These are -- goals are already embraced in the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering are you talking more about these ideas being extended to the other -- the broader foreign aid programs, like USAID?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing two things.\xc2\xa0 I think, one, we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly learned a lot from the MCC, both about outcomes but also about, quite frankly, the incentives effect.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- our findings have been informed by that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re also talking about is, you know, the MCC might have a compact with a country but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, again, bring all these other resources to the table that both Mike and I have mentioned across the policy spectrum.</p>\n<p>\n\tA second thing I would say is that part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re also -- talking about the proof will be in the pudding, although I think we\xe2\x80\x99re quite confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be there -- is that concepts like accountability and transparency have been out there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve all committed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 I think you will hear a very forceful message from the President that we have to hold ourselves accountable to actually do the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s the other element of this, is really translating the promises that we as donors have made, even as we expect our partners to honor the commitments they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, into concrete, tangible and different ways of doing business.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike, do you want to add anything?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, I think you covered it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks for taking -- doing this call.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if the President\xe2\x80\x99s development policy -- does it include any goals or timetables -- you know, five years or 10 years out, where some of these countries that now are relying on U.S. assistance economically, development-wise, et cetera, will be able to function on their own and become the emerging markets that were talked about during the call, that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 It does not set a precise timetable and I think this is a -- this will be an ongoing and long-term project that\'s really turning the ship in a way that we do development policy.\xc2\xa0 And so it will take some time to be fully implemented, and it will take time for the implementation to have all the desired impact.\xc2\xa0 But it is setting out an objective that we want to work towards.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to ask you a couple of specific questions about the new policy.\xc2\xa0 According to a draft of the policy that was published earlier this year, it called for a standing interagency development policy committee to coordinate the development policy across the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 It also called for a U.S. global development strategy to be undertaken every four years and approved by the President.\xc2\xa0 Did both of these items make it into the final version of the presidential policy directive?\xc2\xa0 And also, could you please explain why the decision was made not to release the actual policy document to the public?\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Both of those elements did make it into the final presidential policy directive, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that reflected on the fact sheet when it\xe2\x80\x99s released.\xc2\xa0 And I think in terms of PPD of release, I think I\'ll probably have to refer you to somebody else at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s general policy that we can release a detailed summary of it, but as has been -- as I understand the policy, not to release PPDs themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CHANG:\xc2\xa0 And let me add that the fact sheet that will come out and hit your inboxes momentarily is very comprehensive and thorough and falls on the point that Mike just made about sending out a detailed and comprehensive summary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for holding this.\xc2\xa0 Can you just briefly tell us if you are going to earmark money for, say, Asia, for Africa, for the different continents, or is it going to be all one global fund?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. SMITH:\xc2\xa0 I can take that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not actually talking about creating a new fund, per se.\xc2\xa0 But no, we don\'t plan to, if you will, create different subsets for earmark.\xc2\xa0 I think we plan to base our analysis, again, on what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in terms of where the trends look right for the kind of investments we\xe2\x80\x99d like to make to get the results we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s our expectation that this is, indeed, as has been said and the President will make clear, this is a global development policy.\xc2\xa0 And I think that will be reflected.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:02 P.M.
