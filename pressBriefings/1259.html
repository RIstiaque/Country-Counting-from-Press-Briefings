EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the time since the gaggle, Mitch McConnell has given a speech in which he again said that his job is to deny the President a second term.\xc2\xa0 He also said that if the administration wants cooperation in the next two years, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to move in the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 direction.\xc2\xa0 Is that a position that the President can work with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 I think, first and foremost, the message of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s election was that the American people want both political parties to work together.\xc2\xa0 There will be time for another political campaign, but we just finished one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCandidates weren\xe2\x80\x99t elected to have more fighting in Washington or to re-fight the battles of the past two years.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, what the President said today in inviting Senator McConnell and other leaders to the White House on November 18th is to sit down, listen to each other, work together, and find common ground.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the election was about, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is intending to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you hear these remarks from McConnell, do you get the impression that the Republicans walked away from this election with that same message that you got?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, I think that if you look at candidates, a lot of candidates ran against Washington, and typically didn\xe2\x80\x99t portray Washington in their ads as a place where people listen and work together.\xc2\xa0 So I think in and of -- given those dynamics and those images, what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is what those campaigns were about -- working together.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, look, we will -- the President yesterday signaled -- and again today -- his intention to work with Republicans on extending tax cuts, our first priority obviously being the middle class; to work with Republicans on things like education policy, improving our schools; and to work with them on energy independence, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not wedded to all of our ideas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hope that Senator McConnell comes to the White House with that in mind in a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just back to tax cuts for a second.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of been talking around this and I think you mentioned it in the gaggle, but the President is open to a possible compromise in extending the upper-income tax cuts for possibly one or two years --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do the negotiations here, but we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to listening to their position, talking about it and working together to find a compromise that moves this issue forward.\xc2\xa0 Our biggest concern is if this Congress does not act by the end of the year, taxes for middle-class families is going to go up.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, let that happen.\xc2\xa0 We have the power to change that and I think the power is sitting together and coming up with a plan that works for both sides.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is confident that we can do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the White House hopeful that the actions that the Fed took yesterday will help the economy grow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, they counsel me ad nauseam not to comment on the Fed and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go crossways to said good counseling.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things that the election told us was people are rightly concerned and frustrated by the pace of our economic recovery, even as we\xe2\x80\x99re pointed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that is the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip abroad in broadening our market -- broadening our ability to sell in markets like India, South Korea and throughout Asia.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned at all that there are countries that you will be meeting at the G20 who have reacted poorly to this and saying that it will hurt your ability to get --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into commenting on the actions of the Fed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try one other thing, then.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned this morning -- the President mentioned this morning that taxes will be one of the major priorities during the lame-duck session.\xc2\xa0 What other priorities would you list in the next couple months?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think the President -- and the President listed this and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important -- and that is getting ratified a new reduction in our nuclear arsenal with Russia by approving the START treaty.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think this is a place where bipartisan traditions have always held.\xc2\xa0 The very first START treaty passed 93 to 6.\xc2\xa0 The most recent treaty was approved 95 to nothing.\xc2\xa0 There was a strong bipartisan vote out of the Foreign Relations Committee on this, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why people from Sam Nunn on the Democratic side to Senator Lugar on the Republican side, Henry Kissinger on the Republican side, George Shultz on the Republican side believe that reducing our nuclear arsenal is a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think there are some other pieces of legislation that are close that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish at the end -- things like child nutrition, which obviously is a huge priority for the First Lady, and no doubt we want to get our budget director confirmed.\xc2\xa0 Our fiscal situation is something that this administration, the fiscal commission and Congress will spend a lot of time on.\xc2\xa0 And it makes sense to have a budget director in order to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick one on START, again, do you think that this election, the results would have -- could have any effect on the viability of the START agreement?\xc2\xa0 Could it slow it down?\xc2\xa0 And also, I just wanted to follow up with that story coming out of India that the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip is allegedly costing $200 million a day -- 3,000 people.\xc2\xa0 Can you set the record straight exactly?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have set the record straight with you guys.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into how much it costs to protect the President.\xc2\xa0 Costs are comparable to when President Clinton and when President Bush traveled abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the same report that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to said that there were -- I think it was 34 warships off the coast, which I understand the Department of Defense has said -- as we have -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not true.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the START treaty, I think -- I do not think that the election should change the -- again, the bipartisan history of arms reductions.\xc2\xa0 It was, after all -- I think the last President to call for a world without nuclear weapons before President Obama did that in 2009 was Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is an issue that has enjoyed support well across the political spectrum and across party lines, and I think it would be a good message to send both the American people and the world that we can work together on issues of mutual interest and concern like reducing nuclear weapons in this world and demonstrating for the world that we are -- we\xe2\x80\x99re serious.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned also today that our actions at reducing our nuclear weapons, our nuclear stockpile and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear stockpile is sending a powerful message around the world as we seek to hold Iran responsible for the commitments that it has made, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important to message to carry through.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have said, and the President also suggested, that the message of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s elections is that the American people want the parties to work together.\xc2\xa0 Where do you get that from?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if you look at -- both parties are -- both parties in the exit poll were not held in tremendously high regard.\xc2\xa0 I think Washington writ large was not held in high regard, and I think people disapproved of -- according to those polls -- the way Congress worked.\xc2\xa0 I think if you were to look at how to fix that, it\xe2\x80\x99s working together.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what most people took.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The same exit poll indicated that a majority of the American people think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies will do long-term harm to the nation.\xc2\xa0 I know the President said that if unemployment were lower they\xe2\x80\x99d have more confidence in the policies.\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re going by that exit poll, it would seem that the message from Tuesday is they don\xe2\x80\x99t like what this administration is doing and, therefore, when the Republicans say they were elected to stop what the President is doing, at least based on the same exit poll you cite, they have a case to make.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think if you look at -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take the issue of health care, which I think is what Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s speech was on.\xc2\xa0 I think most of the people that cited health care as an issue for voting supported the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think almost evenly split were improving or keeping what we have versus repeal.\xc2\xa0 So again, I think we are -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen independents in, quite frankly, the last three election cycles side with different political parties.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s because they want Washington to work for them, not against them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the message that we took from this campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since Senator McConnell today did say that the Republicans would be pressing repeatedly in his words to repeal the health care bill and to repeal the financial bill -- he suggested also the financial regulation reform -- will the President veto any efforts to do either of those?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t think, Jake, it will come to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I just mentioned health care reform.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly nothing in the message I think that came out of Tuesday that suggests that going back to the health care system that allowed insurance companies to control whether or not patients that think they have policies are covered when they get sick, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any data suggests that that\xe2\x80\x99s what people want to see after Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it relates to financial reform, there -- rules were put in place to change the behavior of Wall Street and to prevent what happened in September of 2008 and what led up to it from ever happening again.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- I think those are commonsense policies that the American people strongly believe in.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s protecting consumers, ensuring that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t hoodwinked into bad loans, making sure that trading things like derivatives are done in the light of day on an exchange rather than not, is what is people want.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McConnell said he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to -- if he can\xe2\x80\x99t repeal the bill, which he suggested that Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to because of the President being in the White House, and Democrats still controlling the Senate, they will at least try to starve the health care bill by depriving it of funding.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I should have been more specific.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- would the President veto those kinds of efforts?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President indicated an openness to the repeal of the 1099 aspect of the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Are there other provisions that the White House has identified that you guys think could go or be revised?\xc2\xa0 Any specifics at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- Mike, I think the President looks forward to hearing from during these upcoming meetings what Republicans -- what\xe2\x80\x99s on Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 minds as it relates to that.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the issue of 1099s was something that many have talked about changing because, as the President said, the burdensome paperwork on business doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But -- so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak, quite frankly, for what aspects of that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see changed.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that it is dangerous to go back to, as I said earlier, a system where insurance companies made decisions rather than doctors and patients, and that some of the protections like a family being able to keep somebody up to the age of 26, or not being denied coverage because of a so-called preexisting condition are important protections that the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see rolled back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any redline provisions or whatever that you think are deal-breakers in terms of -- that absolutely have to say, if there are negotiations?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think I outlined a series -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for what the Republicans have in mind.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that many of the protections that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about over the past many months are very important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously you and the Pentagon have spoken about the India stories that have been out there.\xc2\xa0 Are you surprised that there are kind of these stories about lots of protection, or more planes than usual?\xc2\xa0 Is there something about this trip that\xe2\x80\x99s different than others?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, whenever you move any President in a foreign country, you not surprisingly take certain precautions.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the first stop on our trip is at a memorial for victims of a terrorist attack, November 26, 2009, at the hotel we\xe2\x80\x99re staying at.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously the Secret Service takes the duty of protecting this and any President seriously.\xc2\xa0 They do an amazing job.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just trying to make sense -- just trying to make sense of -- he\xe2\x80\x99s traveled overseas before -- why are there articles this time about this trip being different than perhaps others?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question for whatever media is writing these stories in India.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow, Robert?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you guys reopening health care?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you believe this is a settled issue?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the -- again, I think the President mentioned something specific yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I think Democrats and Republicans want to change that paperwork requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99d be okay on that, but nothing else?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Chuck, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their list is.\xc2\xa0 But again, I will say that -- I think Senator McConnell said today we should listen to -- we listen to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the exit poll we cited was evenly split.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he heard that the others didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess to go with that, the exit poll is evenly -- that is a fair way to read it -- evenly split.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That does mean half the country, or half the folks that went and voted, don\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all.\xc2\xa0 Should there be some acknowledgment --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It also means -- it also means half --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but is there anything to -- that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 I mean, but is there any -- do you feel that you should open up this for some discussion for more additional things than just this paperwork requirement?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we look forward to having meetings and people bringing constructive ideas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reading these exit polls a little bit, there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple things that stand out.\xc2\xa0 One is there was clearly a Democratic base problem -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up.\xc2\xa0 A lot of voters didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up in Missouri and Pennsylvania and Ohio, turnout down compared to 2006.\xc2\xa0 Why do you guys think that is?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to some of the political folks on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what in those particular states or among those different regions might have impacted it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we saw in some places Democratic enthusiasm and turnout up.\xc2\xa0 It certainly varies from state to state.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys take from this election that you have a policy problem or a communications problem?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we have economic problems.\xc2\xa0 I think we have 8.5 million people that lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I think what the American people want both political parties to do is stop the squabbling and start working together.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we took.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has offered Republicans and Democrats in coming to the White House and in continuing that conversation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see over the next many months.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the way, should we expect a golf outing between the Speaker-to-be and the President anytime soon?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have to say, Mr. Boehner looks like a pretty good golfer so I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I think he would -- might take some money from the President on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m probably in trouble for saying that now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For all of the talk yesterday and today of cooperation and reaching out and working together, what the President said yesterday didn\xe2\x80\x99t indicate that he thought there was anything wrong in his policies.\xc2\xa0 He blamed everything on the economy and nothing on his policies, per se.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think, Bill, 60-some percent of the people said they voted based on the economy.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think the President, and I think he said this yesterday, and certainly has before -- that the pace of economic recovery is one that has frustrated he and the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but a number of the people who fall into the category of people who voted based on the economy believe that the economy is in the state it\xe2\x80\x99s in because of his policies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s many economists that would -- again, I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- if you look at where we were in -- when the President took the oath of office and the jobs report for that month and where we have been, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously in a different direction.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spent any time studying the history around President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s history when he faced a similar situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He was reading -- what\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Taylor Branch.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he was reading Taylor Branch.\xc2\xa0 I knew he mentioned it in Peter\xe2\x80\x99s interview.\xc2\xa0 But other than that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what lessons he\xe2\x80\x99s taken away from that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly talk to him and see what --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when the President says he wants to work on the people\xe2\x80\x99s business --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me separate these two before there\xe2\x80\x99s a fistfight.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he says he wants to work on the people\xe2\x80\x99s business, which people is he talking about -- the people that elected Rand Paul and Marco Rubio or the people that reelected Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what they have in common is they\xe2\x80\x99re Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s about it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, they have irreconcilable differences, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, the President spent a lot of time traveling around the country, and I think he always said that there were -- we tend to put people in boxes and all that sort of stuff on television and everybody disagrees on this and everybody disagrees on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in a room with those leaders, per se, but I bet if people listen long enough they\xe2\x80\x99d find things that they agree on.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99d find things that they could work on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is everybody\xe2\x80\x99s -- is the solution that everybody brings to the beginning of that meeting going to be what we all walk out with?\xc2\xa0 Probably not.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some give-and-take on each side.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to make progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in this country that would have you believe that the message that people took away from this campaign was gridlock, more arguing, more bickering, more partisan, more not working together -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- people ran against the way this town works.\xc2\xa0 And to go back to the way it\xe2\x80\x99s always operated would be the wrong message.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Republican side, it seems they ran against give-and-take, compromise.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want gridlock, either.\xc2\xa0 They want you to surrender.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that largely the message -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that what they said drove them to run for office because somehow that happened on the other side?\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an incongruence that is maybe a subtlety that\xe2\x80\x99s lost during the back-and-forth of a political campaign.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t make progress -- and you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not going to make progress in a divided government saying, my way or the highway.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to end up with a lot more of what drove people away from having faith in both parties and in their government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want to see.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they want to see an endless recitation of last week\xe2\x80\x99s battles, because we have problems that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t faced and that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t dealt with and that we know if we don\xe2\x80\x99t are going to put us at a competitive economic advantage [sic] as it relates to the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not what -- the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that, and I think you have a good number of Republicans that believe that, too, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier you mentioned the President would invite CEOs to the White House to help ease that relation.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details on timing or who or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not yet.\xc2\xa0 There have been some internal discussions about it but there\xe2\x80\x99s no details beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it part of a series of meetings that you\xe2\x80\x99re planning to have?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a series of CEOs in for several years -- lunches, events -- and I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll not only continue that, but talk a little bit and do a little bit about what the President talked about yesterday in terms of business.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the state of play on the free trade agreement with Korea now that -- ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President outlined the concerns that he had both during the campaign in 2008 and just recently with what he thinks has to be improved in an agreement that he can support and he can be a party to.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s autos or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s other issues, we know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make some progress.\xc2\xa0 And I think both sides are going to sit down and see if they can make some of that progress.\xc2\xa0 And if we can make enough progress to where the President feels like, for instance, on autos, there\xe2\x80\x99s a better deal for our automakers and for our workers, then it will be something that we can support.\xc2\xa0 If not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to keep trying.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How likely will it be that it is announced during the trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that depends on the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I think that depends on the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s made in changing what the President felt was an agreement that was tilted against auto companies and autoworkers here in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond the meeting on the 18th, is there any sort of a plan to create some sort of structural bipartisan -- something going forward to address the new reality in Washington?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not following you.\xc2\xa0 Like what?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s this bipartisan meeting happening on the 18th.\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan to make a regular --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, right.\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan to make some sort of a regular White House bipartisan event, something going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know we have -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked here and I think the President is anxious to talk to leaders on both sides on the 18th about what they think is -- what do they think are the ways best going forward.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is -- as you heard him say in the Cabinet Room, this is more -- this has to be and it will be more than just a photo op.\xc2\xa0 We have -- obviously have substantive business to work through and issues that we have to make progress on.\xc2\xa0 So I anticipate that this is the first of many.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said there are no major staff shakeups to announce, but is there anything minor, either, in the Office of Legislative Affairs, in the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office, to deal with investigations, oversight that may be coming down the road, staffing up for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of or that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions.\xc2\xa0 Last year --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are always just two, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there, Lester?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Last year, that influential Democratic leader, James Carville\xe2\x80\x99s new book was entitled, \xe2\x80\x9c40 More Years:\xc2\xa0 How the Democrats Will Rule the Next Generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Have you and the President read this book, and if so, what was your reaction to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not read the book and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has, either, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to comment on it.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Could you specify which trip President Bush ever took which cost $200 million a day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, this trip doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cost $200 million a day, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was what was reported all over the world.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So let me get this straight, Lester.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another questioner asked about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, you subscribe to the veracity of everything that you read in the press, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, not everything, but several things.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But just the things that you previously agreed on that you agree with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you denying that it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We seem to be several steps down a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you denying that it\xe2\x80\x99s $200 million a day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For about the third time, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re denying -- how much is it, then?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into what it costs to protect the President.\xc2\xa0 But the same report, Lester -- if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, which I can understand -- surely you would --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to believe you.\xc2\xa0 I enjoy you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate that, Lester.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we leave you two guys alone?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With a Slurpee and a twisty straw.\xc2\xa0 Can I -- again, Lester, I think the same report said there were 34 warships.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon said that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 We said -- we now seem to have come almost full circle on a circular argument, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I had read it somewhere else that it was a different cost, would it be true?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You just said you believed everything that you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, this came from a number of different sources, Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh.\xc2\xa0 So, again, if you\xe2\x80\x99d read that the cost was different other places, how would you reconcile those differences?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just have two questions on that tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And you believe, consequently, everything that\xe2\x80\x99s in it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- you seem to have some -- I thought a minute ago -- can I see the transcript of that?\xc2\xa0 I thought you said that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have to be selective.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President believes, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s common agreement on extending permanently the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand what happens if we don\xe2\x80\x99t act by the end of the year -- those tax rates will go back up.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s common ground to be found in how to move forward.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe and I think would not accept permanently extending the upper-end tax cuts, which we know the cost of that is borrowing $700 billion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that having been said, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s something that can be come to between that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when he said he was ready to negotiate, the one thing -- part of it that he\xe2\x80\x99s not ready to negotiate on is a permanent upper-income tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Michael Steele yesterday asked for a meeting with President Obama, and will the White House grant it in the air of consensus?\xc2\xa0 And he says that also that he\xe2\x80\x99s for consensus but the President governs from the left and he needs from the far left.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is governing from the far left and he needs to come to the center for there to be a consensus.\xc2\xa0 What say you on those questions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think consensus is, again, not going to be 100 percent of what anybody wants.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question for Mr. Steele would be, does he believe consensus then is 100 percent of what he wants?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, will the President grant Mr. Steele a meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- I have not heard from scheduling that there\xe2\x80\x99s a pending request.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you do get a question from --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for scheduling on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I assume that the arguments that the chairman of the Republican Party is going to make would be brought up by those that are in the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it would be a redundant meeting if he were to come -- if he were to ask -- so you would say no --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just think the viewpoints that -- I assume his -- well, most of his statements are in line with what the leaders have said.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there have been some diversions on some issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The President was criticized during the health care debate for investing too much time in bipartisan outreach, in effect, for waiting for the Republicans to come along when in fact their cooperation never was forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 Is there a period now where the President might see if Republicans are willing to meet him halfway, and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, he may decide that that time is not well spent and bipartisan cooperation is just not going to happen in this new reconfigured Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Peter, as I said this morning, I think we now have -- and I think let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, Republicans now control and have the responsibility for governing half of Congress.\xc2\xa0 So there are certainly responsibilities that are going to go along with something like that, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the President is eager to sit down, eager to listen and eager to work together.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him or others discuss what happens if.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the message we took from this election was working together.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going into the G20, does the President have a message for emerging markets of these fast-growing economies like Brazil who are worried that the actions of this country are going to create bubbles in their own?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, what we have talked about at each of the G20s is the need to find strategies for balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 And the President has discussed throughout this the fear that what we have seen that\xe2\x80\x99s driven economic growth in the past, the sort of bubble-and-bust economies that may, in the short term, drive demand but find the consequences of that demand on the back end detrimental, that we certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t continue to also do that on a worldwide basis.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t -- the American consumer can\xe2\x80\x99t drive worldwide demand, which is part of the reason we have to open up other markets around the world, and emerging markets, for the sale of our goods.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, I think Secretary Geithner at the G20 finance ministers meeting talked about and got the cooperation of those throughout the world in seeking a path toward that balanced growth in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the McConnell speech for a moment.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want the President to fail.\xc2\xa0 I want him to change.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You can decide what degree of wanting to compromise that is, but do you really believe he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the President to fail?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let he and his spokespeople speak for him.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not think that the American people two days after a contentious election are -- believe that the next election should start the next day.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a period of time in which we\xe2\x80\x99ll have for that election, but that we have a period of time that we need to work together to address those problems.\xc2\xa0 I hope that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s also been reported as saying he wants President Obama to be a one-term President, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he said that was the single most important job he had.\xc2\xa0 I think the single most important job that the American people and the President want to work on are creating jobs and strengthening our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A question on -- or actually a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 A couple weeks ago, there was the Indian farmers settlement.\xc2\xa0 The President still has an outstanding request for $1.25 billion to settle with what the Justice Department says are 66,000 African American farmers discriminated against by the USDA between \xe2\x80\x9881 and \xe2\x80\x9896.\xc2\xa0 Beyond compensation, first question, would there be like accountability on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, will the administration insist that some of those USDA employees who did practice discrimination be fired or disciplined?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you over to USDA in terms of what was listed inside of that settlement related to things like that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, will there be a accountability aspect to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not read the judgment of the settlement, and I would point you over to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question would be, where do think requests for $1.25 billion stands now with the new Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that it was outstanding in the last Congress.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will be in -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on whether it would be in spending bills that would be done by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since Democrats control the Senate now, would it possibly go through?\xc2\xa0 Because Republicans were the holdup in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the settlement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, do you think -- I mean, do you think, though, the climate is more conducive for it to come through?\xc2\xa0 The White House and the President have said that he wants it to go through Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And he does.\xc2\xa0 And April, again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legislative update on this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How quickly would you expect the President to name a new director of the National Economic Council?\xc2\xa0 And should the American people anticipate that there will be any changes in the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet between now and early next year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I know that obviously there are and have been organizational meetings that have gone on through here that the chief of staff is -- a process that he\xe2\x80\x99s overseeing.\xc2\xa0 We are I think in the preliminary stages of selecting a new NEC director, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that in the next couple weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll have any announcements on that.\xc2\xa0 And I know of nothing in terms of the Cabinet.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a natural cycle of people coming into the administration pledging to stay for two years, and returning back to the pursuits or -- either new pursuits that they had or -- that they have or what brought them -- what they were doing before they came here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, we know that the currency issue would be the -- it\xe2\x80\x99s high on the agenda for the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Asia.\xc2\xa0 And will the White House push harder on the issue, because -- in response to the result of the midterm elections?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, it was a concern of this administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a bipartisan concern of Capitol Hill even before this election.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that concern certainly in any way is lessened.\xc2\xa0 The President and the Secretary have said that China has to take steps and that we will evaluate and watch what they do.\xc2\xa0 And I have no doubt that this will be a topic that is talked about at the G20, at the APEC meetings, and directly with the Chinese.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also -- sorry -- and Reuters has a report saying that NSC senior director Jeff Bader said the U.S. and its allies are seeking to rebalance to the -- seeking to rebalance the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check in on that.\xc2\xa0 My sense is it\xe2\x80\x99s not in -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t second-guess Jeff on what he says, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which Jeff are you talking about?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did you write the story?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Either Mason or Bader, \xe2\x80\x9ccomma\xe2\x80\x9d Jeff.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on what the report is you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, still trying to understand this possible middle ground here on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I hear you say the President wants to change the 1099 thing, and then open to other ideas they may come up with.\xc2\xa0 But yesterday again --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I think I said that -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is going to prejudge what Republicans want to talk to him about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what getting together and talking about things are.\xc2\xa0 I think the President obviously is a big supporter of his health care plan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to misstate what you said.\xc2\xa0 But we do hear from John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, we heard it very clearly:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cRepeal, repeal, repeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all they talk about.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a non-starter, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, when that\xe2\x80\x99s where they start?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people said out of this election that they wanted to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But where\xe2\x80\x99s the middle ground if they\xe2\x80\x99re just all for repeal?\xc2\xa0 I mean, where do you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what some of these meetings and discussions might be about.\xc2\xa0 I think both sides would agree that this provision that is overly burdensome paperwork-wise for business is -- makes sense to change.\xc2\xa0 I think we -- there was an effort to try to do that before the election that got held up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, the President, I think, thinks that first and foremost our focus should be on the economy.\xc2\xa0 I think tax cuts is certainly important on his list because of what happens at the end of the year if we don\xe2\x80\x99t act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just, I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping -- sort of in that same vein -- but I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping you can clarify what you said to Jake.\xc2\xa0 You said -- Jake asked you if you anticipate the President would veto attempts at repeal.\xc2\xa0 You said you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will come to that.\xc2\xa0 What do you envision will stop it from coming to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to make its way through both Houses.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also ask just on a different topic.\xc2\xa0 You all are going out of the country for 10 days.\xc2\xa0 Most of the people here are leaving.\xc2\xa0 I know Bill is staying.\xc2\xa0 Republicans obviously won\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking while you all are gone.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a plan in place to sort of deal with what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying while you\xe2\x80\x99re gone?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, not a how-to-stop-Republicans-talking plan.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can confirm that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have one of those.\xc2\xa0 But, look, you know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you looked for one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on one of those warships that Les has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the President, I think, has -- will on several occasions on the trip meet with the traveling press, and we -- my sense is you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely ask about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on both over there and back here.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s expected and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, yesterday at this press conference the President seemed to acknowledge, at least in the short term, we\xe2\x80\x99re not likely to see a bill that would impose a price on carbon emissions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, how does he explain that to other world leaders who are looking to the U.S. for action on global warming?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President has said and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- there are certainly bipartisan proposals that would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases but not necessarily have to be done through what is commonly referred to as a cap-and-trade system.\xc2\xa0 You could, for instance, as many states have done throughout the country, have a renewable energy standard that said a certain amount of your power will be generated using renewable sources, which obviously would cut down, by definition, on greenhouse gases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that in this case there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one way to skin a cat.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President has -- and I mentioned this this morning -- the President has made some -- you know, changed our -- changed a policy that had been -- that had not seen a loan guarantee on behalf of a construction of a nuclear plant in three decades.\xc2\xa0 We entered into one of those just late last year.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- generating power that way is by definition going to reduce greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think there -- people are still concerned both about climate change as well as our ever-growing dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one way to fix that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the ways that we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on is working with car companies to increase fuel efficiency standards, not just on cars and make that happen actually faster than the legislation requires, but also for the first time on trucks.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a legislative thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s working with business to bring about change in energy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up on the question that Sam asked.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that the era of not attacking the President when he leaves our shores is over?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that, given this climate, that there will be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t think Sam is going to attack the President when he leaves --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, do you believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Easy, man.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just kidding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that the Republicans will honor that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if it still exists -- protocol or gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s agreement where when a President leaves our shores, partisan attacks are limited, shall we say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s been what, in previous times, has been what most in Washington followed.\xc2\xa0 I think the President, again, goes overseas on this trip on behalf of not one political party but on behalf of a country to improve our relationship with a very important region of the world, a fast-growing economic place where, again, at the very beginning of the trip I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see working with American businesses and CEOs to open up markets and create jobs here in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave what the Republicans do and say about that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think is going to happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I stopped guessing a long time ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:29 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
