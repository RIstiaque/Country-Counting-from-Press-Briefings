EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, I have one quick announcement.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, August 29th, President Obama will travel to New Orleans, Louisiana, to mark the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.\xc2\xa0 The visit will include remarks by the President at Xavier University of Louisiana.\xc2\xa0 Members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet who have worked to speed recovery and restoration efforts in the region also will be in New Orleans to mark the anniversary.\xc2\xa0 We will have more on that trip obviously as it gets closer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, we are joined today by Secretary Napolitano.\xc2\xa0 As you know, just a little while ago, with Secretary Napolitano, the President signed into law a border security bill that puts more agents and more equipment along the Mexican border.\xc2\xa0 And she is here to talk about that, our efforts to bolster the border region since coming into office.\xc2\xa0 And I will turn it over to the Secretary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for being here today.\xc2\xa0 I was very pleased to be with the President earlier as he signed a bill providing $600 million in additional resources to further strengthen security along the Southwest border.\xc2\xa0 We applaud Congress for acting in a bipartisan manner to take quick action on this bill.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to especially thank leaders Reid and Pelosi, and also Schumer and McCaskill.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThe legislation adds permanent resources that will continue to bolster security along the Southwest border, supporting our efforts to crack down on transnational criminal organizations, and reduce the trafficking of people, drugs, currency and weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bill is important in two respects.\xc2\xa0 First, it adds new resources to the border.\xc2\xa0 Second, it makes permanent many of the assets that this administration has surged along the border during the past 18 months.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, let me pause there for a moment.\xc2\xa0 I have worked on border issues as a public servant for 17 years, starting in 1993, as United States state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney in Arizona, then the attorney general of Arizona, then the governor of Arizona, continuing through today as the Secretary of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s significant about this bill, in addition to its contents, is that it passed something with bipartisan support that gives us the resources to continue efforts that were well underway, and demonstrates that the border is not and should not be a political issue; it is a matter of national security in which we all, both parties, have a stake.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on that score, even before the President signed this bill, the administration had already devoted more resources to the Southwest than any point in American history.\xc2\xa0 These efforts are making a difference.\xc2\xa0 And they are the reason why everything that is supposed to be going up is going up, and everything that is supposed to be going down is going down.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nSeizures are up and rose across the board last year.\xc2\xa0 Apprehensions for illegal crossings are down.\xc2\xa0 For the first time ever, we are screening 100 percent of southbound rail. Criminal alien removals are at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve added more technology, manpower, and resources to the border than ever before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a long-term, systematic effort to defeat the cartels and to continue to secure the border.\xc2\xa0 The administration is dedicated to that approach.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President ordered 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why he asked Congress for this supplemental funding.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the bill.\xc2\xa0 In terms of manpower, the bill provides for 1,000 additional Border Patrol agents.\xc2\xa0 It contains $68 million for Customs and Border Protection officers at or ports of entry, facilitating legal traffic and interdicting contraband.\xc2\xa0 It enables ICE -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- to hire more than 200 special agents, investigators and intelligence analysts who will help combat narcotic smuggling and their associated violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt provides for two more unmanned aircraft systems, and has $14 million to deploy improved tactical communications technology that will improve enforcement, particularly along some of the more remote areas of the border.\xc2\xa0 It also includes $196 million for the Justice Department to surge federal law enforcement, add prosecutors, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration of criminal aliens in coordination with our Homeland Security enforcement efforts.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of infrastructure, it includes $6 million for two forward-operating bases to improve our border enforcement activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis bill is clearly another step forward on border security, on top of the significant progress that the administration has already made.\xc2\xa0 It is one of the many tools in the toolbox we have constructed along the border.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we\'re very pleased with the swift passage, very pleased the President was able to sign this bill into law today. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano, when the President spoke about immigration last month, one of the points he made is that our borders are just too vast for us to be able to solve the problem only with fences and border patrols; it won\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 Our borders will not be secure as long as our limited resources are devoted to not only stopping gangs and potential terrorists but also the hundreds and thousands who attempt to cross each year simply to find work.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration now in any way conceding that comprehensive immigration reform is not tenable, that you can\xc2\xa0 actually fix this problem, bill by bill?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I would say quite the opposite.\xc2\xa0 I think the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position is that this bill adds to significant border security efforts that have been underway for the past 18 months.\xc2\xa0 And the administration is very intent now in saying, look, this bill passed on a bipartisan basis.\xc2\xa0 Now let\xe2\x80\x99s get Republicans to the table finally so we can address the whole issue of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 These are not sequential items; these are things that should be done together. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in your sense, having gotten this piece through, and knowing the politics as well as the policy, that comprehensive reform is still something that could happen in the next couple years?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO: Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And it needs to happen. And again, I say this as someone with a lot of experience with the immigration issue and along the border.\xc2\xa0 We need a safe and secure border.\xc2\xa0 This is a 2,000-mile, roughly, expanse.\xc2\xa0 It involves a lot of legitimate and legal trade of commerce, goods, tourism, people that need to be able to go back and forth.\xc2\xa0 So the border area itself needs to be safe and secure.\xc2\xa0 But as a nation we also need immigration reform.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bill, let me just add this.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President has talked about this. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned in here before, the President has worked on this in 2005, 2006, 2007, as a member of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 Leaders in the Senate made tough decisions and tough votes to get a bill because Democrats and Republicans worked together.\xc2\xa0 Nothing is going to happen on this issue in a comprehensive way that only involves one party or one person.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano\xe2\x80\x99s home state had leaders that were willing to make tough votes, willing to roll up their sleeves and be leaders.\xc2\xa0 And the question is -- we will get comprehensive immigration reform when we go back to a time in which both Democrats and Republicans are willing to be leaders.\xc2\xa0 And only then.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to go through the Senate or the House or Congress and come to any President\xe2\x80\x99s desk because one party has willed it to do so.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess that\'s my point, just to finish up on this, is that there always seemed to be strong support at some level for securing the border but not for the more difficult parts, including guest worker program and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So how does this differ from that?\xc2\xa0 You got the part that both parties can support.\xc2\xa0 Where does the rest come from?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the efforts on overall immigration reform are ongoing, but the point I\'m making is that you need to multitask.\xc2\xa0 You need to secure the border and have a safe and secure border area, and you need immigration reform. That\'s what this President has set out to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he has asked the Department of Homeland Security to work on.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he has invited Republicans and Republican leadership to the table, said, look, let\xe2\x80\x99s get to the issue of immigration reform.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the same time, we want to make sure that the border itself and that 2,000-mile expanse is safe and secure.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following on that, I\'m wondering if you could talk a little more specifically about the President\xe2\x80\x99s timetable for bringing about comprehensive immigration reform, for getting Republicans to the table.\xc2\xa0 And how much will this be contingent on the outcome of the November elections?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that if Republicans increase in strength then the prospects diminish?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the purpose of our briefing here today is to talk about this bill, its significance, the fact that it passed in a bipartisan fashion, and very swiftly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President made a formal request for this supplemental funding I think in June, and we are now -- we have already begun moving resources, in addition to what we had already put at the border, to the border.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will allow us to make some of those movements permanent.\xc2\xa0 And the addition of 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on top of the 20,000 we already have, that is significant.\xc2\xa0 Two hundred more ICE agents that we can devote to special investigations involving the cartels that use that border and its trafficking routes, that is very significant.\xc2\xa0 Unmanned aerial systems that we can add to the ones we already have, along with the fixed-wing and helicopters that we have, that allows us to have the capacity for 24/7 air coverage along this border.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the most kind of systemic border security package -- when you add everything together that has happened -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not to be impolite, the question was, what is the timetable for -- now that you have this bill, which is significant and clearly lays the groundwork for comprehensive immigration reform -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the timetable for the next step? And how much is it contingent on the elections?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 The President has said from the beginning that immigration reform is a priority for him.\xc2\xa0 He had reiterated that as recently as the speech at American University, which you were quoting from, and he has invited Congress to the table.\xc2\xa0 But again, as was said earlier, this is in the hands of the Congress and they will need to address this in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t only be done by Democrats; the Republicans need to be willing to come to the table.\xc2\xa0 The timetable question should be addressed to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think, just to add one thing, nobody has suggested that I have heard that only one step needs to be taken to have comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 This is an aspect of it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something we always mention, but there are obviously other aspects that are needed and that people are interested in doing. And the President has reached out to and has talked to Democrats and Republicans on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We just need a little support to make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you don\'t get those other aspects, if you don\'t get comprehensive reform, is this not just then a drop in a bucket in attacking the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO: No.\xc2\xa0 And I say this again as someone who is from a border state and has governed a border state.\xc2\xa0 The border region is an important, critical area for this country.\xc2\xa0 So much trade and commerce occurs along there. People live in communities along that border region.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that border region is safe and secure.\xc2\xa0 We want -- and that requires a law enforcement approach that includes manpower, that includes infrastructure, that includes technology.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why this bill, added to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve already done, gives us the resources necessary for that kind of a system to be in place.\xc2\xa0 That makes a lot of difference for people who live in that area and for the country as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask you about -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the crossings are down.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit more about that in terms of the numbers?\xc2\xa0 And to what degree do you think that is the result of the economy, that there simply aren\xe2\x80\x99t the jobs here now for people to want to cross the border?\xc2\xa0 And to what degree is it because of specific measures that have been taken by this administration?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 We can give you specific numbers, but I can tell you from my own experience that crossings are down, I have to say, 50 percent, 60 percent from even a few years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people believe that almost all of that is because of the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to say that the economy has something to do with it, but it is also fair to say that the additional law enforcement resources at the border also have something to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s a third factor, I think, that should be taken into account, and that is we have undertaken really an unprecedented partnership with Mexican law enforcement, with the Calder\xc3\xb3n administration, with law enforcement on the Southern side of the border, and that also is having an effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that, can you quantify what this extra money and resources is going to mean in terms of percentages of all the things that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to curtail?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you were trying to limit the activity of drug cartels, of narco-trafficking, of human trafficking -- $600 million, 1,200 National Guard troops -- how much of an effect is that going to have?\xc2\xa0 Can you quantify it in terms of numbers and percentages?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s always difficult to quantify a negative, how much have you prevented from occurring.\xc2\xa0 But what we can give you are exact numbers on how much crossings have gone down and how much seizures have gone up, and that will give you some of the matrix.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now you\xe2\x80\x99re adding more resources.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is -- critics might say, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing this in, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing this for political show in order to lay the groundwork for November, in order to lay the groundwork or the predicate for pursuing comprehensive reform at some point in the future. What effect is this actually going to have?\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the genesis of the question I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think you will see crossings continue to go down, and I think you will continue to see seizures going up.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if I can give you an exact number.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At an increased rate because of all the --<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 When the resources are in place, I think you will see that.\xc2\xa0 And I think you will see crime rates along the border keep -- either remain stable or keep going down, so that communities along the border are safer because of this money.\xc2\xa0 So there are all kinds of ways you could look at it, but I would look at all of those factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the earlier questions about the timing of comprehensive reform.\xc2\xa0 So is it safe to say now that the policy pieces are in place -- I know you say it\xe2\x80\x99s not sequential -- but the policy pieces are being put in place, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s simply a political problem to get reform through Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to say that it is time for immigration reform; that the administration is ready to invite the Congress to get at it.\xc2\xa0 But again, as Gibbs just said, it can\'t be just one party; the Republican leadership now needs to come to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, Republicans here in Washington and in the region say that while this is -- while 1,200 National Guard troops is helpful and while this money is helpful, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere near enough.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that more is needed, or do you think that we really have the resources you need at this point to do the job?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think this bill matches very well with what the President asked for in June.\xc2\xa0 It augments what we had already been surging down the border, beginning in March of \xe2\x80\x9909.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think people perhaps didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the fact that since March of \xe2\x80\x9909 we have been moving resources to the Southwest border. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows us to make some of those resources permanent, not temporary.\xc2\xa0 So I believe that we have designed what needs to happen at this border, we have a good idea what it takes to keep this border safe and secure, and that these monies will allow us to do that.\xc2\xa0 And again, it shows when the Congress acts in a bipartisan fashion, even on a complicated issue -- and border security is a complicated issue; other issues they\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed in a bipartisan fashion are complicated -- when they do it things can move rather swiftly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand for sure how you\'re responding to my specific question. Do you think this is enough, or is more needed to do the job that you think needs to be done?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think this is what we asked for, and of course, what we asked for is what we thought would be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how long it takes for 1,500 more agents to be hired and trained and get on the job?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the average time for a Border Patrol agent to go from hiring to training to be boots on the ground is eight months.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eight months?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Is eight months.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And once you get all of these in place, you feel you have kind of a long-term now stabilization on the numbers there. Is the gap widening between the border security and then the more political issue on the other side of what to do with the illegal aliens who are in the United States now?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a problem that now is even farther -- especially with the lawsuits that are out there -- is that becoming farther and farther from a possibility, not only this year but next?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that goes to the issue of underlying immigration reform with those already in the country.\xc2\xa0 But we have set pretty clear priorities for ICE about who they should focus on from a law enforcement perspective, just like any prosecution office would.\xc2\xa0 And we have directed, and the assistant secretary has directed, that we focus on criminal aliens -- and record numbers are being removed from our country of criminal aliens; that we focus on gang members; that we focus on felony fugitives.\xc2\xa0 And when you look at the numbers, the numbers show that ICE has made significant strides in that regard and, really, record numbers are being removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, as far as this bill President signed this morning, it\xe2\x80\x99s supported by the Indian Americans and companies doing business in India.\xc2\xa0 But there is a red alert in India now from some companies doing business in India in the part of the bill, which is that this bill will be paid by those H1B visa holders who will be entering the U.S., but they have not entered yet, but it will be paid by them.\xc2\xa0 And also that this bill might impact the U.S.-India relations, and what many companies are saying this bill should be paid by those who are illegal in this country but not those people doing business in India.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the method of payment, which is an increased visa charge for certain business-related<br/>\nbusinesses -- business-related visas -- makes a lot of sense, because what it\xe2\x80\x99s saying is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that we pay for immigration in this part of it, that we pay for it out of the visa system.\xc2\xa0 And that way it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of the general fund, which is necessary for so many other things.\xc2\xa0 And so the Senate was able to find a way to fund this bill that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add to the deficit and allows us to get the enforcement monies we need on a permanent basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that in any way as far as U.S.-India relations and this connection and the companies doing business in India?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think this administration has a very close relationship with India and we hope to sustain it as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the issue of comprehensive immigration reform. There is a concern about the temporary worker program as you were starting -- this precursor that -- Marc Morial, for instance, the head of the National Urban League, is concerned that there needs to be more accountability in the process of screenings just in case there are companies that decide that they may need to go outside of the United States to bring in some workers.\xc2\xa0 What say you about that and bringing in more accountability as to finding -- making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99ve exhausted all avenues that no one wants to work in that company, and they have to go abroad to Mexico?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are all concerned and focused on making sure in the business side of the immigration process that the rules are followed, that the rules are enforced, and that jobs are not unfairly precluded for American workers. And that\'s the directive that\'s gone out.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would -- it might be the directive, but what kind of teeth are you putting in place? What kind of accountability efforts are you putting in place to make sure that businesses are exhausting every measure that they can to make sure that no one wants the job in the United States before they go out into Mexico for hiring?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 We can give you a separate briefing, but at USCIS, they have begun or have been conducting a lot of oversight or go-backs on visas that are given, to make sure that the rules are being followed.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lindsay Graham had been specifically working on this issue.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about the need for Republicans to come to the table.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration specifically reaching out to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think the administration has reached out to a number of Republicans, including Senator Graham. And I think we all recognize that this is an issue that\'s not going to go away; that immigration needs to be addressed even as we secure the border.\xc2\xa0 And so, yes, the administration has reached out to Republican leadership and to others, including Senator Graham.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has he indicated that he will be willing to work with you on something?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, he co-signed a op-ed with Senator Schumer, and they, together, because of where they sit in the Judiciary Committee structure, have key roles to play on whether an immigration bill could move through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And that op-ed, which the President has endorsed, laid out really what the framework for the immigration bill should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was a while ago, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean more recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have seen no sign that there is any change in Senator Graham\xe2\x80\x99s position.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano, last week after a nun was killed in a drunk driving accident in Prince William County, you asked for a review into the circumstances that led the alleged driver to be released by ICE back in 2008. Just looking for some details there:\xc2\xa0 When do you expect that review be completed?\xc2\xa0 Will the results be public?\xc2\xa0 And what questions are you hoping it will answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 The review is not complete yet.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a completion date, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re tracking out of our headquarters.\xc2\xa0 I think we want to know the same thing that the public wants to know.\xc2\xa0 Why was this individual with two DUIs in his past out on the road?\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that the directives that we have issued since this individual entered the immigration system, that the directives would make sure that somebody like this would not be released onto the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will those results be made public, or is this just for internal --<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Let me not answer that question prematurely because I don\'t know whether there is a -- whether that would compromise an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 But to the extent we can make things public, we absolutely want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Madam Secretary.\xc2\xa0 A number of Republicans, notably on the House side, have indicated they would be warmer toward a comprehensive immigration package if there was more being done on the fence.\xc2\xa0 Was more money put in for the fence along the border, and what is its status right now?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 The fence -- there is not money in here specifically for fence, in this supplemental.\xc2\xa0 But we have built out the fence to the extent, minus about six miles, that it has received appropriations.\xc2\xa0 And so, in our view, the fence is there.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the fence is only part of this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as I said, I think famously, when I was a governor, you show me a 15-foot fence and I\'ll show you a 16-foot ladder.\xc2\xa0 You got to have infrastructure but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have the manpower and technology to back it up.\xc2\xa0 And you got to have the air cover.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really the system that we have been putting in place over the last 18 months, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s in this bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the fence is just six miles short of completion?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 From the amount that was appropriated for the fence, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 And I think that six miles have -- I may be corrected, but I believe almost all of that is in litigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the money in the bill for incarceration and prosecution.\xc2\xa0 But is that record deportation of criminal immigrants -- was that straining your existing resources?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, yes, it was.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things about this bill that\xe2\x80\x99s significant is that it recognizes that this is a system, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a system that crosses federal departments.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to increase efforts on border security, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to increase efforts on removing and deporting criminal aliens and the like, you need more on the detention side, you need more on the immigration judge side, you need more on the U.S. attorneys side.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s $196 million in here for the Justice Department.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano, could I ask you to weigh in on the 14th Amendment controversy before Congress right now?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s remotely practicable to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, deport babies -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- what do you make, from an immigration perspective and a policy perspective, about this \xe2\x80\x9cborn in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and discussion about whether you should no longer be a citizen?\xc2\xa0 Are you surprised that Senator Graham and some of the other senators who have intimated they wanted to debate this issue have gone there?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I have to tell you I am surprised, to say the least, that discussion is being had about amending the United States Constitution before we even get to the table on amending the statutes that actually carry out immigration policy. I think that\'s where the action needs to be.\xc2\xa0 And any talk of amending the Constitution is just wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you say it\xe2\x80\x99s political also, or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s serious --<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- I just wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that with the President and do you have a sense of his feelings on it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Sheryl, I think I spoke on this two days ago, after having discussed this with the President.\xc2\xa0 And what I said was I very much -- the President and Secretary Napolitano agree on this.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take this a couple different ways.\xc2\xa0 The 14th Amendment enshrines, and has for more than 150 years, equal protection and due process -- two things that we don\'t think need to be tampered with.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary just pointed out the process for augmenting the Constitution takes a long time.\xc2\xa0 With a little leadership, we could have comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And it is always interesting that -- and I said this the other day and I will say it one more time -- that those that have, with steadfast fidelity, talked about not tampering with our Constitution have now swerved to pick the 14th Amendment as the best place to address comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s rich in its irony; it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong in its approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Brewer, in justifying the state\xe2\x80\x99s immigration law, has repeatedly said that the federal government is not doing its job.\xc2\xa0 Do you see this legislation, in part, as an answer to that criticism?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m also wondering if you can talk about what conversations -- we know she met with the President earlier this year -- that you have had with her, your successor?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it in two ways.\xc2\xa0 One is I think her factual premise was just wrong.\xc2\xa0 The facts are the facts.\xc2\xa0 And the facts are that there are more Border Patrol agents at that border than ever before; there\xe2\x80\x99s more infrastructure at the border than ever before; there\xe2\x80\x99s more technology at the border than ever before; there\xe2\x80\x99s more air cover at the border than ever before.\xc2\xa0 And the results are the results. The results are that illegal crossings are way down, and seizures of drugs and guns and cash are way up.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I think that the factual premise that she posited, which is that somehow the federal government had ignored Arizona, was just inaccurate -- and unfairly so.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to augment the resources that we have been putting into Arizona, particularly the East side of the state, which is known as the Tucson sector.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, when I was the U.S. attorney, I supervised the prosecution of at least 6,000 immigration felonies.\xc2\xa0 This is an area I know quite well.\xc2\xa0 And I will tell you there has never been a greater federal presence at this border.\xc2\xa0 So the factual premise for the bill was wrong.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I did meet with Governor Brewer in Boston during the NGA, and we just discussed all the things that we were doing at the Arizona border.\xc2\xa0 It was a very professional and cordial conversation. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, the Republicans along the way have said that you have to secure the border first.\xc2\xa0 You, yourself, have listed a number of steps that the administration has taken during the past 18 months.\xc2\xa0 My question to you is, first of all, how will the administration respond?\xc2\xa0 Because there are already Republicans saying that this is an important first step, but more has to be done.\xc2\xa0 The question is, when will the border be secure? Who will certify that the border is secure if that is what is needed to get comprehensive immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is more than a first step.\xc2\xa0 I go back to March of 2009, when we began moving assets and resources down into the Southwest border, so I disagree with that characteristic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, this is a great bill for us.\xc2\xa0 This is a great bill.\xc2\xa0 It adds a thousand Border Patrol agents; it adds ICE agents; it adds air cover; it adds other technology. It helps us make sure we have the most up-to-date communications technology at the border, which is really important because some areas you can\xe2\x80\x99t cover with a cell phone because there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any cell towers down there, so you really need the communications capacity. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that part is there.\xc2\xa0 And what I would simply say is -- sometimes I hear \xe2\x80\x9csecuring the border\xe2\x80\x9d and the goalpost just keeps moving -- \xe2\x80\x9cwell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done this, we need to do this and this and this.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I say, look, we will continue to do everything we need to do to have a safe and secure Southwest border.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to do everything we need to do to work with counties along that border. We now have the Secure Community System, as I said before, at every one of the 25 counties along the border.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to make sure that our efforts are informed by good intelligence and analysis so we\xe2\x80\x99re not just throwing money at the border.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that should not be used anymore to preclude discussions about immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 As I said many times, these should not be sequential; they should go together.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A second question, Madam Secretary.\xc2\xa0 ICE has said that they can only get only get to (inaudible) deportations a year because they just don\'t have more resources.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if this bill would provide some more resources to get some more deportations.\xc2\xa0 And the second point is, some activists have said that by passing this bill alone the most radical have hijacked the debate on comprehensive immigration reform, and I would like your reaction on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is likely that we will see more deportations, particularly in the priority categories I have set forth.\xc2\xa0 Can I give you a number just yet?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 It would be premature to do so.\xc2\xa0 But obviously our goal is to make the best, most efficient use of the money that we receive from the Congress, and focus it on where we think the best efforts ought to be.\xc2\xa0 And that is making sure we are removing from our country criminal aliens, felony fugitives, gang members who are also in our country illegally, particularly once they\'ve served their sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who say, or who would suggest that somehow this bill is radical -- what did you say -- what was the phrase you used?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They say that by passing this bill alone, the radicals have hijacked the debate, basically, and moving to more enforcement-type --<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just wrong.\xc2\xa0 I think this bill is a bill that the President asked for.\xc2\xa0 He asked for it because we know that we can make good use of these monies for permanent and consistent across-the-border security, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to have.\xc2\xa0 But that in no way should be read to suggest, imply, or in any way, back off from the fact that we also need immigration reform.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary, Senator McCain and Senator Kyl said yesterday that key elements of border security are still missing, for example, implementation of Operation Streamline in the Tucson sector, more Border Patrol agents, among other things.\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering if -- do you agree with this statement?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that these kind of measures are still needed in the border? <br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Operation Streamline has proven effective in some places where it is used.\xc2\xa0 We use it in some places.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very expensive, and there are other methods that we use that are proven equally effective.\xc2\xa0 And so as you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make the best use of taxpayer dollars and make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re targeted where they can do the best -- Streamline is one way. Repatriation into the interior of Mexico is another way that has proven very effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so we need a lot of different kinds of tools in our toolbox.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a mistake to focus on any single one and say, well, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that tool, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have an effective system.\xc2\xa0 We have a good toolbox.\xc2\xa0 We have a good system.\xc2\xa0 And now with these monies, again, passed with the support of Senator McCain and Kyl, we can do even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up, a quick follow-up?\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, you said that leadership is needed from the Republicans and Democrats in Congress in order to have comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But in Congress they said that leadership in the White House is needed in order to have comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So at the end of the day --<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Look, only Congress can pass a bill. The President can advocate, he can get them to the table, as he has in the Roosevelt Room upstairs.\xc2\xa0 He can implore, he can provide ideas, he can agree to a framework, as he already has.\xc2\xa0 He can give a major address that spells out what\xe2\x80\x99s needed in a bill.\xc2\xa0 But only Congress can pass a bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Take one more in the very back.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Businesses from India and the U.S. have said that the portion of the bill which raises the fee on H1 and L1 visa is discriminatory and this would undermine the growing economic relations between India and the U.S.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your comment on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it will.\xc2\xa0 I think the United States and India have a robust and vital relationship, and nothing in this bill should interfere with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, about the WTO scenario where the U.S. can be taken to -- the WTO rules are being violated with this bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 On that I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment.\xc2\xa0 That has not been raised to me at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Madam Secretary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Should we do a few other topics, and then call it a Friday?<br/>\n<br/>\nBen and then I\'ll go to April.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A couple quick topics.\xc2\xa0 Down in the Gulf today could be the day that the well is sealed for good, depending on, I guess, test results there.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any indication on how that\'s going?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say -- and I think we will have directives from the National Incident Commander soon -- the scientific team met and was meeting this morning, as they have in each big step along the way, to evaluate where we were, take pressure readings, evaluate all the data that\'s applicable in making those next decisions.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you know, the storm delayed some of the activity on the relief well.\xc2\xa0 It is our hope that, even as we have put the mud into the well-bore and cemented the well, that the final steps that will kill this well off once and for all will resume soon and hopefully come to fruition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99d be nice to have that sometime this weekend. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It would be nice to -- well -- (laughter) -- no, no, it would be nice to have had that about 110 days ago, but I say that not because of the proximity of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0 I say that because we have maintained throughout this process that that was the end of this well, is having that relief well and have -- what that means in terms of the stability of the entire well structure -- that is obviously important to moving forward.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this -- and I repeat this because it is important to this government and to this President. This would end -- a relief well -- a successful relief well would end this phase of, but would not end our commitment to this region.\xc2\xa0 We still have oil to clean up.\xc2\xa0 We still have an environment to monitor and measure and study.\xc2\xa0 We have natural resource damage assessments that will be -- fines that will be given to BP for that.\xc2\xa0 And we have a process by which restoration of the Gulf will begin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecretary Mabus will travel with the President tomorrow to Florida, and they will talk more about that process.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talk more about the restoration process?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Talk more about sort of what these -- what sort of we\'re shifting into in terms of the next steps in this process.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important that the people in the region understand and know clearly that -- our focus has been for the past many days what we think is now very much upon us, and that is a well that is dead.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important to know that this well has not leaked oil for a month.\xc2\xa0 That is important -- certainly important to the environment and to the people of the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 This well, the relief well would kill this once and for all.\xc2\xa0 That ends that phase as we transition to the next phase.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other point, moving a little bit further ahead -- can you frame White House goals and expectations for the President\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. trip next week?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s going all over the place.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a lot of political fundraisers to that, but he\xe2\x80\x99s got a policy event every day.\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to get out of this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk a lot about the economy, different aspects of it, in different places, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our initiative on exports and other things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel includes, as you mentioned, Ben, a hefty amount of political travel for Senate candidates, for gubernatorial candidates, and for the congressional committee.\xc2\xa0 And some of the money raised goes directly to state parties to build campaigns, strong campaign, top to bottom, within the state in some very important areas in 2010.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the President takes that role seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously are getting closer and closer to some very important elections where we\'ll make some important choices about going backwards or going forwards.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear that speech again. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To clarify, it sounds like you\'re not willing to give up on the relief wells.\xc2\xa0 Just leaving the cemented top as it is now is not enough for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hesitate to get ahead of what I think the National Incident Commander is going to do soon.\xc2\xa0 Again, the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve always talked about this is the importance of that relief well.\xc2\xa0 Despite the fact that if you -- look, a month ago, a sealing cap largely prevented additional oil from coming out.\xc2\xa0 Mud on top of that increased that.\xc2\xa0 The cementing of that increased that.\xc2\xa0 But we still have the relief well. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you ever go back in and find out what went wrong in the first place?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got all these oil wells out there that can\xe2\x80\x99t budge until you guys find out what happened --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a scientific and engineering process that is ongoing that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I forget the exact name of it but I\'ll get it -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s headlined out of New Orleans, that will look at -- and, look, I think one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to do is look at some of the components that are there and see the degree to which they contributed to what happened on April 20th.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President discouraged at all at the stubborn nature of the economic recovery?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, has been for going on 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what else -- I mean, everything is being thrown at it.\xc2\xa0 You hear about creating more opportunities for small businesses, creating more jobs --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which I think is -- which, I will tell you, is a priority of the President and what he hopes is a priority that the Senate will complete when it comes back to do its business in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hear a lot about how important small business is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s true; how important small business is to creating jobs -- that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 What we need now is that rhetoric to match the support of Republicans on Capitol Hill that, for the most part, have voted against -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- ending capital gains for small business, increasing the amount that small businesses can deduct based on the investments that they make, and increasing through community banks the lending that\xe2\x80\x99s available for credit to expand and hire more workers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 I think what happened just earlier this week, ensuring that 160,000 teachers and 160,000 classrooms weren\xe2\x80\x99t without those teachers was tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 I have said this millions of times and I\'ll make it a million and one.\xc2\xa0 We looked at and we continue to face the greatest economic downturn that our country has seen since the Great Depression in almost every person\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime.\xc2\xa0 It is going to take a while to get out of that hole.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work at finding whatever solutions are necessary for trying to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you look at -- and I know this is -- the President understands the frustration that the millions without jobs face.\xc2\xa0 What is economically indisputable is that the actions that were taken prevented something much, much, much worse from coming to fruition.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will it take to restore the confidence, though, in the American people who -- in the spring, when we were talking to people, you got the sense that everyone thought things were getting better.\xc2\xa0 Now, polling, it seems that people think otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said here the other day, I think the trajectory of where April and August are, are different. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what we\xe2\x80\x99re not debating is whether that trajectory is up or down, okay?\xc2\xa0 If you look at where we were a year ago, if you look at where we were a year and a half ago, we were fighting an economy that was contracting greatly, we were fighting an economy that was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs --\xc2\xa0 700,000, 750,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re adding jobs.\xc2\xa0 Our economy is growing.\xc2\xa0 Not as fast as the President and many of those that are frustrated would want -- and I would include the President among those that is frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously some events happened, I think beginning, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President and myself say, beginning in Greece and in Europe, that have caused people to become concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip this weekend -- this was asked a couple of days ago -- but any plans to get in the water?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt that that will go out specifically on the guidance, but stay tuned.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everyone wants the picture, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What this is about is that everyone wants the photograph.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you guys bringing your suits?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you -- go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes, right?\xc2\xa0 It just won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the guidance?\xc2\xa0 If I were going -- I would bring my suit if I were going, but I\'m not going.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not -- well.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Give your Speedo to somebody else.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the question is, will we get in the water, and will there be pictures?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will wait --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the waters clean enough to get into?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course they\xe2\x80\x99re clean enough to get into.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that say something if he takes a walk down the beach but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put his feet in the water?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Guys, why don\'t we all worry about what happens on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because this is Friday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday and we have to preview whether or not the President will go swimming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let -- <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest tourism --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Swim -- we\'re not saying swimming.\xc2\xa0 He can just walk in the water.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I see, just walking in the water.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, above the knees.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, you guys maybe get together, figure out -- (laughter) -- what would appropriately check the Aquaman box and -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you would say it now, it\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest tourism --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a non-swimming question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Was the President briefed about GM\xe2\x80\x99s news yesterday?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did he react?\xc2\xa0 And when, with an IPO likely in the coming months, does he expect to get back the government\xe2\x80\x99s money?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I want to state clearly, I am not, and you have heard on any number of occasions, members of this administration, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to comment on an IPO. Obviously that is a process that is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Once that process begins, the Securities and the Exchange Commission has purview over that process, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to run afoul of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe President -- obviously we are grateful for and I think the country should be grateful for the service and the sacrifice of Ed Whitacre.\xc2\xa0 The President was informed of this, and our belief is that Dan Akerson is a proven and well-respected individual that will carry on what Ed and others have started in restructuring an auto company that not too long ago was on the brink of extinction.\xc2\xa0 They announced again yesterday a quarterly profit.\xc2\xa0 They are on the upswing, as the other auto companies are, as well.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President and the administration say -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this not necessarily in the relation to the timing of IPOs -- but our belief is that if you look at the valuation of the company and the investment that we put in, we believe the money that this administration put in will be gotten back.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think the reason is -- and I think this is important\xc2\xa0 -- the money that we invested came with managerial changes that had to be enacted.\xc2\xa0 I think Ed Whitacre and I think Dan Akerson understand that GM made a series of decisions that got them into a position, with the type of economic downturn that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, that, quite frankly, put the existence of the company in great danger.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI think both of those individuals -- and I think you have a management structure and work ethic at that company in management -- and we all saw the tremendous job that those that are working each day putting those new cars together -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an understanding that they have a second chance; that that investment required them to do some things differently, and they are, and now there\xe2\x80\x99s a much different story to tell in the auto world, that will only, quite frankly, get better as our economy gets stronger, and more people buy cars.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say these figures before -- the auto industry\xe2\x80\x99s sort of apex was 17 million to 17.5 million car sales a year. The economy that we were dealing with when the President came into office was one that was selling at 9-9.5 million cars a year.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re up to 11-11.5 million cars a year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get higher and higher, and the industry itself will get, by definition, stronger and stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that, Robert?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel like his philosophy on governance has been vindicated by this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think his philosophy that a million people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose their jobs without us taking -- without us doing what is necessary to keep them, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy that communities that are built around and generations of families that are built around work in the auto industry shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be abandoned without a fighting chance I think has proven to be correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe President would be, though, the first to tell you that management decisions that were made, as I just talked about, to change the direction and trajectory of the auto industry were important.\xc2\xa0 And everybody made sacrifices -- most of all, the workers, as they did what they thought they needed to do to keep an industry in place.\xc2\xa0 They owe -- they are owed a lot of credit for what has happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nChip.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you familiar with the Benenson memo?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Benenson memo -- I don\'t know what the memo is.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or maybe you could just address the argument, basically it\xe2\x80\x99s that this is not going to be a wave election because the Republicans are even less popular than the Democrats are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say -- my sense is Joel\xe2\x80\x99s memo is sitting somewhere in my in-box.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen Joel\xe2\x80\x99s memo.\xc2\xa0 I will say if you just look at -- if you look at the NBC poll, you see that the drop in ratings for Republicans is greater than any other political party.\xc2\xa0 They continue to be less popular than Democrats. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you look at that polling, you see a fairly appreciable change in the enthusiasm gap over the course of several months.\xc2\xa0 I think quite honestly the President has pointed out to the American people and others what those choices are:\xc2\xa0 Are we going to take an economic philosophy that got us into this mess and go back to that, or an economic philosophy that is getting out of it?\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what the next several months of this election will be about, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll do well in November.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That, along with the recent election, does the White House, does the President feel Democrats are on a little bit of a roll right now? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said, Chip, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- what is -- undoubtedly, Democrats had a very good Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 In every state we nominated the strongest candidates, and in many of those races got opponents that I think most people believe make the chances of Republicans winning many of those races less likely. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, does the President see this as a family vacation, and can you really have a family vacation in 27 hours?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President views this as -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it originally billed as a vacation?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think this was originally billed as, and continues to be billed as, highlighting the notion that a region of the country that is heavily dependent upon tourism is alive, well, and open for business.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a number of these communities, certainly those closer to Louisiana and Mississippi and in Alabama, for a lot of these communities, you talk to folks there, and this was to be the first season, past Katrina and Rita and other natural disasters, that things would have been back to normal for the entire time.\xc2\xa0 And we know that well down the coast of Florida, communities that never saw oil are being impacted economically.\xc2\xa0 Tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast is the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an opportunity to highlight the notion that this important region of the country is still doing well and open for business.\xc2\xa0 It will also provide the President an opportunity to, again, talk to those that have been affected by the damage caused by BP, and a desire to talk again with them about what has to happen going forward to restore, both economically and environmentally, the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been done.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not a vacation?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have some fun.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not he gets in the water is up for clearly some debate.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But, look, he will have an opportunity to enjoy the physical beauty of the Gulf and do some work at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This evening the President is hosting an Iftaar dinner in honor of Ramadan, in celebration of Ramadan.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been monitoring closely the U.S.-allies coordinated efforts in the Pakistani-Gulf relief efforts, Robert?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously the President has, in his PDB, been briefed on the flooding that has occurred in Pakistan and asked that -- asked each day specifically about the relief efforts there and to ensure that all that can be done is being done to assist the Pakistanis in what clearly is a devastating environment with devastating pictures.*<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow on the Ramadan?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reaction to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that it is fueling the nuclear power plant in Iran at Bushehr?\xc2\xa0 Did we ask them recently not to do this?\xc2\xa0 I presumed we\xe2\x80\x99ve maintained all along that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to do this until --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think this is -- I think what is important here is this is done under IAEA -- under the monitoring and the safeguards of the IAEA.\xc2\xa0 Russia is providing for the fuel and taking the spent fuel back out of the country.\xc2\xa0 It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think, in many ways, this is a concept that closes that fuel loop, and I think, again, demonstrates and proves to the world that if the Iranians are sincere in a peaceful program, their needs can be met without undertaking its own enrichment program, which call into question its motives.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I ask a follow-up?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter, WikiLeaks says it\xe2\x80\x99s going to release about half of the 15,000 documents it withheld because of its admitted concern about their sensitivity initially.\xc2\xa0 Does this trouble you more than the initial release?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it would be easy to quantify the troubling nature of the initial releases with this release as well.\xc2\xa0 I think all of the releases have been troubling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe discussed the nature of what\xe2\x80\x99s in these documents, why there are laws in place to ensure that documents that are classified as secret and top secret aren\xe2\x80\x99t posted on the Internet. It\xe2\x80\x99s the safety and the security of our soldiers.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you go back to the beginning of -- or go back to the initial release of documents and find what the spokesman for the Taliban said specifically about names that they found in those documents, that they knew how to deal with those individuals.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re clear on what that means.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re clear on the danger that those that are helping an effort to provide safety and security and peace to the Afghans, how that is threatened by those who wish to do us harm and those who wish to continue to garner attention for themselves by posting these documents on the Internet. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can ask one final question.\xc2\xa0 Norm Eisen\xe2\x80\x99s departure and the decision to basically chop up his responsibilities among other officials and not name another ethics czar -- why should that not be seen as a lessening in commitment --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who came up with the notion of the \xe2\x80\x9cethics czar.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we like the czar.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched your channel; I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d writ large.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those 37 stories, Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not just us.\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be seen as a lessened commitment to transparency and accountability?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of attorneys in the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office and an added position in the Domestic Policy Council to oversee our efforts to reform the way our government works and to ensure its highest ethical standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand, though, Wendell, that charge does not come from a participant in the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office or a staffer at the DPC.\xc2\xa0 It comes from the President of the United States -- a President who, as a state senator in Illinois, worked to change laws in that state that allowed at one point you to use your campaign fund to buy a car not for campaign purposes but just to drive around; somebody who worked in the U.S. Senate to pass landmark ethics reform in 2007, and has instituted here some of the toughest rules on closing the revolving door and ensuring that the people of this country know each and every month who comes in to meet with people and who they meet with.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To clarify Ann\xe2\x80\x99s earlier question on top kill versus static kill, Admiral Allen said yesterday -- I believe it was yesterday in a briefing -- that there was a possibility that there was more harm than good in trying to go for the relief well.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve noted here today that all along you guys have said that the relief well is the final end-all.\xc2\xa0 I\'d just like a little clarification on that.\xc2\xa0 Are you intimating that you will go ahead with the relief well?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The powers vested in me are not the same as those at the National Incident Command.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let them make the final announcements on that.\xc2\xa0 I think what Admiral Allen might have -- I did not see what he specifically said that you just talked about.\xc2\xa0 There has been -- and I said this earlier -- at each of the big points along the way, before different operations -- static kill, top kill, the sealing cap, what have you -- have taken place, there has been a robust and vigorous discussion with the scientific team, largely headed by Secretary Chu, to evaluate each of the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.\xc2\xa0 Because obviously doing no harm to the situation that we have now is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 So I know that there were meetings going on today to evaluate a whole range of scientific data around the well, the integrity of the well, and a whole host of features.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not implying here today the relief well will definitely be drilled?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want to not simply imply, but state clearly that that direction will come from the National Incident Command.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I talk a little --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just one more, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 The symbolic nature of the trip to the Gulf -- there was some criticism when the First Family went to Maine after the First Lady had encouraged others to go to Panama City.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the picture, the symbolic nature of why they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be there?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that for anybody -- look, I grew up not far from there.\xc2\xa0 I have friends that are vacationing in the Gulf right now.\xc2\xa0 That region of our country is so heavily dependent upon visitors from throughout the region and throughout the country for the nature of their economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what fills those hotels.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what fills those restaurants.\xc2\xa0 And what the President wants to do is highlight the health of the region, the vitality of the region, that it\xe2\x80\x99s open for business, and that we hope others will do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for anyone not to go to the Gulf.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for anybody not to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the dinner tonight, do you anticipate that the President will address the issue of the mosque in New York?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the President\xe2\x80\x99s final remarks, Laura.\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President strongly believes that our country was founded on, first and foremost, on a tenet of religious freedom.\xc2\xa0 We have events throughout the year -- Christmas, Hanukkah, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s event, Iftaar, and others -- to celebrate the rich diversity of religious freedom in this country that goes back, as I said, to its founding.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I have not seen the final remarks. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that square, though, with the earlier comments on this from the White House that this is a local matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Religious freedom is something that the President believes in and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on Bushehr reactor, in March, when Secretary Clinton was in Russia, she said that it would be premature to open the plant until Iran had given the international community reassurances that its nuclear program was only for civil and peaceful purposes.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s changed?\xc2\xa0 You seem to be endorsing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you over to State.\xc2\xa0 I think they can answer the difference on where we are today.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, is the fact that the President\xe2\x80\x99s water visit is in question because possibly about Secret Service and security getting in the water with him?\xc2\xa0 Is that some of the issue?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a real issue, because he said something about like that in Hawaii.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, April, I got to tell you, you will never see me stand up here and talk about security issues, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to this question or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, one more question, one more -- <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You ended with a big one, and -- go ahead, go with your follow-up.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the Katrina anniversary.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is New Orleans now like another American city, especially since this administration has pulled it out of its standalone status, in the ways that you look at it? We understand that you have lumped New Orleans in with other cities that are -- that just have the normal financial issues and things of that nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is -- looking at findings --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- before you rephrase your question.\xc2\xa0 The region that was impacted so devastatingly by Katrina, I want to assure you this administration does not look at like it looks at everything.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be honest with you, April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could look at the actions, the funding that we\xe2\x80\x99ve freed up, the stuff that has been done by Secretary Donovan on housing, the reforms that have been helped and moved along by Secretary Duncan in education -- I think the premise of your question, the notion that somehow we\xe2\x80\x99ve turned a blind eye to treat that -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re shaking your head, but I\'m going to take this for a little bit of a ride -- I just don\'t think the premise of your question is accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s not special, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have its needs.\xc2\xa0 What I was saying -- and let me rephrase it -- is that some OMB officials came over earlier -- around -- just right after the release of the FY2011 budget. And we asked about New Orleans, and they said New Orleans is now, by this administration, viewed in light -- like Detroit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in a category -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not standalone anymore but it\xe2\x80\x99s in another category of a special-needs kind of -- still moving forward.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be honest with you, April.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bill the President signed to reduce the disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is not retroactive, so those who were serving -- or offenders that were serving before he signed the bill will be serving longer sentences than people in the future.\xc2\xa0 Has he thought about reducing those sentences, or has anyone looked at this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question that I will ask somebody about.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that Axelrod met yesterday with Elizabeth Warren.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you make of that?\xc2\xa0 Were they talking about the appointment?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They were discussing whether we were going to go swimming in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Walk on the water or --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I tried the best I could not to laugh as I was doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, look, obviously she was here.\xc2\xa0 I think it -- look, the consumer office is an aspect of the financial reform/Wall Street reform bill that the President signed recently.\xc2\xa0 It is -- it in many ways was an idea conceptualized by Elizabeth Warren several years ago.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have said that she is among those being looked at for a role in that new bureau, because the President believes that -- if you think about the intersection that most people have with the financial industry in this country -- it\xe2\x80\x99s getting loans for a house, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting loans for autos, it\xe2\x80\x99s credit cards.\xc2\xa0 The reforms that the President worked on and passed earlier, particularly around credit cards and the protections that he thinks need to happen going forward in loans like the ones I talked about, are a big part of the financial reform bill that he passed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say I do not expect any personnel announcements about this job in the coming week.\xc2\xa0 But she was here to talk about the office yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The week ahead will go out in email in just a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, you said week or weeks for the announcement on the financial --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Week, week. I don\'t anticipate anything next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nEND<br/>\n1:25 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
