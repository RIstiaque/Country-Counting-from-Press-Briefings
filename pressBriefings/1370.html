b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>*The audience (approx. 700)for the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech at Cooper Union tomorrow will include leaders from the financial industry, members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, consumer advocates, representatives of the millions of people impacted by the downturn of the economy, local elected officials and Cooper Union students and faculty.</p>\n<p>** Yesterday while aboard Air Force One, the President called Senators Brown, Lugar, LeMieux, Murkowski and Gregg to discuss immigration reform.</p>\n<p>12:09 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before I take questions, I just want to call your attention to -- obviously you all have seen the news today that GM is paying back $4.7 of the $6.7 billion loan via TARP to it.\xc2\xa0 The White House has issued a report that should be -- if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in your inbox, it will be out momentarily.</p>\n<p>I just want to call to a few -- some of the highlights of the report that looks back at the decision that the administration made relating to the American auto industry about a year ago.\xc2\xa0 Some highlights:\xc2\xa0 In the 12 months before the President took office, the auto industry lost nearly 40 percent of its sales volume and over 40 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, lost over 400,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 Today employment in the auto industry has stabilized.\xc2\xa0 Since GM exited bankruptcy in early July 2009, the industry has added 45,000 jobs.</p>\n<p>The President undertook the decision to loan money to GM and Chrysler for several reasons, not the least of which was the economic impact of their bankruptcy, estimated by the former Treasury Department to be as many as 1.1 million jobs; some economists had assumed that it could be on the order of magnitude of 2.5 to 3 million jobs lost in both direct auto jobs as well as spinoff parts supplier jobs that could have been affected.</p>\n<p>As you know, the President also insisted on, for those loans, a restructuring of past bad company decisions had to be reconciled.\xc2\xa0 The good news about today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement from General Motors is that it is repaying its loan five years ahead of schedule, which, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re not out of the woods, but I think demonstrates the path that General Motors is on.\xc2\xa0 Chrysler announced its earnings today, and despite losing money from the time that it exited bankruptcy last year to the end of the year lost money, part of which was a one-time restructuring charge, it achieved an operating profit in the first quarter of 2010, the first quarterly operating profit since the beginning of the economic crisis.</p>\n<p>Again -- and I would say one other thing, that the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s program on lending facilities freed up the credit market as it related to auto loans last year.\xc2\xa0 We all remember back to a point in which even individuals with good credit couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the ability to get an auto loan.</p>\n<p>So I would say all of those things are highlighted in the report.\xc2\xa0 The last thing -- 12 months ago auto sales were at their lowest point since 1970.\xc2\xa0 Average annualized sales in the first quarter of 2009 were approximately 9.5 million units.\xc2\xa0 Today U.S. sales have begun to rebound with annualized sales of 11.8 million vehicles in March.\xc2\xa0 Analysts are currently forecasting 2010 sales to be 11.5 to 12 million units.</p>\n<p>So, again, you all should in your inboxes have that report; if not, it will be in there momentarily.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you making the announcement on GM in order to make the case that the administration believes sometimes government bailouts are worthwhile?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m making the case that looking back almost a year later from the President making a very difficult and unpopular decision to loan money to GM and Chrysler in order to go through a structured bankruptcy and save 1 to 3 million jobs, I think we could all agree that the depth of our economic downturn would hardly have been helped with those million or so people additionally out of work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the way that the process was managed, again, allowed -- this was not a loan to continue the type of practices that had led each of the two companies to the brink of bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 It was a loan in order for them to begin to make the tough business decisions in order to restructure for a new time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to do.</p>\n<p>I restate again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination.\xc2\xa0 We have seen improvement.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s testament to a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s hard work and should be noticed.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the meeting on the Supreme Court, Senator Leahy had some criticism of the Court, saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s very partisan, activist, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the American people.\xc2\xa0 He said that he hopes that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee will help change that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President agrees with Senator Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s criticism.\xc2\xa0 And in picking the nomination, is that something that he has in mind?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to look for in a nominee.\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken to the President since the meeting broke up.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you get a sense of he is looking for somebody who has a fidelity to the law, somebody who is independent, and somebody who has the legal stature necessary.\xc2\xa0 I think all of those things the President will, as he said over the next coming weeks, look for in announcing a nominee.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he agree with what Senator Leahy said, that the current court is partisan, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the American people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had a chance to speak with him about what -- if Senator Leahy brought that up in the meeting or if he mentioned it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Leahy has talked about what he sees as the merits of appointing somebody outside the judicial monastery.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?\xc2\xa0 President Clinton also talked about that too.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is -- I think the President has mentioned both in this as we look for a nominee now and as we looked for a nominee last year, somebody who understands how the law affects real people in the real world, not just in a classroom, not just at a school.\xc2\xa0 I think, as was true last time, there are people that will be on this list, some that are judges, some that are not or have been but are not currently judges.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will get an opportunity to look through and select from a broad diversity of experience.</p>\n<p>Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- one of the things that Justice Sotomayor brought, was somebody that had worked in the law at many different avenues, both as somebody who had, as a prosecutor, as a judge, as an advocate and provided a broad swath of different experience.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think that a politician could maybe reflect the real-world experiences better than a judge?\xc2\xa0 Or is he sort of open-minded about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him weigh one versus the other.\xc2\xa0 I think he understands the desire, and certainly the team understands the desire to have a broad group of qualified and talented individuals from which he can select his nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And separately, can you preview the Cooper Union speech at all?\xc2\xa0 And also, can you say who is going to be there in the audience?*</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I will check on the audience stuff after this.\xc2\xa0 I know there were some e-mails on that that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to look through.\xc2\xa0 The President has gone to New York several times to speak on financial reform, twice during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously entering a critical period of time.\xc2\xa0 The House has passed financial reform and the Senate is on the cusp, we hope, of both taking up and moving forward on changing the rules of the road for how banks and our financial system operate.</p>\n<p>So I think he will tomorrow remind the American people what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, what\xe2\x80\x99s important in financial reform.\xc2\xa0 And I know sometimes it can feel -- some of these issues can feel, as the President goes to New York, it can feel disconnected from the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 But obviously financial reform is something that is borne out of an economic collapse that started on Wall Street and spread to Main Street America very quickly.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President will remind the American people and the Senate what we all have at stake as we move forward, and hopefully get something passed out of the Senate and quickly to his desk so that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here many times before, when we get to the second anniversary of the economic collapse we do so with new rules governing how our financial system operates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on that point about the President going to Wall Street, what we can expect in terms of his tone?\xc2\xa0 Various times he\xe2\x80\x99s said if they want to fight, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for a fight.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s called bankers \xe2\x80\x9cfat cats.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But other times he\xe2\x80\x99s said there needs to be a balance and you need to not hurt private enterprise, basically, and he\xe2\x80\x99d be careful.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, look, the President -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think calling out obscene bonuses but also saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to overly or unduly burden private enterprise and American business from operating -- I think, quite frankly, financial reform -- I think that is quite complementary to financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of people, not the least of which are hundreds of millions of Americans who have played by the rules, even as the economy has collapsed around them.</p>\n<p>So I think that the President will -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President over the past not only couple weeks but over the last few years discuss the notion that the reason why we have to have strong rules in place, that those rules are for the benefit of the American people; that we are not incentivizing a set of risky decisions where banks reap all of the reward yet none of the responsibility for the decisions that they make.</p>\n<p>But the President is a strong believer that our financial system is part of a larger system of commerce that we all treasure.\xc2\xa0 We just have to have rules in the road -- rules for the road in place so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves at the mercy of a series of risky decisions as we have in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another quick thing on taxes.\xc2\xa0 Recently, Paul Volcker, one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s leading economic advisors, suggested that the VAT tax is not such a bad idea; that maybe the President should take a look at it.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday Austan Goolsbee was asked about this on a program repeatedly about whether the President would consider a VAT tax and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really directly answer whether --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I directed an answer to this the other day by saying that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that the President had under consideration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since the debt commission is clearly looking at this and many other things --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let -- the debt commission I think meets later in the month, the President will open by speaking to them, and we look forward to their recommendations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The VAT tax would affect people making less than $250,000 a year, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The deficit commission is going to -- is, as you know, comprised of Democrats and Republicans that will come forward with bipartisan recommendations and the President looks forward to those recommendations.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take another crack at Caren\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Is it important to President Obama that there be somebody on the court who\xe2\x80\x99s not from the judiciary; somebody who has experience --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you know, Jake, the President will make a decision on whom that nominee -- whom that next nominee will be.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- again, the reason I used the Sotomayor example is somebody who both had judicial experience but also had legal experience outside of simply rendering judgment on different cases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President is somewhat early in this process and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s not made a final decision on where that all comes down, except I think that it is important that -- for the President that a nominee have a diversity of legal experience, not just as a judge but in different venues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial regulatory reform, would the bill being considered in the Senate or the one that passed the House, would either of them have prevented the alleged fraud that the SEC is currently suing Goldman over?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would direct you to the SEC in where they figure and where they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided their case is.\xc2\xa0 I think not the least of which broader -- in broader terms of financial reform -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take the issue that the President has talked about in terms of derivatives -- bringing that type of activity out of the shadows into an exchange, something that\xe2\x80\x99s monitored and regulated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, I think in many ways as these are complicated -- as the financial system is -- has a series of very complicated instruments, in many ways reform is simple in the premise of having it brought out of the dark and into the light, having the measure of transparency and regulation is a fairly simple concept in moving important reforms forward.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that there are a host of things in the legislation that would have changed people\xe2\x80\x99s behavior from several years ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you -- does the administration have an opinion on those on Wall Street who say that this action you\xe2\x80\x99re proposing with derivatives would cost them hundreds of millions, if not a billion, dollars to take those steps?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think that we have to figure out a way, and the President believes that bringing activities like this out of the dark and into an exchange that\xe2\x80\x99s regulated, is a common-sense step that prevents the potential for a set of risky decisions to be made that no one but taxpayers bear responsibility for.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what animates the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making on this and I think it will animate the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making on passing financial reform.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goldman Sachs has been very kind to Democrats over the years.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard the President or anybody else in the White House express concern that by going after Goldman, the administration is risking losing political contributions not just from them, but from other Wall Street firms with the tone of the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s never been any connection whatsoever, no discussion of it at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Chip, we -- the President visited Wall Street in the middle of September of 2007, when some thought we were on the midst -- we were in the midst of something calamitous about our economy and spoke pretty fervently about the need to change the direction of our regulation.\xc2\xa0 He visited Wall Street again in March of 2008 and has had much to say about Wall Street between now and then.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, again, a pretty tough stance on behalf of taxpayers as it relates to ensuring that risk is not put ahead of common sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard anybody on the fundraising team, for example, argue for toning it down a bit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question on the VAT, correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, but it sounds like Mr. Goolsbee and you are both leaving the door open to the possibility of a VAT down the road.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the commission reports --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great Washington thing to not say something, which means something else.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not prejudging anything the commission does.\xc2\xa0 I think it would -- to get into the hypothetical of prejudging a commission, which is yet to have its first meeting, is sort of a silly thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling it out, not ruling anything out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So on the Supreme Court, can we -- when people talk about the judicial monastery or whatever expression they want to use, they\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was Caren\xe2\x80\x99s term, not mine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually ---</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Patrick Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s term, actually -- and various other people too.\xc2\xa0 But I think we all know what it means -- it\xe2\x80\x99s you don\xe2\x80\x99t want somebody with limited real-world experience.\xc2\xa0 And people have defined that to mean either being a judge or being a law professor.\xc2\xa0 So can we assume that if the President wants somebody with real-world experience, anybody who has spent his entire career as a law professor or a judge is not going to make the list?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of providing the President with extensive information on a number of individuals that I think he will find highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 They will have a diversity of experience.\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to the Sotomayor example as somebody who held positions and different types of employment in many different legal avenues.\xc2\xa0 I think the President wants somebody who understands, as we said in the first instance, that -- understands how law and decisions affect people that live in the real world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President started vetting and talking to potential nominees at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any elucidation there?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Except to say that he has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he spending a lot of time on it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s working on a lot of different things, but obviously this is one of the main priorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President just said when asked about the issue of abortion that he wants somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s interpreting our Constitution in a way that takes into account individual rights, and that includes women\xe2\x80\x99s rights.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it artifice to say that this is not a litmus test?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99d be open, for example, to choosing somebody who didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re playing the Washington game again.\xc2\xa0 If I say this, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in Washington.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, I know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I mean, here\xe2\x80\x99s the question, would he be open to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- I think the fair response is -- I think the fair response is that the President, as you heard him enumerate, is going to look for somebody that shares the notion of legal principles that are enshrined in case law and in the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- again, the President has some familiarity with the Constitution and constitutional law and I think he can, while not having an explicit litmus test, can talk to somebody about a full range of their beliefs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he rules out somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share that belief, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that de facto a litmus test?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the \xe2\x80\x9cif this, does it mean that; if that, does it mean this\xe2\x80\x9d -- I would go with what the President said in terms of understanding the legal principles of our Constitution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the list, I think last week you all were saying that the list was expanding.\xc2\xa0 Is it now contracting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would still consider the process not as one that\xe2\x80\x99s winnowing.\xc2\xa0 Part of it is the team is in the process of getting information to the President on a series of potential nominees that he can look more deeply at.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it turned out that the person he appoints to the court someday provided the fifth vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, would Barack Obama be upset about that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if, after the fact --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate 20-plus-year hypothetical and I just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it could be a two-year hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Or a one-year.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I will -- not wanting to get into hypotheticals, not -- just not getting into 730-day hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 I will -- again, I would point you to what the President said in what he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for in a nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he goes to West Virginia, is he going to be there simply as a mourner, or will he also be talking about accountability of the mine companies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you heard last week in speaking to our mine safety folks, Secretary of Labor, has asked for a full investigation of what happened.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are other agencies in the government that will deal with accountability as to what that investigation shows.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President hopes this weekend, though, is to go and celebrate the lives of those that were lost.\xc2\xa0 I would not expect that the President would use the opportunity to outline a series of policy proposals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously the administration is working through that investigation and working through different aspects of mine safety proposals.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll outline them there.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll find it more appropriate to be mourning the lives of those lost than getting into policy solutions -- again, not to say that that\xe2\x80\x99s not ultimately important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he asked for the investigation and something he\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He won\xe2\x80\x99t be slapping anybody\xe2\x80\x99s wrists or saying anything negative about the companies --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, our focus will be on the -- celebrating the lives of those that tragically lost their lives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about the \xe2\x80\x9coutside the judicial monastery\xe2\x80\x9d phrase.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the President would not consider a non-lawyer for the high court?\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed that with him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could we?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, by the way.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, this is just another attempt to get your name in the stack.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to tell you a few times, Bob has tried to tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s just not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be interesting, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 All of us hold out hope that a non-lawyer might -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding.\xc2\xa0 So I will -- I have not talked to him about that, but I can certainly pose that to him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the bailout question, is it accurate the President would not foreswear the use of bailouts in the future?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President wants to put into our law a series of regulations that he believes will prevent having to do that, rules of the road that require people to change their behavior and because of that act differently, not put taxpayers at risk.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of -- the strong goal of financial reform, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President would like to see the Senate pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the speech in New York tomorrow, I want to take another crack at the tone.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to have a speech that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of like the radio address last Saturday, which was pretty rough, or is going to be a little bit more conciliatory?\xc2\xa0 What exactly is he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President now for a number of weeks and, quite frankly, a number of years, talk about why we need strong reform, why the actions of some led us into an economic calamity that all had to deal with, as I said, something that started on Main Street and is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, started on Wall Street and then spread throughout Main Street all over this country.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can talk about financial reform without talking about bad actions that have happened in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to ask them to call off the lobbyists, for example?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a safe bet that the lobbyists will be mentioned as part of this.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President mention that before.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the President has mentioned this directly to those in the financial industry.\xc2\xa0 I happen to think, and I think the President shares this optimism, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the course of just the last few days some good progress in ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have bipartisan support for this legislation -- I think the way Senator Dodd has continued to talk with Senator Shelby, Senator Corker and others.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner has met with many Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Larry Summers has met with many Republicans in order to continue trying to find a solution to this.\xc2\xa0 I think clearly some Republican opposition has been overcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And speaking of Dodd, he said this morning, as you intimated, that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- in his words, there was an awful lot of Republicans who are willing to come onboard provided the leadership lets them do that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking -- in all honesty, not to put words in his mouth -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking from the experience of having dealt with a senator before that senator got pulled back, dealing with another senator before that senator got pulled back, dealing with another senator before that senator got pulled back, having the first senator coming -- I mean, I think there is -- I certainly believe within the Republican caucus in the Senate there is a desire to get this done.\xc2\xa0 Whether that desire goes to the top, it certainly -- it appeared to go closer to the top yesterday than it certainly has in the past several weeks.\xc2\xa0 And maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign that more people are understanding of what the President has spoken about for so long in that we have to get some tough rules in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel he\xe2\x80\x99s at the point where he should be making phone calls up there to reinforce things or are you not at that point or maybe don\xe2\x80\x99t need to?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made good progress in the past week.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Geithner and Dr. Summers have been very involved in this on behalf of the administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be making calls?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President?\xc2\xa0 At some point I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt he will, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple months ago at NYU, John Brennan said that post-9/11, American Muslims have been subjected to excessive surveillance, overly broad no-fly lists, the government has been unhelpful to Muslim charities.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, John Brennan works for the President and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall the exact lines in your speech, but the President has great confidence in John Brennan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask about his relationship with the American Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 He has been very --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 John\xe2\x80\x99s or the President\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been very much out front in dealing with Muslims abroad.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some question about whether or not he has been quite so visible at dealing with American Muslims.\xc2\xa0 Do the complaints of birthers and other folks complicate the President\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with the American Muslim community?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have to say, you -- I got to give you credit, Wendell, for getting a lot of crazy people in one question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not including me as one of the crazy people.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m -- but you artfully got in a lot of Internet complaints about the President in one --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not to give credence to the arguments -- I wonder if it complicates the President\xe2\x80\x99s outreach politically.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We have -- the President has dealt with the crazy Internet rumors for years.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s deterred anything that he\xe2\x80\x99s done in understanding what the right thing is to do for this country and to broaden our relationship with Muslims throughout the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this many times, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re -- if after I asked that the President\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate be put on the Internet hasn\xe2\x80\x99t dissuaded you from where he was being born, I\xe2\x80\x99m almost positive that no argument is somehow going to dissuade you from that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I got to tell you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time here worrying about what to do about people that don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President was born here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m the guy who said \xe2\x80\x9cput the birth certificate on the Internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It has apparently, among those people, dissuaded virtually none of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the debt commission, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to say, you are -- woo, you\xe2\x80\x99re all over the map today, Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two places, just a couple places.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tie the debt commission\xe2\x80\x99s hands by ruling out things like a VAT or a tax increase.\xc2\xa0 The President has said he wants to consider all the possible ways of dealing with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it the purpose of a commission to come up with the suggestions that are politically difficult for the President and members of Congress to deal with on their own?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, in order for a recommendation to come forward that has to be voted on by Congress, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have bipartisan support for those recommendations.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think some of the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the fiscal trouble that we\xe2\x80\x99re in now is -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have to -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make tough decisions, as the President has already had to, in terms of freezing non-security spending over the course of the next three years without getting bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we can for the life of the commission play, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t rule this out, does that mean you rule this in\xe2\x80\x9d on virtually every line in the budget from -- again, from here until sometime in December.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes, and I think members of Congress must have believed as well, that this was a worthwhile activity because they nominated many of their own to participate in this activity.\xc2\xa0 I think we all realize that the type of debt that has been run up over the past many years is simply not sustainable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on Savannah\xe2\x80\x99s question, looking at what the President actually said -- \xe2\x80\x9cI want somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be interpreting our Constitution to take into account women\xe2\x80\x99s rights\xe2\x80\x9d -- how is that not the dictionary definition of a litmus test?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the dictionary definition of a litmus test is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how is that not -- how is that not a litmus test?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a litmus test is when you say, Ann, will you ask a direct question about, do you believe this, do you believe that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will ask any nominee to discuss how they view the Constitution and the legal principles enshrined in it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, why is the President not going to an American mosque, like President Bush did?\xc2\xa0 What reason, then, has he not done that in his time in office?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can talk to scheduling.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a priority?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that our continued outreach, both here and abroad, is, as the President said, quite important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on the Supreme Court, does the President want a nominee with empathy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President, he wants -- the President wants somebody who understands how the decisions that a court makes affects real people in the real world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you define that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s the dictionary definition of empathy, but I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to Ann.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the White House definition of empathy?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just go with what I said.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether all of that meets the test of -- the definition of a certain word.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you avoid that word now, after last year?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that word was prominent --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You just asked me if you thought that -- what I said was that word, and I clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from the definition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, does gender or race have any part -- balancing a court have any part in his thinking -- how does that work?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will look at men and women I think among the nominees -- potential nominees.\xc2\xa0 I think he will look at whites, African Americans, Hispanics.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the -- how the -- what the President obviously will make in terms of a final decision, but I think he will have a broad group of people that represent many -- that represent America as a way of looking at the nominee.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would those factors influence him?\xc2\xa0 Would he be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not asked him specifically about that this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quickly, on Goldman Sachs, has anyone inside the White House suggested that the Obama campaign might want to give back any donations that came from Goldman Sachs personnel?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard that.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the campaign, take PAC money, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take money from registered federal lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 And I think anybody that contributed to the campaign at any point knew where the President stood on regulating Wall Street and regulating the financial industry.\xc2\xa0 From, again, that first speech on Wall Street in 2007, the second speech in March of 2008 in the same venue we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go to, and then -- anybody that watched the campaign from sort of mid-September on, obviously the focus was on what to do on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate seems to be moving more quickly on President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominees; last night a few who had been around for a long time were confirmed.\xc2\xa0 Is there a sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s a new chapter beginning, and is there a fear that a Supreme Court confirmation could undo the progress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, I think that the last two times the bipartisan leadership has met with the President, the President has brought up the speed at which his nominees have been considered and mentioned, as I have on several occasions, the notion that there appear to be purposeful delaying tactics largely to slow down whatever the Senate is working on for the express purpose -- for that express purpose, rather than anything that has to do ideologically or in any way with the nominee.\xc2\xa0 He brought that up specifically with Senator McConnell at the last meeting, mentioned the extent to which we had nominees that had cleared the committee and were on the calendar to be dealt with that still had to go through a cloture process.</p>\n<p>So I think that clearly progress is being made in the Senate on getting some of those considered and voted on.\xc2\xa0 I think as the President mentioned at the beginning of the pool spray just a few -- just a little while ago, which was, we are actually at a point in the process -- Justice Stevens signaled his intention to leave the court several weeks before Justice Souter had the year earlier.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of that process.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President say we\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- that gives you a few more weeks and still be able to get something done before the Senate leaves town for the August recess.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that that is a timeline that can and will be met.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why is the President expanding his list of candidates at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To get a broad group of and look at potential nominees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he not happy with the list he\xe2\x80\x99s got?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, Christi, we\xe2\x80\x99re fairly early in this process.\xc2\xa0 And I think the team here wants to provide the President with as many options as is possible, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he just think it\xe2\x80\x99s fun?\xc2\xa0 Does he like to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the briefing memos.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I would consider all of that fun.\xc2\xa0 But even -- I can firmly say that\xe2\x80\x99s not what he had in mind, in terms of fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just ask you this, were there actual names discussed today in the meeting with the senate leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get a readout from those that were in the meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Robert, in terms of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech, how much will President Obama focus specifically on derivatives, the notion of regulating derivatives, in that speech?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it may be a focus, the focus.\xc2\xa0 Will he detail specific policy on derivatives?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret, I would say this, going back to the white paper that the administration released in I think June of last year, we had some very specific recommendations for bringing out of the dark and regulating derivatives.\xc2\xa0 It is an aspect of something the President will talk about.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that it is the focus of the speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, the Republicans seem to be suggesting that the White House is pretty deeply involved in shaping how the derivatives legislation will come to the floor, either in terms of the Lincoln bill or in terms of the floor bill.\xc2\xa0 How much is the White House driving the train, in terms of the derivatives legislation?\xc2\xa0 And how much is the President still at this point letting what happens happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have -- again, I think as I said a couple of days ago, I think many in the industry believe that Senator Lincoln was going to introduce, or maybe hoped Senator Lincoln was going to introduce a bill that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong on derivatives.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that was not the case.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s overlap in the proposals that the administration made in its white paper that are also contained in Senator Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s bill.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- Senator Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s bill, I believe, passed out of committee just as I was making my way down here.\xc2\xa0 And the administration will continue to work with Senator Reid, Senator Dodd, Republicans, and others in ensuring that whatever gets out of the Senate is very strong on derivatives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But today, has the White House kept a hands-off approach, or have you been very deeply involved?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me speak -- let me speak to Secretary Geithner about that.\xc2\xa0 I know that they -- I think Senator Lincoln has obviously shared proposals.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at their proposals.\xc2\xa0 And, as I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s commonality and there\xe2\x80\x99s some things that we also would like to see contained in that legislation.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the apparent progress that the White House is making winning or potentially winning over the Republicans on the financial legislation a sign that -- you believe, a sign that Republicans are coming over based on merit or based on their political position, based on the politics of the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Merit-based?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you winning Republican votes, if indeed you are, based on the merits of the legislation?\xc2\xa0 Or is there also, do you believe, a political calculation that Republicans are making on this based on politics?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this, I think that from a pure policy perspective, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- Senator Dodd has, and we have, worked with him on ensuring a piece of legislation that puts those strong rules into place.\xc2\xa0 I think there is much merit in the bill, obviously.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt, to be perfectly candid with you, that Republicans have realized for going on a week that they were in a politically difficult position after a Wall Street meeting and a speech that seemed to read right out of a memo written a year ago.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, questions on two different topics.\xc2\xa0 One, how many candidates or potentials has the President vetted so far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Has he?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vetted so far.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Several.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want a specific, quantified number, please.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 More than a couple.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That means more than two?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, \xe2\x80\x9cseveral\xe2\x80\x9d generally does, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- look, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting better at the -- at the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- ability to pry information I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my job.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 Again, I will say this, I do believe the -- I do believe we are earlier in the process, again, just from the sheer standpoint of what has been on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt the President has had an opportunity, as a result of people that participated and went through this process last time, that we have more information on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say, though, that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t a series of individuals and potential nominees that the team is assembling more on for the President to look.</p>\n<p>So since he\xe2\x80\x99s talked -- he\xe2\x80\x99s personally vetted at least two, are some of those he\xe2\x80\x99s vetted minorities?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably given up all I should give up for today, lest we blow through all the questions for the remainder of the term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not likely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was trying.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the second topic, on Black Farmers.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of contradiction between one end of Pennsylvania Avenue here, and with the Black Farmers themselves.\xc2\xa0 One, the Black Farmers want to meet specifically with the President; they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that there is enough commitment from this White House because the monies have not been attached to anything on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Then the Hill is saying that it was not made into an emergency issue of the White House, was not deemed emergent -- an emergent issue for them to act on quickly.\xc2\xa0 So what is happening?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that representatives met with administration officials last week.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you more information on who and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Minus the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, right.\xc2\xa0 And, April, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just continue to say that this is an issue that folks very high up in the administration continue to be focused on and working on and we\xe2\x80\x99re working towards a solution that would keep the commitment that the President made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you looking to find ways to attach that $1.25 billion to something on the Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s legislative and there\xe2\x80\x99s financing decisions that are being looked through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what was the -- could you tell us what was the impetus behind the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to Senator Brown, I believe it was yesterday?\xc2\xa0 And in a related topic, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of the legislation now pending before the Arizona governor on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some background on the immigration one and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that out to everybody.</p>\n<p>The President made a series of phone calls yesterday from the plane, including to Senator Brown, about the issue of immigration -- a commitment that the President had made in meeting with immigration reform advocates and with Senators Schumer and Graham, that are working on legislation, that he would spend some time talking with Republicans to gauge their desire to participate in the process of finding a comprehensive immigration reform solution and to talk through the timetables of when that can happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which senators did he call?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the list with me, but I can try to find -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got that in my e-mail.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, obviously the conversation with Senator Brown also included some discussion I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a download on, on financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something -- I want to say I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that Senator Brown brought up, but I will check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you telling us you will tell us who the President called?\xc2\xa0 Because sometimes you say you\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to us, but then when we check -- (laughter) -- so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re committing here to tell us who he called.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do I do that?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I will get you a list of those names.**</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the White House chief of staff in a TV interview a couple of days ago mentioned that he might be interested in running for the job of mayor of Chicago.\xc2\xa0 Do you think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good gig.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s generally a good idea for someone whose portfolio includes the entire country and has a whole bunch of issues on his plate that are sort of nationwide issues to talk about a preference for serving in a specific locality?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Glenn, in all honesty I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that in that interview that the chief of staff said anything that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said before.\xc2\xa0 This obviously -- look, Chicago is Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s home, it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a city that he greatly loves and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that has certainly been -- something that he\xe2\x80\x99s discussed in the past.</p>\n<p>I think I would also point out that he\xe2\x80\x99s a strong supporter of the current mayor and is supporting him for reelection.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President would endorse him?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of those 730-day hypotheticals that I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay away from.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just sort of following up on the phone call to Senator Brown, can you give us a sense of -- because the reports seemed to convey that the President was set to start on immigration reform rather soon.\xc2\xa0 And you just mentioned that he was gauging the interest of Republicans to participate.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of the timing about where the White House stands on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, I think it was -- I think I saw reports that there was this notion that the Senate would take this up within the month or within a month.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President has -- is very interested in this, has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President made a commitment to those working on the proposal in the Senate to help find additional support, but the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that the President enumerated a \xe2\x80\x9cwe would go to this in a month\xe2\x80\x9d timeline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Brown said that the President told him the issue was moving forward, not necessarily to the Senate floor, but moving forward in a month.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- well, I mean, look, Senator Schumer and Senator Graham have been working on this for many months, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- so I think, quite frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of reaching out and talking to Republicans at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get comprehensive immigration reform legislation through the Senate on a party-line vote, which means you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have bipartisan support and that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- again, the President made a commitment to Senators Shelby and -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Schumer and Graham, to reach out to Republicans and did so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was heckled pretty persistently on Monday night about \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal.\xc2\xa0 Six LGBT veterans chained themselves to the White House gates yesterday -- I think you actually saw it.\xc2\xa0 All of these actions --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was walking through the park at that time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were walking, just a casual walk through the park.\xc2\xa0 Were you pushed back by Park Police -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say -- can I mention the Park Police?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think many people I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and I think we were asked yesterday the role in which the White House played in that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Park Police has -- rightly took responsibility for some overzealous actions; they corrected those -- albeit belatedly.\xc2\xa0 The White House and the Secret Service did not have any role in that decision-making and I think the Park Police has taken -- rightly taken responsibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to the question.\xc2\xa0 So there was the heckling on Monday night, there\xe2\x80\x99s the veterans yesterday at the White House gates handcuffing themselves to the fence.\xc2\xa0 All of these actions are aimed at getting repeal this year, something the White House has sort of declined to commit to since the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House misjudged the level of patience among LGBT and grassroots activists on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would remind anybody on this issue -- look, first of all, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President made a commitment in the presidential campaign, and understands the passion that people hold the belief that all should be able to serve.\xc2\xa0 The President holds that belief too.</p>\n<p>But I would remind folks that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a belief that the President held in 2007 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a belief that the President held in running for the Senate as far back as 2003.</p>\n<p>The President has made and is committed to making this changed law.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s underestimated the -- as you said, the patience of some.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to see this law changed, just as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and others in the military say that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for that change to happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to them letting the Pentagon work through its working group process until December 1st, is that true?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s committed to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The President has set forward a process with the Joint -- the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and with the Secretary of Defense to work through this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before any legislative action is taken -- that rules out legislative action this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- the House and the Senate are obviously a different branch of government.\xc2\xa0 The President has a process and a proposal I think that he believes is the best way forward to seeing, again, the commitment that he\xe2\x80\x99s made for many years in trying to -- changing that law.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:04 P.M.
