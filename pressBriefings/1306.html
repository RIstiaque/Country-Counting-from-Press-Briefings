EDT<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Fire away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell us about the fundraising part of this.\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s he fundraising for?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a DNC fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 But on specific numbers and details, I\xe2\x80\x99d go to the DNC for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say you would have some specific numbers afterwards?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I said on the specific numbers you should go to the DNC on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the message going to be pretty similar to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in him say in the past couple fundraisers?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about the importance of continuing to move forward and the choice that voters will have in the fall between Democrats who are -- who will continue the policies that are getting us out of this economic crisis, and Republicans who want to put us back with the policies that got us into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President hearing about the hoped-for effort tonight to plug the BP well?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re watching cautiously.\xc2\xa0 You know, this is obviously slowed down by the storms -- Bonnie -- that came sweeping through the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly monitoring and the President is continuing to get updates on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- President Obama think Charlie Rangel should accept reprimand and/or step down?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President made comments on this over the weekend in an interview that was taped on Friday but aired on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 He was a leader on ethics when he was in the state senate, he was a leader on ethics in the United States Senate, on the campaign trail for President, and as President has put into place some of the most sweeping ethics reforms in the history of the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan process that\xe2\x80\x99s working through some serious questions here and the President thinks that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that they conduct that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually an answer to the question.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Say that again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually an answer to the question.\xc2\xa0 A wise answer, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually an answer to the question.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The answer to the question is there\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan process that\xe2\x80\x99s working its way through and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until they appropriately answer all those questions before weighing in on something that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter before that committee.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he did weigh in, in the comments over the weekend, saying that he should end his career in a dignified fashion.\xc2\xa0 What is he saying with that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to this process, he\xe2\x80\x99s just not going to put his thumb on the scale of its outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just do that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speech length today, first speech?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, is this speech today going to be sort of the start of a series of events leading up to the August 31st deadline?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see him talk about this more?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President, the Vice President, and members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration talking about some of the successes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on in the world right now, so a lot of Americans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that when the President started this administration, there were some 144,000 American troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 By the end of August, there will be 94,000 less troops there; we\xe2\x80\x99ll be down to 50,000.\xc2\xa0 America\xe2\x80\x99s combat mission will have ended, and we will have transferred security over to the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You started the Iraq strategy in February of 2009.\xc2\xa0 It was predicated on the idea that he wanted to keep enough troops there long enough for there to be a government in place.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no government in place, won\xe2\x80\x99t be a government in place by the time they get down to 50,000.\xc2\xa0 Why the change in strategy?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we need -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on the real success that the Iraqi people have had at democracy here.\xc2\xa0 And if you look back at the last elections, it took some six months to form a government.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that there are competing parties and individuals who want to lead this democracy is a sign of the kind of progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there has been some positive movement on talks in forming a government, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that in the shorter term there will be a government in place.\xc2\xa0 And also keep in mind that there is a functioning transitional government that\'s in place right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been -- since the last election that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to move forward on that, and they might not by the time we reach the August 31st deadline?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President is watching.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we can to help facilitate them along.\xc2\xa0 But when you consider that last time it took them six months to put together the government, the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a stable transitional government in place right now is a sign that this process is working.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How stable is it, though, Bill?\xc2\xa0 I mean they\'re deadlocked on where they\'re going to go from here.\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a governing vacuum as August 31st hits?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s very stable.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of a governing vacuum, the fact that the government is functioning right now and the government is pretty effectively taking on the duties that are prescribed to governments is a good sign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the next time the President is going to speak to a troop audience?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to see some of the troops coming back?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an answer for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that there is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 Without looking at the schedule, I don\'t want to just guess.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this -- what message does the Iraq drawdown this month have for those who are concerned at home about Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at two separate issues.\xc2\xa0 The message on Iraq is that the President made a commitment on the campaign trail and in the first days of his presidency that he would end the combat mission in Iraq at the end of August of this year.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that the message is that when the President makes a commitment, he keeps it.</p>\n<p>So as it relates to Afghanistan, the President made comments on that in the interview yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that a little bit today.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have some difficult challenges in that country, but we do think that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to make progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He made a commitment to begin pulling out troops from Afghanistan in July 2011.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi said she hoped it\xe2\x80\x99s more than just a few thousand that Vice President Biden talked about a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Defense Secretary Gates said, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s basically very few people at first.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is exactly where he was when he laid out this strategy with the troops at West Point, and that is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to assess where we are.\xc2\xa0 July 2011 is an inflection point.\xc2\xa0 We will begin to transition our troops out.\xc2\xa0 But he is an executive who likes to base his decisions on facts, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take a fact-based assessment and make the right decision then.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somebody saw Reggie carrying a baseball bat.\xc2\xa0 Is it a prop for something today or is it going somewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Reggie was carrying a baseball bat, so I would encourage you guys to be on your best behavior.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, he is meeting with the executive board of AFL-CIO Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 What is on the agenda there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on more specifics.\xc2\xa0 But as it stands, they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about a wide range of issues.\xc2\xa0 He will also use this as an opportunity to talk about some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to get the economy moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to see steady growth.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we need to do and the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with the rate of growth.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be talking about jobs and the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on tax cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And one other question.\xc2\xa0 Bloomberg Markets reported about the death benefits and insurance companies holding the benefits.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President can take reform action by executive order on something like that?\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, can you check?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he can do that by executive order.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you be able to check?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check that out for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are any prominent Georgia Democrats going to be with him today at the fundraiser?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there will be some prominent Democrats, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure you guys get a list of those before we land.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Roy Barnes going to be at any of these things?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He won\xe2\x80\x99t be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is he?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He had some previously scheduled events.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get us a list of the Georgia Democrats who won\xe2\x80\x99t be there?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roy Barnes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Democrats in the state of Georgia, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a full list of those.\xc2\xa0 Sorry about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Shirley Sherrod going to be there -- have you said?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I just glanced at the list, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that she was on it.\xc2\xa0 She is from a different part of the state.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n9:54 A.M.
