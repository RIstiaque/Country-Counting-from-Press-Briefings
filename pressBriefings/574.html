Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>2:07 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 For those of you who follow Amy Brundage on Twitter, you know that I have with me today a special guest, the Chairman of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman.\xc2\xa0 As an early Christmas present, he is going to present to you an overview of the economy in 2013 and discuss some of the early policy issues related to the economy going forward.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99ll do his presentation.\xc2\xa0 He will take questions related to matters economic from you.\xc2\xa0 If you could hold your questions on other subjects until after Jason is done, I will remain here to take those questions and at least try to answer them.\xc2\xa0 With that, I give you Jason Furman.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So we thought we would use the opportunity of the end of the year to review what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on in the economy in the past year and some of the important economic issues.\xc2\xa0 Last year I also had a chance to do an end-of-the-year briefing at 11:00 p.m. on December 31st for many of you in the Roosevelt Room on the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 While it was tempting to wait for two more weeks of economic data to have this discussion, we decided we would jump the gun and declare the end of the year today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can come back.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 We can come back, too.\xc2\xa0 So what you see overall was an economy that finished -- is finishing 2013 in a stronger place than it began the year.\xc2\xa0 While there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done to strengthen the economy, create jobs, and lower the unemployment rate, this progress is significant and notable.\xc2\xa0 And with the budget deal, we now have better fiscal conditions for sustainable economic growth into the year 2014.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTo go back and review some of those numbers and just take you on a whirlwind tour of the economy, we\xe2\x80\x99ll start with jobs, which is the most timely indicator of the state of the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we have been adding over 2 million jobs a year for the past several years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve added 8.1 million private sector jobs in 45 straight months of private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0 And in the last couple of months, jobs have come in above expectations, subsequently been revised up, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing about 200,000 jobs per month.</p>\n<p>Turning next to GDP, you have seen each quarter of this year GDP growth was stronger than the last quarter.\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make too much of any given quarter\xe2\x80\x99s data; for example, that 3.6 percent in the third quarter, part of that was inventory buildup, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as good as that headline number looked.\xc2\xa0 Conversely, in the fourth quarter, the truth will probably be even better than what is shown in the headline number.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you drill down and look at the sources of that GDP growth, the fastest-growing component of GDP has been housing, which is your next slide.\xc2\xa0 Housing has grown now for 12 straight quarters; it\xe2\x80\x99s grown at about 10 to 15 percent per quarter.\xc2\xa0 Housing starts and permits have now broken the 1 million unit barrier, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still more potential for growth -- because if you look at the total number of households that are formed each year in the United States, add the number of houses that depreciate, you would think a steady state level is that you need to build 1.6 million homes per year.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been rising, but there is still further to go in terms of housing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPart of what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on in the recovery is a cyclical recovery from a financial crisis, which you see in areas like housing.\xc2\xa0 Part of it is a reflection of some deeper structural underlying trends.\xc2\xa0 The first of those trends is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in energy.\xc2\xa0 The United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas of any country in the world.\xc2\xa0 We exceed Russia, we exceed Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a steady increase in our domestic production of oil, a steady decrease in our imports.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd now, for the first in a long time, our domestic production is exceeding the amount we import.\xc2\xa0 And we saw EIA projections that they put out earlier this week that they expect for the next many years production to continue to increase in the oil sector.\xc2\xa0 And then when you combine that with decreased use associated with things like the vehicle role, it further improves the trade balance we have in petroleum, which is part of why our current account deficit or our trade deficit overall is the lowest as a share of GDP that it\xe2\x80\x99s been since the 1990s.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second structural trend that I think is very important in the economy is one that I also think has generally been underappreciated, and that is a slowdown in the growth of the cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 If you look at real per capita national health expenditures, they\xe2\x80\x99re now growing at the slowest rate that they have in the last 50 years.\xc2\xa0 A decade ago, it was very common to read in the newspaper that rapidly rising health costs were hurting the competitiveness of American businesses, especially in sectors like manufacturing and other export industries that have more generous benefits.\xc2\xa0 The converse is true today.\xc2\xa0 With those costs growing more slowly, it\xe2\x80\x99s helping the competitiveness of America\xe2\x80\x99s businesses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Council of Economic Advisers did an extensive report on the causes of this slowdown and, in brief, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of them.\xc2\xa0 The slowdown predates the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Part of it is related to the economy, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that you can directly trace the Affordable Care Act to the continued and accelerated pace of the slowdown in health costs even as the economy has continued to recover.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe next part of the story I wanted to tell is the deficit.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard many times before and you have up on the screen, we\'ve now just gone through the largest postwar deficit reduction over a four-year period, and we\'ve gone over it by a long shot.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRemarkably, 2.7 percent of that 5.7 percent of GDP deficit reduction happened in just the last year.\xc2\xa0 And what makes that so significant is that 2.7 percent of deficit reduction last year was a drag on our economy.\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut going away made it harder for consumer spending.\xc2\xa0 The sequester going into effect cost us 750,000 jobs and 0.6 percent off our GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 And despite that very rapid deficit reduction, we still managed to see a strengthening in growth over the course of the year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe good thing is now that we have a budget agreement, we can expect more fiscal stability over the next year and a half.\xc2\xa0 We can expect the deficit to continue to decline in the medium and long run, but much more gradually in the short run, and so we\'ll have both certainty and fiscal stability for growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI last wanted to very briefly turn to what this means for families, and the most important indicator there is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to wages.\xc2\xa0 And here the good story is wage growth, which had been negative, has turned positive and grown by 1.1 percent over the last year.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still digging out of a very deep hole there and wages haven\'t come close to keeping up with productivity over the last several decades, but at least it is moving in the right direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe next slide shows that at the same time the other challenge we\'re faced is -- that was average wages -- when you look at the distribution, you see inequality continue to increase and you saw that continue to increase into 2013.\xc2\xa0 This is a trend that\'s been with us for decades, one that is not going to turn around overnight, and is a motivation for why the President cares, for example, about raising the minimum wage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd finally, the last to return to the job market, where we began, the unemployment rate has come down steadily by six-tenths of a percent in the last six months.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s come down for all types of workers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 And the reason it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptably high is not the short-term unemployed, which is back to the same average it was before the crisis; it\xe2\x80\x99s the long-term unemployed, which at 2.6 percent is higher than any long-term unemployment rate we\'ve reported from 1948 through the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a reminder of why extending unemployment insurance benefits is so important.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve never been allowed to lapse with an unemployment rate at this level.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a reminder of why we continue to need to focus on creating jobs and bringing down the unemployment rate so it can bring it down for that group.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So let\'s get questions.\xc2\xa0 Nedra.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sticking with the job market, the Fed said yesterday it expects unemployment to fall as low as 6.3 percent next year and 5.8 percent in 2015.\xc2\xa0 And both of those are better than the September forecast.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering if that tracks with your expectations and whether you think the new budget that eliminates some of the sequester drag will bring about even better unemployment figures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any comment on the Fed in particular.\xc2\xa0 The unemployment over the last six months has surprised us by coming down more quickly than we had expected or than other forecasters had expected.\xc2\xa0 As I said, it came down -- it has come down by an average of one-tenth every month for six straight months.\xc2\xa0 And that was -- people expected something like that to happen over more like a year than a six-month period.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think what you see a number of forecasters doing is saying, given what we\'ve seen, maybe we have to revise it going forward and assume it will be lower.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the budget deal will help.\xc2\xa0 CBO had said the sequester was costing 750,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 This replaces a substantial amount of the discretionary portion of the sequester, so the converse to that statement would also be true that this budget agreement will help the economy add more jobs than it otherwise would have in 2014.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans express fears that the cost of Obamacare will weigh heavily on the economy going into next year.\xc2\xa0 Do you share those concerns?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 I think the opposite is true.\xc2\xa0 I think the Affordable Care Act has been helping the economy and will continue to help the economy.\xc2\xa0 I think it has contributed to the slowdown in the overall growth of health costs, which is good for the competitiveness of American businesses.\xc2\xa0 I think in 2014, when you have the exchange up and running, that that will further help labor markets by, for example, increasing the ability of workers to move from job to job so they don\'t get locked into one job just because of the health insurance, which improves mobility and increases productivity and entrepreneurship.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd finally, the Affordable Care Act is a key part of deficit reduction, especially over the medium and long term, where it\'s a much more significant source of deficit reduction over that horizon than the sequester is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Picking up on the comment about chronic unemployment, what do you think are the structural problems behind this extended duration of chronic unemployment?\xc2\xa0 And I know you\'re in favor of extending unemployment insurance benefits, but that\'s just to keep people essentially economically afloat.\xc2\xa0 What structurally and from a policy perspective should the White House push and Congress do to change the atmosphere for these folks who have been unemployed for so very long?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Can we get the last picture up again?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if we can.\xc2\xa0 That last picture tells two stories.\xc2\xa0 One is that that red line, the long-term unemployed, is higher than it used to be, and that\'s I think the biggest short-run economic problem we face.\xc2\xa0 But it also tells a more hopeful story, which is that line is still coming down pretty sharply.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a group that is in a totally different boat than the rest of the economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is a group that is in the same boat as the whole economy.\xc2\xa0 And anything that strengthens the economy and brings the unemployment rate down, as we\'ve seen over the last several years, is also going to bring that long-term unemployment rate down.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not bringing it down as fast as we\'d like it to.\xc2\xa0 So we\'d love to see that pace grow faster.\xc2\xa0 Part of that is just the same things you do about any unemployment -- things like the budget agreement we just reached; things like investments in infrastructure which can hire, for example, construction workers who have a disproportionately high unemployment rate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut you also want to think of some things targeted specifically at the long-term unemployed, including getting at the question of why, according to studies, some companies seem to discriminate against the long-term unemployed when it comes to hiring and what you can do to educate companies about that and institute better practices in their hiring.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about wages?\xc2\xa0 It is up, but that\xe2\x80\x99s still a pretty shallow number -- 1.1 percent over 12 months.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I mean, 1.1 is a lot better than what we\'ve been seeing.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the typical thing you expect, which is the first thing you see is GDP growth; that started in 2009.\xc2\xa0 The second thing you expect is the unemployment rate to start coming down; that happened in 2010.\xc2\xa0 As labor markets get tighter, that then leads to higher wages, and it took us a couple more years to get to that point.\xc2\xa0 But we have been at that point for the last year, and it\'s been because nominal wages have risen and because inflation has remained stable and slightly lower.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Bush years, even when the labor markets were tight, wage growth wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as great as it had been in the past.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long-running problem.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 This has been several decades of a major problem that the U.S. economy has been grappling with, and it\xe2\x80\x99s related to what the President has called the defining issue of our time, which is inequality.\xc2\xa0 And so you\xe2\x80\x99ve had the productivity growth, and the question is who is capturing the gains associated with that productivity growth.\xc2\xa0 And our answer to that is everything from a short-run answer -- which is the minimum wage which would help people right away -- to, at the other end of the spectrum, investments in early-childhood education which will help them 10, 20 -- I mean 20, 30 years down the line as they go into the labor force.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Jason, considering the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s action yesterday, is the White House considering any new stimulus in 2014 to pick up the slack if that becomes necessary or if you deem that that becomes necessary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not commenting on the Fed.\xc2\xa0 But our plans are the same as what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been, which is we would like to see, for example, upfront investments in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to see unemployment insurance continued, which is a way to boost purchasing power.\xc2\xa0 But most of the proposals the President has been talking about aren\xe2\x80\x99t one-time things; they\xe2\x80\x99re things like business tax reform.\xc2\xa0 So in the Recovery Act, we did bonus depreciation, which was a one-time thing to help investment.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re about reforming the business tax code permanently.\xc2\xa0 In the Recovery Act, you did upfront investments in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re about a long-term reauthorization in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo all those things are just as important today as they were a week ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we should start to see interest rates go up, what would the impact be on the economy?\xc2\xa0 Is it strong enough to sustain that at this point, do you think?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to comment on that question.\xc2\xa0 But the parts of the economy that we\xe2\x80\x99re contributing to, which is on the fiscal side, we do think are in a stronger policy environment going into 2014.\xc2\xa0 And when you look at a sector like housing, ultimately the determinants of that are more demographic than anything else.\xc2\xa0 If each year there\xe2\x80\x99s 2 million more people -- some of those people live together so there\xe2\x80\x99s more like 1 million more houses -- those people all need houses, they need to buy house; houses also fall apart and depreciate.\xc2\xa0 So ultimately, we do think you need to build 1.6 million, something in that neighborhood, houses a year.\xc2\xa0 And over the course of several years there may be ups and downs, but you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to be moving in that direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Have you locked down your economic forecast for next year\xe2\x80\x99s budget?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 If you look at previous budgets, they always post the date at which they\xe2\x80\x99ve been locked down, and that date is usually I think in November is what most of those past budgets would tell you the forecasts were done in.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t generally release the forecast until around the time of the budget.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s to answer your follow-up.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the economy growing again, what do your projections say?\xc2\xa0 Are you able to talk to us about what your projections say about inflation and interest rates?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this period of low inflation, practically nonexistent interest rates.\xc2\xa0 How long does that last?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we will have an updated forecast in our next budget.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific numerical answer to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on your point about deficits, the biggest deficit reduction over that five-year period, can you also share -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s also that these are the biggest deficits we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over that period, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is the total amount that we have seen added to the debt during that period and how does that compare to any other similar period?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an easy number for me to get and look up for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it off the top of my head.\xc2\xa0 But understand --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But these deficits are still historically high.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the reduction is high --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is great because we\xe2\x80\x99ve --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The fiscal policy is countercyclical.\xc2\xa0 It has automatic stabilizers.\xc2\xa0 When the economy weakens, tax revenue goes down and things like unemployment insurance go up.\xc2\xa0 When President Obama walked in the door in the year 2009, the deficit was already projected to be in the neighborhood of 10 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 That was largely because of the overall economic conditions.\xc2\xa0 As those economic conditions have improved, that\xe2\x80\x99s brought the deficit down.\xc2\xa0 The deficit reduction has exceeded what you would expect just from the improvement in the economy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99ve done things like cut spending; have a tax deal that raised revenue on high-income households; and then health spending in Medicare and Medicaid has come in below expectations in part because of legislation like the Affordable Care Act, in part because of a slowdown that\'s broader than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting the deficit problem is solved, are you, by saying we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this record deficit reduction?\xc2\xa0 The deficits are still historically high.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The deficit problem we have is a medium- and long-run problem.\xc2\xa0 That problem is a meaningful one.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that the President\xe2\x80\x99s last budget had a number of proposals on both the entitlement side and the revenue side to address.\xc2\xa0 He spent much of this year working very hard to try to interest Republicans in working together with him on a larger balanced deal that would address both entitlements and revenues -- both of which are a driver of those medium- and long-term deficits.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fiscal deal we got wasn\xe2\x80\x99t everything he would have liked, and it was smaller than what he proposed to do in his budget, but it did help with the medium- and long-run deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is the best measure of the long-run deficit is something economists call the fiscal gap.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how much you have to raise taxes or cut spending immediately as a share of GDP to stabilize the debt over the next 75 years.\xc2\xa0 CBO\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the fiscal gap is that it\xe2\x80\x99s 1.7 percent of GDP, which is the amount you need to do one of those to stabilize the deficit every 75 years.\xc2\xa0 Our budget is very close to that in terms of its total deficit reduction proposals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat 1.7 percent of GDP is considerably smaller than the forecast CBO was making for the long-run deficit just a few years ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, then Bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, going through all the things that you sketched out here today, the situation looks brighter -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s energy, or the budget deal, or health care costs, whatever.\xc2\xa0 Can you just summarize what the CEA looks at as the risk of a drag on the economy going into 2014?\xc2\xa0 What is the thing that most concerns you that could stop this rapid pace of growth?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 One is we care a lot about how these gains translate, and some of the slides I went through show that while wages are growing, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made up for the past declines in wages, that inequalities continue to rise, and that long-term unemployment is high.\xc2\xa0 So even in any scenario, we are still going to be contending with and trying to overcome those challenges, which are a motivation for the agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about risks to GDP growth overall, if I take Congress at their word that they\'re going to raise the debt limit, if for some reason that isn\xe2\x80\x99t what happened, or there was a sustained period of brinksmanship like we saw last time, that certainly would hurt the economy relative to what would otherwise happen.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd our economy has been buffeted from shocks from around the world over the last several years.\xc2\xa0 The eurozone crisis had a very big impact on the United States.\xc2\xa0 Things are strengthening in Europe.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress in their financial system, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not at all predicting anything anywhere else in the world, but unpredictable things happen in different parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re integrated into the global economy, so we\xe2\x80\x99re always going to care about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you also add a comment on the state and local picture going into 2014?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The state and local sector has actually been a positive for overall GDP growth for the last two or three quarters, which was a turnabout from where it had been.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at state and local hiring, that\'s also in general been adding to job growth.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a lot of that in education.\xc2\xa0 So that had been a drag on the economy, that sector, and a drag on employment growth.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s turned into a small positive in the other direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re still well below the number of teachers that you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to have, for example, because of all the layoffs we had in the wake of the recession, but it\xe2\x80\x99s at least moving in the right direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of gloom and doom from the President and others about the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Now, the sequester has been in place for, what, six months or more, and yet you paint a very rosy picture today.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the disconnect between how bad the sequester was supposed to be on the economy and the fact we\xe2\x80\x99re doing so well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you look at the economy for the last two quarters, for example, the growth rate averaged 3.0 percent.\xc2\xa0 If you look at just the private components of GDP and take out government consumption and investment, that grew at 3.7 percent annual rate over that half of the year.\xc2\xa0 So we have a private sector that has been very strong and getting stronger over the course of the year.\xc2\xa0 And the stance of fiscal policy has been to some degree holding that growth back, but not nearly enough to -- not anywhere close to undoing that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you look -- as I said, CBO projected that you would lose six-tenths of a percentage point off your growth rate because of the sequester; it\xe2\x80\x99s very plausible that all of our growth rates would have been six-tenths of a percentage point higher were it not for the sequester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not as bad as we thought it was going to be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying the private sector has been stronger than most anyone would have projected a year ago.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, do you worry about the size of the national debt?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s $17.2 trillion now.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the size of the entire economy.\xc2\xa0 Does that give you sleepless nights in any way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I worry about the direction that that debt is going in.\xc2\xa0 And right now that debt as a share of the economy is on a downward track over the medium term.\xc2\xa0 That downward track then reverses and starts to go on an upward track, and that\'s why the President was trying to pursue a deal that included more entitlement reforms and more tax reform that would raise revenue from high-income households.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think what you really care about is are you managing that debt in the way it should -- not where you are today, but what direction you\xe2\x80\x99re going, and is that direction sustainable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By direction, do you mean as a size -- compared to the size of the economy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the test I would have for fiscal policy is whether over the medium- and long-run your debt is falling as a share of the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one we can achieve over the medium term.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more work to do to get there for the long term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what happens if interest rates start going up, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that increase the amount of interest on the debt the government has to pay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 If you look at the forecast that both the Congressional Budget Office and the administration have used for the last several years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always assumed that interest rates would rise over the 10-year budget window from the unusually low levels that they\'re at now.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying whether they -- it could happen more than we think or less than we think, but we certainly -- the forecast that both us and CBO do, do take into account the expectation that interest rates would rise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talking about the euro, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the euro, what is the biggest outside threat to the U.S. economy?\xc2\xa0 Are you looking at a slowdown in emerging markets, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in China for instance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 We look at all of that.\xc2\xa0 And all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is it\xe2\x80\x99s a big world, and unexpected things happen in a big world.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have any particular expectation or forecast of something.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s what you always want to be vigilant about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So aside from the emerging markets, a slowdown there, how does that threaten U.S. growth assumptions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason to predict anything, but you saw -- we are an interdependent economy, and things that happen elsewhere in the world can have a big impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you look at exports for example, our export growth slowed to almost a halt in the year 2012 as Europe went through its problems.\xc2\xa0 In the last couple quarters, our export growth has picked up substantially, and that\'s helped our economy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s partly a function of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here domestically to help exports, but a much bigger factor there is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the rest of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re now concerned about inequality -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there has been any changes to the labor supply that help or hinder inequality?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99d like is to increase the supply of skilled labor.\xc2\xa0 I mean, inequality is associated with something called skill-biased technological change, that there\'s a lot more demand for skilled people.\xc2\xa0 And that drives their wages up to -- you increase that supply, get more people in education that helps offset that and reduce the total amount of inequality over the long run.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot of things that matter for inequality, but that supply of skilled workers is certainly one of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you look at the jobs numbers and the employment picture, the labor force participation rate has been on the decline.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s sort of a longer-term trend, but how much do you worry about that when looking at the labor market?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly something you want to look at.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the participation rate was going to decline after around 2008 was something that was predictable and it was also predicted.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the Economic Report of the President that the Council of Economic Advisers put out in 2004 -- and I\'m sure most of you remember this passage, but for those of you that don\'t -- it said that after 2008, you would start to see the participation rate fall.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you look at CBO forecasts from the middle of the last decade, they were predicting the same thing.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is when a baby boomer reaches retirement age -- and they reached age -- the first of them reached age 62 in 2008, if they retire that means they leave the labor force and the labor force participation rate goes down.\xc2\xa0 That explains a big part -- about half of the decline in the participation rate that we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And you can do pretty mechanical calculations that show that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that\'s gone on is that whenever the unemployment rate is higher than normal, you\'re going to have some people who are going to stay in school longer, maybe give up looking for a job, decide not to come back into the labor force because they\'re a little bit nervous about it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s also helped bring the participation rate down, and that happens when unemployment is elevated.\xc2\xa0 But the converse is true there, that as the unemployment rate comes down, some of those people come back.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut you\'re going to continue to have the demographic trend.\xc2\xa0 So going forward, demography is going to be making our participation rate go down.\xc2\xa0 A strengthening economy will make our participation rate go up.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ll end up seeing some net effect of the two of those in the data.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you have thought that people would have gotten back in already?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Some people -- a study from the Philadelphia Fed found that over, I believe it was the last seven quarters, but it was a time horizon very much like that, 100 percent of the decline in participation was due to demography and zero percent of it was due to the business cycle.\xc2\xa0 So I think you are seeing some reversing on the cyclical side.\xc2\xa0 But the participation rate does have this just very strong -- if you turn 90 and leave your job, the participation rate goes down.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s more people turning 90 now than 20 years ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier you described the budget deal the President is about to sign as something that\'s sustaining -- that\'s going to sustain growth for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And then, you also said that one of the things that you\'re most concerned about looking forward is the sustained brinksmanship that might happen in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Is aversion to that brinksmanship enough to keep things like unemployment insurance or tax cut loopholes out of the President\'s budget picture moving forward?\xc2\xa0 Is conciliation on those issues enough to keep that out of the picture?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that trying to extend unemployment insurance is a source of uncertainty for the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had 12 -- it\'s passed 12 times since 2008.\xc2\xa0 Most of those votes have been with strong bipartisan majorities, and there\'s no reason that that can\'t happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are the compromises going to become more -- are the compromises going to be more tilted toward conciliation if we\'re trying to avoid sustained brinksmanship?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to jettison things like the tax cut loopholes, looking for tax cut loopholes to close?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The President still thinks those are an important part of our overall economic strategy.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hearing about our deficit over the medium and long run.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hearing about the importance of making our businesses more competitive through business tax reform; the importance of making sure that 1.3 million people don\'t lose their unemployment insurance right after Christmas.\xc2\xa0 All of those remain important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a lot of the things that the President and the CEA have described as important to a balanced approach are not in this current budget deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 This budget deal is a subset in effect of the President\'s overall more comprehensive budget proposal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend this, but because of you I have the theme song to the Beverly Hillbillies going around in my head.\xc2\xa0 I mean, because our energy picture since 2009 is radically better today than it was when the President first walked into office.\xc2\xa0 In light of that, are you giving him, the Council, any advice as to how we can cash in on our riches?\xc2\xa0 Specifically, the press I\xe2\x80\x99m told misreported this week that the Secretary of Energy said we should revisit bans from the \xe2\x80\x9870s on oil exports.\xc2\xa0 Now, whether or not he said it, it seems to me that would be a great idea of a way to raise money and close that fiscal gap.\xc2\xa0 What are you telling the President to do with this new energy we have?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 More broadly, when it comes to energy, as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in more production, we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in more renewables, we\xe2\x80\x99re also interested in helping people be more efficient in how they use that energy, and all those different parts of the equation have put us in a better position.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still a net importer of petroleum, but to a much lesser extent than we used to be, which has helped improve our overall trade balance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but even the \xe2\x80\x9call of the above\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense anymore because of natural gas.\xc2\xa0 We have such a huge supply, maybe a 40 or 50-year supply, that every year the renewables get less and less economically competitive vis-\xc3\xa0-vis natural gas.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, why are we still doing \xe2\x80\x9call of the above\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we focusing on natural gas and petroleum?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s two issues in energy.\xc2\xa0 One is, what are the direct market costs, and then what are the broader costs that energy consumption and use have for climate change in the future, for national security today.\xc2\xa0 And when you factor in all of those broader costs, the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation, for example, has been very helpful in terms of carbon emissions.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s still the case that renewables are even better when it comes to carbon emissions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why a balanced approach that takes advantage of all of these has a role.\xc2\xa0 And even with some of the price changes you just referred to, renewables are still very important when you take into account the total cost of all of these sources of energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, last one, all the way back, for Jason.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any analysis on the impact of not extending long-term unemployment benefit?\xc2\xa0 Is this just sort of personal tragedies, or could it affect the overall stickiness of the labor market there that you referred to earlier on, drawing people out of the mainstream?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So we, the Council of Economic Advisers, put out a report two weeks ago on the consequences of not extending unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the broader macroeconomic consequences, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the two highlights.\xc2\xa0 First, the purchasing power of people -- just the fact that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the benefits and thus wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to spend them -- we think is associated with 240,000 jobs over the next year.\xc2\xa0 CBO has had similar numbers in the past, and forecasters like CBO and J.P. Morgan have put the growth-rate effect at 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point off the growth rate in 2014.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a macroeconomic perspective on unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s also important to look -- in terms of its impact on aggregate demand, it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to look at the impact it has on workers and their search behavior.\xc2\xa0 And in that regard, there have been some important studies in recent years that have found one of the biggest effects it has is you can\xe2\x80\x99t get unemployment insurance if you\xe2\x80\x99re not looking for a job.\xc2\xa0 And when the economy is where it is today, it\xe2\x80\x99s great if somebody stays there, keeps trying, keeps working hard trying to find that job.\xc2\xa0 And the unemployment insurance extension encourages people to stay in the labor force, to continue looking for jobs.\xc2\xa0 And as the economy strengthens that will help employ some of those people.\xc2\xa0 So it has a good labor market effect in addition to that aggregate demand effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jason, we appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 I want to commend everyone for their intense interest in our chief economist.\xc2\xa0 I will stick around for questions on other subjects or continue the conversation on the economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNedra, I\'ll go back to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House square the review board\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the NSA\'s bulk telephone collection programs did not prevent a terrorist attack with the administration\'s assertions that they played a key role in preventing it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 Let me just begin from a higher altitude to say that, as you know, President Obama met with his Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies yesterday to discuss the report they submitted to the President on Friday, December 13th.\xc2\xa0 Following that meeting, as you know, we made the group\'s report public.\xc2\xa0 While the administration\'s internal review is ongoing, and this is only a piece of that review, we will not be in a position to comment on the individual proposals made by the review group.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut broadly speaking, it is our view that the report is thoughtful, comprehensive, and serious work.\xc2\xa0 The President appreciates the extraordinary effort that went into developing the report\'s 46 recommendations.\xc2\xa0 And beyond the one recommendation we have already made a determination on separately, we are open to all of these ideas.\xc2\xa0 Over the next several weeks, we will study the review group\'s report and determine which recommendations we should implement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs we do this, we will be making sure that we are focused on threats to the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear that even as we review our efforts, we will not -- we will not harm our national security or our ability to face global threats.\xc2\xa0 In January, the President looks forward to speaking to the American people, as well as to the international community to outline the outcomes of our work.\xc2\xa0 With regards to, again, the specific proposals, I\'m not going to run through them or comment on them, except to note the one where the decision had already been made in a separate process to maintain the leadership structure that exists at NSA and the Cyber Command.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will say that on the matters of recommendations to change the program, Section 215, without commenting on a specific recommendation, I\'d like to note that we have been clear that we believe this program is an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots.\xc2\xa0 But we also believe there are steps we can take to give the American people more confidence that there are additional safeguards against abuse.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has said that he believes we can take steps to put in place greater oversight, greater transparency, and constraints on the use of this authority.\xc2\xa0 And he directed us to work with the Congress to try to meet those objectives.\xc2\xa0 We have also said publicly that we are open to working with the Congress and others to consider proposals that would house the telephone data related to Section 215 at the providers or elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 Again, that relates to an element of what the review group\'s report discusses.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, I\'m not suggesting a yes-or-no answer to any specific proposal, but just reminding you of things that we\'ve said in the past, including that we would consider proposals that would house that metadata, the telephone metadata, at the providers or elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously some specific criteria that would need to be met for the program to stay effective under those circumstances, but it\'s certainly a question we have been studying.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that an accurate statement that the bulk telephone collection has not stopped a terrorist attack, or do you dispute that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we believe that it is an important tool.\xc2\xa0 The program is an important tool in our efforts to combat threats against the United States and the American people.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an assessment for every line in the review group\'s report, but we do believe that the program is important.\xc2\xa0 We also believe, the President believes that we can maintain the program and its effectiveness in helping us combat threats to the United States while making reforms to it.\xc2\xa0 And that is what he will be considering between now and January as we conclude our overall internal review.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that this report, along with a federal court decision this week, is shifting the debate toward putting some sort of limitations on these programs?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that the overall review, which includes this group that was set up and the PCLOB\'s efforts, as well as internal efforts that the President is undertaking with his team, reflects a view here that we can and should make changes that are consistent with our need to maintain security for the United States and the American people and our allies to combat the threats that exist, but that allow for us to provide more assurance to the American people that there are safeguards against abuse and that there is oversight in place so that they can have more insight into these programs and why they\'re necessary and how they\'re run.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s the sort of approach that the President has taken.\xc2\xa0 Again, we are -- with the exception of the one recommendation from the review group that in a separate process has already been decided and acted on, we are open to all the remaining 45.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we will be very deliberate in assessing the substantive and important work that the review group has done, and making decisions about which ones should be acted on and in what way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when those decisions are made, the President will speak to them in January.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSteve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry is saying he regrets the handling of this case involving the Indian diplomat in New York.\xc2\xa0 But the U.S. Attorney in the case is defending what happened.\xc2\xa0 Is there a mixed message here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We have an obviously very important and close relationship with India and the Indian government.\xc2\xa0 And the circumstances of the arrest are being reviewed, and I don\'t have any update on that process.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the Department of Justice, and in terms of our diplomatic relationships to the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Twenty-six senators on the Hill have introduced legislation to implement new sanctions on Iran if the interim deal is violated.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that you can live with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in regular, very direct conversations with members of Congress on this subject, and have made very clear to them that we do not believe now is the time to pass any additional new sanctions through Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith regards to this particular measure, we don\'t think it will be enacted.\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\'t think it should be enacted.\xc2\xa0 And the reason why it should not and does not need to be enacted is because if Iran does not comply with its obligations under the Joint Plan of Action, the preliminary agreement, or if Iran fails to reach agreement with the P5-plus-1 on the more comprehensive agreement over the course of six months, we are very confident that we can work with Congress to very quickly pass new, effective sanctions against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And it is our view that it is very important to refrain from taking an action that would potentially disrupt the opportunity here for a diplomatic resolution of this challenge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we don\'t want to see actions that would proactively undermine American diplomacy, which is what we fear that actions like passing new sanctions -- no matter how they\'re structured -- would be received, both by our international partners and obviously by Iran.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, coming back to this NSA program, the President in June said, talking about the metadata collection program, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve saved lives.\xc2\xa0 We know of at least 50 threats that have been averted because of this information, so lives have been saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So the question is, does the President still believe that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does still believe and knows that this program is an important piece of the overall efforts that we engage in to combat threats against the lives of American citizens and threats to our overall national security, as well as threats to the lives and security of allies and allied nations, as I mentioned earlier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to parse or respond to every sentence of I believe a 300-plus page report that the review group produced, except to say that with the exception of the one recommendation that\'s already been acted on in a separate process, all 45 in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view and our view merit serious consideration.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to spending time reviewing that report and working with the other elements involved in the overall internal review to reach conclusions about what reforms we can put in place, what changes we can make.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about that in January once he\xe2\x80\x99s made those decisions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, I didn\'t ask you about the report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you specifically about what the President said in June when he said that this data collection program has averted --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that, yes, the President believes that this program is part of a broader effort --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about part of a broader.\xc2\xa0 He said, information --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it is part of a broader, obviously.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the many efforts that we engage in to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if he is standing by what he said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So 50 threats have been -- that seems to be in direct contradiction to the report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- well, again, I know, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked clearly to be understood that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to respond to a line-by-line assessment of the report, or make a line-by-line assessment of the report, except to say that the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important piece of work that he asked for and that he looks forward to reviewing it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is absolutely his view and our view that this program contributes to our national security and contributes to combating threats against the lives of American citizens and the lives of allies and allied -- and the security of allied nations.\xc2\xa0 So having said that, as I mentioned earlier, there are areas where we have already talked about potential reforms or changes to the program.\xc2\xa0 And we are open to and want to review all of the recommendations that the review group has made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you understand what I -- I understand you cannot go line by line --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there\xe2\x80\x99s any other way that I can answer the question, Jon.\xc2\xa0 I said that we stand by what we said in the past.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to our national security.\xc2\xa0 We are open to reforms to the program.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that steps are taken to provide more demonstrated assurance to the American people about these programs, and demonstrated assurance that there is additional oversight and protections against abuse.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President looks forward to addressing in January.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on your description of the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest in going through the recommendations thoroughly, and the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s going on vacation, can you describe a little bit more or be more transparent about the system or the process that he\xe2\x80\x99s set up to actually go through this?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean how will he turn the pages when he reads the report?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what do you mean exactly?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll read the report and assess them and talk -- have, as he has had for quite some time now, conversations with his national security team.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what I was interested in is because he wants to give this careful attention, has he assigned Lisa Monaco while he\xe2\x80\x99s away to be heading an interagency process to do this?\xc2\xa0 Will he be working with his staff in Hawaii while he\xe2\x80\x99s looking over this, among many other issues that he\xe2\x80\x99s been thinking about for January?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is his advisor on counterterrorism is already very much a part of this review, and she has been directly engaged in it, as have other members of his national security team.\xc2\xa0 And the answer is, without a specific tasking to describe, yes, everybody involved in this effort will continue to work on it between now and January when the President has made decisions about how he wants to move forward and will address the American people about those decisions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo yes, absolutely, that work continues from now through January, and that includes through the next several weeks, both at the presidential level and at the level of principals on the national security team, including Lisa Monaco.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The President also has another review report coming up on election reform.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates on where that stands?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Gary Locke, the current ambassador to China; John Huntsman, former ambassador -- both had strong ties to the country.\xc2\xa0 Why is Senator Max Baucus qualified to serve as ambassador to China, acknowledging that he has worked on trade with China?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no personnel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen reports, so I would just urge you to wait until we have a personnel announcement to make.\xc2\xa0 I would generally say that Senator Baucus has been directly engaged for more than two decades in work to deepen the relationship between the United States and China, and that includes efforts to level the playing field in our trade relationships as well as efforts to open markets and increase trade, and to bring China into the World Trade Organization, and to establish permanent, normal trade relations with China.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that just happens to occur to me when it comes to -- (laughter) -- some of the work that Senator Baucus has done in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, when we have personnel announcements, we make them.\xc2\xa0 So when we have one, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if the President were to announce that he was appointing Senator Baucus as ambassador to China, to what extent would there be a political calculation in that, given that such an appointment could help to keep his Senate seat in Democratic hands?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make about a personnel matter that is the President\xe2\x80\x99s to make.\xc2\xa0 And when he has one to make, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll answer questions about it when it happens, whatever the personnel announcement is -- whether it has to do with an ambassadorship or something else.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far down the road.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to generally respond that Senator Baucus has done certainly a substantial amount of work on U.S.-China relations over the past several decades.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see keeping his seat in Democratic hands as critical to Democrats holding onto the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to ask this in the context of a rumored personnel announcement.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a confirmation for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask you about Syria, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The crisis there seems to be growing worse by the day, particularly for the refugees, the people who have been displaced, the children.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a specific plan for helping those people who have been displaced?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just asking about aid.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a broader plan to help those people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me be clear, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know, that the United States is the single largest provider of assistance to the Syrian people, and we will continue to be, and we will continue to work with our partners and allies in the effort to assist in what is a terrible humanitarian situation brought about by the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s brutal war on its own people.\xc2\xa0 And Assad has a remarkable amount of Syrian blood on his hands.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, it remains our view that he has no future in Syria.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a brutal dictator whose actions have led to a conflict that has resulted in over 100,000 deaths as well as the humanitarian situation that you described.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a dictator whose regime has overseen the gassing of its own people with chemical weapons and a dictator whose forces continue today to drop barrel bombs on innocent civilians in Aleppo and to block international efforts to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance to millions of beleaguered Syrians.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe continue to press forward on an international effort to meet in Geneva to move a process forward that would result in a transitional government and a negotiated, political resolution to this conflict.\xc2\xa0 There is only one way out of this conflict, and that\xe2\x80\x99s through negotiated resolution.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re pressing so hard on the Geneva II front with our partners and allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think, as so many journalists who have reported on the situation there, that the situation is actually getting worse?\xc2\xa0 And if he does, does that then suggest that he needs to think about a new policy towards Syria?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve described our approach and why we think it\xe2\x80\x99s so --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think the situation is getting worse?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that with some of the weather that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, that the specific situation -- humanitarian situation in some areas has gotten worse.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that as Assad deploys weapons like barrel bombs against his own people, that that situation continues to worsen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, there has been ebbs and flows in that conflict, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I have a broader assessment.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that it remains the case that Assad is brutalizing his own people.\xc2\xa0 And it remains the case that we need to push forward on a process that produces a political resolution to the conflict, a transitional government, and a government in which -- the composition of which the Syrian people must decide and the Syrian people have made clear that Assad cannot be part of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tVoice of America, then Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on the Syria question.\xc2\xa0 As we prepare for this conference in January, does that mean the position remains the same that Assad cannot have a role going forward in that transitional --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have always been clear that it is for the Syrian people to determine which members of the regime they can work with, and the Syrian people have made clear that Assad cannot have a part of the future of Syria, and we share that view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another follow-up on Iran.\xc2\xa0 The Russian foreign minister said in Poland, where of course the interceptors are supposed to be located under the missile shield, that implementation of the Geneva agreement on Iran will remove the cause for construction of a missile shield in Europe.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to that comment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that comment.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our position on that has not changed, and an interim agreement is not a comprehensive agreement and it is not a resolution to the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly have -- there is no change in our posture with regards to a missile defense program in Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Is it your contention that the five-member panel, though steeped in and experienced in counterintelligence surveillance and other national security issues, simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know things the President knows about what has been achieved through parts of the surveillance program under his watch?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, I simply have no more specific response to a single assertion in the report.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that the President is responsible for the creation of the review board.\xc2\xa0 The President is grateful for the work that the members did individually and collectively.\xc2\xa0 And he takes their work so seriously that we are making clear that every one of the 45 remaining recommendations in that report merit serious consideration.\xc2\xa0 And that is what they will get, as will other recommendations coming from elsewhere.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But surely he must appreciate that, yes, it\'s a 308-page report, but average Americans looking at it and seeing an assertion by a panel of this experienced career-long involvement in national security issues saying they\'re not certain and they wonder if these programs have successfully prevented any loss of life or thwarted anything and the President contending, as Jon said, on the record -- not only has it thwarted, but its saved lives -- that he -- I mean, I\'m just asking you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you\'re asking me and Jon asked me, and I don\'t have any new answers to give you than I gave you five minutes ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I can tell you is the President believes that this program is an important component of our effort to thwart the threats against the United States and the American people.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case that reforms to it and the general signal intelligence collection effort that we engage in are entirely appropriate to consider and implement.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this process is about.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t forget that the overall review here that involves the review group, it involves PCLOB and other aspects is one that the President pushed for and that the President will have something to say about in January once he has made some decisions about how to move forward on these recommendations, as well as others.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve described that metadata collection and other parts of signals intelligence is one tool.\xc2\xa0 Another thing that was identified in the report that has been a longstanding tool since 9/11 is national -- NSL, National Security Letters, from the FBI.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of what they use in many counterterrorism investigations.\xc2\xa0 And that was also subject to some scrutiny by the panel and some very specific reviews, limiting them -- more core supervision, more specific transparency involved with those.\xc2\xa0 Are those recommendations, which sort of cut much more closely to operational, day-to-day sort of boots-on-the-ground FBI counterterrorism investigations, something the administration will take equally as seriously?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, without addressing any specific recommendation, I can tell you that all 45 are being given and will be given serious consideration.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to do the work that still needs to be done within the ongoing internal review process and provide determinations on each specific recommendation today, except to say that there is not a single recommendation that in the President\'s view does not merit serious consideration.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he\'ll give it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEd.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about what Vladimir Putin said at his year-end press conference today about Edward Snowden, since he took several questions on Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 He said, "I\'ve never met him.\xc2\xa0 He has his own views about life, about what he should do and how.\xc2\xa0 I won\'t hide it that he seems very interesting to me," Putin said of Snowden.\xc2\xa0 "I\'ve already said that and will say once again in an almost professional language that from the intelligence point of view, we do not work with him and have never worked with him.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t bug him with all those questions as to what was being done in relation to Russia or how it was being done at the agency he worked for."\xc2\xa0 Do you believe any of those assertions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see the press conference, Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just read it to you verbatim.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But not in the original.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you read it back to me in the original, I\'ll shut up.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is that our views on Mr. Snowden have not changed.\xc2\xa0 And our views on the damage caused by the disclosure of highly sensitive, classified information have not changed, and that he has been charged with felonies, and he ought to be returned to the United States and face those charges here in the United States where he will be accorded all due process and protections.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s my only response.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to Iran.\xc2\xa0 You say new sanctions could undermine the negotiations on a nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 It could blow it up.\xc2\xa0 Can you see, though, why Democratic as well as Republican senators are now saying on the Hill these sanctions would not take effect for months?\xc2\xa0 They wouldn\'t take effect until after talks broke down.\xc2\xa0 So how would that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, our view is there is no need.\xc2\xa0 It is entirely unnecessary to potentially disrupt, or derail entirely, diplomacy if the only purpose is to assert that you\'ll impose new sanctions later when we are 100 percent confident that if Iran were not to comply with its obligations under the preliminary agreement or were to fail to reach agreement on a comprehensive agreement, that we would be able to work with Congress to enact new sanctions with great dispatch.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, because we have seen in Congress a very effective partner in the past in building the most effective sanctions regime against Iran in history, we believe it is unnecessary to take action now that is more appropriately reserved for a time when new sanctions might be needed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except the Democratic Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee disagrees with what you just said.\xc2\xa0 Bob Menendez gives the President credit for the current sanctions he says brought Iran to the table.\xc2\xa0 But then he goes on to say, "A credible threat of future sanctions will require Iran to cooperate."\xc2\xa0 How is Democratic Chairman Bob Menendez wrong?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\'t think this action is necessary.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t think it will be enacted.\xc2\xa0 If it were enacted the President would veto it.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is this is not a debate about being for or against sanctions.\xc2\xa0 There is no President in the history of this conflict with Iran who has been more aggressive in pursuing and enacting and building international consensus around sanctions than Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he has done that, not to take credit for the construction of a sanctions regime, but in order to test the theory that a comprehensive sanctions regime would compel Iran to change its behavior, would compel Iran to come to the negotiating table and would give us -- the United States and our P5-plus-1 partners, the opportunity to explore whether we can resolve this conflict diplomatically; that we can reach an agreement with Iran that would ensure that Iran gave up its nuclear weapons ambitions in a transparent, verifiable way; and that we would therefore resolve this diplomatically without having to pursue other means.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, this is not -- there is no debate here about -- this is not a dispute about who is for sanctions and who is against sanctions.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s record on the use of sanctions for the broader purpose here is quite clear.\xc2\xa0 What we firmly believe is that we know that Congress could act quickly if Iran were to fail to comply.\xc2\xa0 I believe Iran knows that, because they have seen Congress act quickly in the past when sanctions were necessary.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe believe that it\'s important to allow this diplomatic opening to be explored.\xc2\xa0 And the risk of passing new sanctions now is that it would -- doing so would derail the negotiations just when diplomacy is making progress.\xc2\xa0 It would potentially divide the international community, and obviously would suggest bad faith on the part of the United States in its negotiations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, isn\'t it hypocritical for the administration to say future sanctions by Congress, Democrats and Republicans doing it, could undermine these negotiations?\xc2\xa0 And yet this very week your own Treasury Department came out with not new sanctions, but new enforcement actions that angered Iran.\xc2\xa0 And you have Democrats as well as Republicans saying you\'ve already angered them.\xc2\xa0 That could blow off the talks too.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, you know the very important distinction between enforcement of existing sanctions, on the one hand, and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'re not new sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, enforcement of existing sanctions on the one hand, which we clearly stated in the run-up to and the completion of the preliminary agreement with the P5-plus-1 would continue and were not part of any agreement with Iran in this preliminary stage on the one hand, and the imposition of new sanctions on the other.\xc2\xa0 You\'re right that there was some reaction to the enforcement of those existing sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But the members of the Iranian leadership also acknowledged that they were not new sanctions, and there was no prohibition in the agreement against the implementation of existing sanctions, which is what was the case here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that that action makes clear how serious we are about maintaining the existing sanctions structure and continuing to implement the existing sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What we do not believe is necessary and what we believe could be damaging and disruptive to the diplomatic effort here are new sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So very last one on this then.\xc2\xa0 All the cases you just made very passionately, and the President has made -- I understand some of his top aides have been calling Democratic senators, urging them not to do this; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some of the top Democrats -- Schumer, Pryor, Landrieu, Casey and Menendez, as I mentioned, Democratic Chairman -- several top Democrats are saying no.\xc2\xa0 What does that say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s standing with his own party right now that they\'re defying him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there is overwhelming support in the country and in the Congress for a diplomatic resolution to this conflict.\xc2\xa0 It is the far preferable choice that we resolve this challenge with Iran with our international allies diplomatically, peacefully -- even as we leave all options for resolving it on the table, including the use of military force.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is absolutely his responsibility, the President believes, to fully test whether we can achieve a comprehensive solution through diplomatic means and before he -- and to fully test that proposition before he pursues alternatives.\xc2\xa0 And passing new sanctions legislation now will undermine our efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution and greatly increase the chances that the United States would have to take military action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, let me just back up to where I started:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t believe this proposal is necessary -- as I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, and we have been discussing with members of Congress for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t believe it will be enacted.\xc2\xa0 We certainly know it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary.\xc2\xa0 If it were to pass, the President would veto it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because of -- the case we just made we believe is both accurate and persuasive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBrianna.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve learned this week Paul Ryan said Republicans will consider what they want in exchange for increasing the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I know the stance of the White House is not to negotiate, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the last couple of times the debt ceiling has been increased it has been I guess done so not necessarily with a condition, but prompting a process -- whether it was that the Senate would take up -- the Senate would pass a budget, or in this case that the House and the Senate would go to conference on a budget.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I guess in this case, on the debt ceiling, is the White House open not necessarily to conditions -- although some people would call them that -- but to sort of maybe spurring a process where the debt ceiling --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any objective view of what happened in October that conflicts with our absolute assertion that the President will not negotiate over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s right and responsibility to pay its bills.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the end deal that was brokered prompting a process.\xc2\xa0 Last winter we saw a process was prompted of the Senate has to pass a budget.\xc2\xa0 The debt ceiling is increased not necessarily contingent if --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a variety of ways that Congress can act to fulfill its responsibility, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has not and will not change.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit about this, this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI understand that some comments have been made this week by some Republicans that seem to suggest they want to threaten default again.\xc2\xa0 I am still of the view that those handful of comments do not yet outweigh the overwhelming number of comments in the wake of the shutdown and the last time they threatened default and all of the negative consequences of that action.\xc2\xa0 And those comments reflected a view in the Republican Party, including among its leaders in Congress, that they would not pursue that course again.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the former statements outweigh the current ones, and we will see what happens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe certainly will not change our position.\xc2\xa0 And it boggles the mind to think that when we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen just in the last several months what the consequences of that kind of brinksmanship are in the shutdown and the threat of default in October, versus the effects and consequences of bipartisan cooperation in the budget agreement that was reached by Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo on the one hand, you can take action that does harm to the economy and harm to the middle class in pursuit of some ideological objective that might help you in your primary, or you can take action as Congress did -- and Republicans and Democrats deserve credit for this -- that actually contributes to economic growth and job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, that budget deal that you hail wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been possible without the Senate putting out a budget, which was in a way a condition of increasing the debt ceiling last --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no, no, that\'s not true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It pushed -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a condition.\xc2\xa0 I get what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0 The debt ceiling would have been increased whether or not they put a budget through, but it spurred a process.\xc2\xa0 So are you open to something --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- well, I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- I mean, a way to say that is that when the decision by Republicans to -- with some excitement to shut down the government and threaten default turned out to be a disaster for them and not a \xe2\x80\x9cwinning strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d to quote Republican leaders, they were then compelled in the aftermath of that to instead approach this in a spirit of compromise and bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 And that produced the agreement that we saw.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to see if there is that -- is there in a way some sort of exchange where they get something but it doesn\'t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re asking me to negotiate, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- the President is not, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not.\xc2\xa0 I really don\'t believe that the Republican Party would -- and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence that they won\xe2\x80\x99t want to go down that road again.\xc2\xa0 I certainly hope that\'s the case for the sake of the economy and the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New Mexico Supreme Court has ruled that the state may not deny same-sex couples the freedom to marry, becoming I believe the 17th state to do that.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not official reaction.\xc2\xa0 I would say that we welcome that ruling, and this is another example of the extraordinary progress that\'s been made when it comes to equal rights for LGBT Americans in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJared.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, you said that the administration has been having direct conversations with lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been talking to Senators Menendez and Schumer and Cardin --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has certainly been involved in the effort.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- and then that means in discussions with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific conversation or meeting to read out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the first time he I guess potentially would -- I realize this is a hypothetical -- veto a bill that\'s been co-sponsored by Democrats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to look at the history.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not far from the first time where we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that if a bill were to pass, we would veto it -- the President would veto it.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know the answer to that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, even with the 13 pardons announced today, President Obama has granted far fewer pardons than nearly all of his predecessors over the last half century.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what his criteria for granting pardons are and how he would answer those critics who say he\xe2\x80\x99s been stingy with pardons?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that all of these cases are handled in the ordinary process through the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department makes recommendations to the President.<br/>\n\tCases are handled in the ordinary process through the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department makes recommendations to the President.\xc2\xa0 I, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, can confirm stories that today before the briefing, that as part of his ongoing effort to ensure federal law is enforced fairly, effectively, and efficiently, President Obama commuted the sentences of eight individuals who are serving unduly harsh sentences issued under an outdated sentencing regime.\xc2\xa0 He additionally made a number of pardons today as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are his criteria for granting pardons?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he reviews the recommendations made by the Department of Justice, and that process is undertaken through regular order.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the recommendations of the pardon attorney?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have more for you on this.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 The President, again, reviews the recommendations of the Department of Justice, the pardon attorney, under the leadership of the Attorney General.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAndrei.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Putin said today that he envies President Obama, his ability to basically get away with anything, including the stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s been revealed by Mr. Snowden that was under contest.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the original either, Andrei.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe it was in a half-joking manner, but it\xe2\x80\x99s serious.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Regrettably, I did not see President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s press conference and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment specifically.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to Edward Snowden, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d make clear again what our view is.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the ongoing review into our signals intelligence collection, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to that I think pretty thoroughly today.\xc2\xa0 So since those comments that you cited back to me have to do with those issues, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President envy President Putin -- his ability to say publicly whatever he wants?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that what\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable about this country is that anybody can say what he or she wants about the government and about -- and to peacefully protest without retribution, consequence.\xc2\xa0 And, for example, to protest or highlight corruption in government, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that democratic societies treasure and we certainly do here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when we read in the press that the President complains privately to his aides that he not always can say what he wants publicly, that\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe everything you read in the press.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many times when he speaks to the press, takes questions from the press, speaks very freely about his policy views and his opinions on matters of the day and of the future, and he enjoys that very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when is the President going to sign the budget bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a process that has to take place, but obviously he looks forward to signing it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be before he leaves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Press conference tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 See you later.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:25 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
