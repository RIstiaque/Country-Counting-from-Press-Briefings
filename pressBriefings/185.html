EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Welcome aboard Air Force One, everyone, en route to Charleston, West Virginia, where the President will host a community panel about local, state and federal efforts, as well as private sector initiatives to address the drug abuse epidemic. \xc2\xa0This event will be moderated by the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Michael Botticelli, and will include questions solicited from the Charleston Gazette-Mail readers, and read by their publisher.</p>\n<p>\n\tI won\xe2\x80\x99t spend too much time walking through the actions announced by the President. \xc2\xa0You all have the factsheets, and I know we did a conference call earlier, but I do want to just make clear that this is work that\xe2\x80\x99s been built -- today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is the latest in steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over the past six and a half years to stem the tide of drug addiction and overdose, starting with the release of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national drug control strategy in 2010. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s also very important pieces of the Affordable Care Act that deal with substance abuse, and so I would urge you, when you\xe2\x80\x99re joined by Republicans who want to roll back and repeal the Affordable Care Act, to ask what they would do to replace specifically the provisions that deal with a lot of the issues we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be talking about today.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, can you go to the news of the day? \xc2\xa0Will you describe exactly when the President learned of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, and in much detail as you can describe his reaction and whether or not he thought he made the right choice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Whether or not what?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He made the right choice.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kathleen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to unpack the private communications between the President and the Vice President, but I will say a couple of different things about the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say I think most recently on 60 Minutes, the President believes Joe Biden has been one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever seen, and he is very glad to have him by his side for the next 15 months. \xc2\xa0As you heard the President say many times in the past year, we have a lot of work left to do, and that work is going to be made a lot easier having the Vice President as his partner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and Vice President have a very close relationship. \xc2\xa0They have lunch every week. \xc2\xa0And over the last few months, the President has been there for his friend largely to serve as a sounding board. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not just as he copes with unspeakable loss, but also as he makes very personal decisions about his political future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President endorse someone in the Democratic primary? \xc2\xa0Does this change that calculus at all, now that the Vice President is out of the race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it changes the calculus. \xc2\xa0I think the President said in the Rose Garden a few days ago that he will be casting a ballot in the Illinois primary, and it will be up to him whether he decides to share his vote with you or not. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, to be clear, were you saying that the President advised the Vice President on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think the President served as a sounding board, much in the same way that the Vice President has served as a sounding board for the President as he grappled with issues over the past seven years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Obama has talked about using drugs when he was in high school. \xc2\xa0Has that had any impact on how he\xe2\x80\x99s come up with his policies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear from the President today share less about his experience but more listening to members of the audience, and at the panel talk, about what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to deal with this issue in real time, right now, in one of the communities that\xe2\x80\x99s being significantly impacted by it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the people who were there, a lot of them have been personally affected. \xc2\xa0Botticelli has been, a lot of the people in the room have been. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- hasn\xe2\x80\x99t that had an impact on how he sees drugs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I can tell you that Director Botticelli does have a very compelling personal story, and he has talked about that with the President. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if that comes up today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about drugs? \xc2\xa0Has he smoked pot at the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can we circle back to Joe Biden and the timing on this? \xc2\xa0Because I know the President and Vice President had lunch yesterday. \xc2\xa0Was the President aware that this announcement was going to come today? \xc2\xa0And obviously this happened in the Rose Garden, so there had to be some sort of planning involved from the White House perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure, Kristen. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to be in a position to detail the private communications between the President and the Vice President. \xc2\xa0As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a longstanding policy that that weekly lunch that the President and Vice President have been having regularly for the past seven years is sacrosanct, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out those conversations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say that the bottom line for the President was this was a personal decision that the Vice President had to make, and he had to make it on his own terms. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is that something that the President learned about today, yesterday? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out the private communications the two of them have had.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to be clear, Eric, the Vice President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been allowed to announce that he was running in the Rose Garden of the White House, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think that would have been a first if it were to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would that have been allowed? \xc2\xa0Would that have been ethical in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0We have a lot of events in the Rose Garden, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen someone launch a presidential campaign there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a reason the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak today, or say something about the Vice President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think this was the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, can you tell us the White House response to Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s trip to meet with President Putin, and the news that has been coming out of that about -- can you give us a response to that trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure, Julia. \xc2\xa0We are aware of this travel. \xc2\xa0We view the red carpet welcome for Assad, who has used chemical weapons against his own people, as at odds with the stated goal by the Russians for a political transition in Syria. \xc2\xa0But for us, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change anything about the situation in Syria. \xc2\xa0We still believe that Russia propping up Assad after he\xe2\x80\x99s turned his country into a civil war, after allowing extremists to flourish, and creating the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II is only exacerbated by welcoming President Assad to Moscow.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe urge Russia to use its influence with the Syrian regime to press for a political transition, because we know right now what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is counterproductive.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has Russia hit a single ISIS target in Syria yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated matrix for you on that. \xc2\xa0I would check with the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0It is very clear that what they are hitting have generally not been ISIS targets. \xc2\xa0But you should refer -- you should check in with my colleagues at the Pentagon who can get you the latest assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, on the fight against ISIS, the Canadian Prime Minister-elect yesterday in a press conference said that he told President Obama in their phone call that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to withdraw air support for the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a further readout from that call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kristen, as we did indicate in the readout we released yesterday of their brief telephone call last night, President Obama and Prime Minister-designate Trudeau committed in general terms to strengthening their countries\xe2\x80\x99 joint efforts to combat terrorism. \xc2\xa0And that does include that threat posed by ISIL. \xc2\xa0We expect Canada will continue to be a valuable contributor to the 65-member global coalition whose mission is to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. \xc2\xa0Nevertheless, it is important to note that the leaders did not discuss the specifics of strategy and tactics in any detail whatsoever. \xc2\xa0Those conversations will likely take place in greater depth once the Prime Minister-designate takes office both at the head-of-state level and with our counterparts in the Canadian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been more than five years since President Obama traveled to West Virginia, and the last time it was for the funeral of Senator Byrd. \xc2\xa0What does the President expect his response to be like in West Virginia? \xc2\xa0And is the reason why he stayed away because of his policies on coal and the response that he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten from West Virginians on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Julia. \xc2\xa0This is a community -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say this drug abuse epidemic is unique to this area, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also an issue that has significantly impacted this area. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President wanted to come to West Virginia.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the declining coal jobs in West Virginia began well before this President took office. \xc2\xa0Historically, and as economists will tell you, that job loss was the result of consolidation in the coal industry. \xc2\xa0But more important than the reasons behind that job loss, the President does care deeply about the impact of that on the community. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why in his budget request this year to Congress he included a POWER Plus plan, which targets billions of dollars of strategic investments in economic development and resources for coal communities. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we started a POWER initiative earlier this year, using available funds, which actually just awarded investments last week to community-based partnership in this state that will sustain and create jobs in the industry sectors. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell, as well as Senator Manchin, was speaking to us just a minute ago. \xc2\xa0He mentioned legislative moves that could build upon the announcements that Obama is making today on heroin use. \xc2\xa0As you know, Senator McConnell from Kentucky, also Appalachia states, going through a lot of these same problems. \xc2\xa0Is there any coordination already underway between the White House and this bipartisan group to advance legislation that may address the heroin epidemic?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Julia, a lot of -- unfortunately, a lot of what happens in Washington is done along party lines these days. \xc2\xa0This is one issue that crosses the aisle. \xc2\xa0And we are heartened by Republicans and Democrats coming together to work on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know there\xe2\x80\x99s a myriad of proposals in Congress that tackle this issue. \xc2\xa0This is definitely something that we are working hard on. \xc2\xa0We appreciate Senator Manchin\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on the issue, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with them. \xc2\xa0It is worth noting that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget included a request for $133 million in new investments to address this epidemic. \xc2\xa0This is money that would go towards programs that we know will make a difference, including state-based overdose prevention programs, medication-assisted treatment programs, and access to the overdose reversal drug for first responders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just what she was saying about West Virginia -- like, people in West Virginia, they say they really hate Obama, probably because of the coal. \xc2\xa0So how is he prepared to talk to them? \xc2\xa0Has he thought about he\xe2\x80\x99s going to approach this? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty delicate --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to a thoughtful, careful, deliberative discussion today. \xc2\xa0I think the people you will see joining the President have been impacted firsthand by this problem. \xc2\xa0And I think that this epidemic is one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just affect people as individuals, but it can affect them in the workplace, it can shatter families, communities, schools. \xc2\xa0So this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s making this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s getting overshadowed by Biden\xe2\x80\x99s announcement today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did President Obama and Prime Minister-elect Justin Trudeau discuss Keystone yesterday during their phone call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details to read out of the call, other than what we shared earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now that the election is over, could we expect a wrap-up on Keystone sometime soon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0That was like, what, question 13, 14? \xc2\xa0Madeleine, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to share with you that this is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s under review at the State Department, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to that agency for where they are in their process. \xc2\xa0I would note that Secretary Kerry spoke, I believe yesterday morning, and said that both the timing of the Canadian election and the outcome would have no bearing on the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, would you offer us any preview of the meeting with Democrats tonight, what the President would like to accomplish, what the message might be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0The President will be hosting a number of House and Senate Democrats who have played important roles on the issue of trade. \xc2\xa0These were individuals who helped pass the President\xe2\x80\x99s Trade Promotion Authority earlier this year. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing that issue amongst others at the White House. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of interest in TPP. \xc2\xa0That text is not yet available, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for us to say Congress should pass anything before that happens. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure those will be issues that are discussed tonight.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will they be offered some sort of a preview of the text?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that. \xc2\xa0But I do think they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss a lot of the issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will you release who\xe2\x80\x99s coming exactly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I will see what I can do. \xc2\xa0Usually we leave that up to the members\xe2\x80\x99 offices.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the White House reached out, or is planning to reach out to Paul Ryan? \xc2\xa0And anything they want to say about the race for Speaker, considering there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of big items, including TPP, but the debt ceiling coming up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Yes, Kristen. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls to read out to you. \xc2\xa0But as you know, Paul Ryan is a respected leader in the Republican caucus for several years now. \xc2\xa0He was obviously a member of the Republican ticket in 2012. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s someone who the President believes has given considerable thought to the significant issues that must be worked through in Washington. \xc2\xa0On some, even, he\xe2\x80\x99s worked with Democrats, like trade and on immigration. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of issues where we have vastly different approaches.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth observing that -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of time and attention paid to uniting the fractious Republican conference in the House, and we hope that\xe2\x80\x99s not a precursor for someone who wants to attempt to govern on a strictly partisan basis. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s two reasons for that. \xc2\xa0One, we have a divided government in Washington right now, so success only happens when Democrats and Republicans work together. \xc2\xa0And second, we have seen the House Republican leadership try and only work amongst themselves, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that not end well. \xc2\xa0So we hope that whoever is the next Speaker assumes that role with a willingness to work with Democrats, and not just those in Congress, but also in the administration as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go too much into detail on conversations between the President and the Vice President, but could you just give us a sense of why this timeframe? \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing for months now what he\xe2\x80\x99s considering, and the President has been involved in that. \xc2\xa0Can you give us a sense of what took so long for the Vice President to decide where he was at in this conversation? \xc2\xa0And how long was the President involved in those deliberations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Julia, for us it\xe2\x80\x99s been a bedrock principle that -- and this comes from the President\xe2\x80\x99s directive, which is the Vice President is going to make this decision on his own terms, giving him the time and space he needed by which to do so. \xc2\xa0I think -- although you all were on the plane, but hopefully you were able to catch it on television. \xc2\xa0In the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, he spoke very compellingly about his process and how he decided to come to this conclusion. \xc2\xa0But if you have questions about his timing or the sequencing of that decision, you should probably check with the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President and Vice President began these conversations when? \xc2\xa0July, June, this spring? \xc2\xa0When did the Vice President start seeking the President\xe2\x80\x99s advice on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to read out those private conversations, but if you have questions about when the Vice President commenced this process, you should probably check in with my colleagues in his office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. \xc2\xa0On the \xe2\x80\x9cclock kid,\xe2\x80\x9d so if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, he is leaving the country and returning to the Middle East, to Qatar, presumably because he feels he has more opportunity there. \xc2\xa0Does the President know this? \xc2\xa0Does he have any response? \xc2\xa0Does the White House regret inviting him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I haven\'t spoken to the President about this, but I did see those reports. \xc2\xa0I think Ahmed enjoyed his time at the White House in the Rose Garden for Astronomy Night. \xc2\xa0He was one of about 300 folks that we had in the Rose Garden. \xc2\xa0That included other students, scientists, astronomers, parents, educators. \xc2\xa0And I do know that they got to share a few brief words as the President worked the rope line at the conclusion of the event.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Anything else we should know about West Virginia? \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to go to the school. \xc2\xa0Will we see anything else? \xc2\xa0Or anything else we should keep in mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think you are in store for a thoughtful --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A coal mine? \xc2\xa0Are we going to go to a coal mine?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0We will just be at that school this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:43 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
