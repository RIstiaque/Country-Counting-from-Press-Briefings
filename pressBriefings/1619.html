EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased today to be joined by Melody Barnes, the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council; Alan Solomont, the Chair for the Corporation for National and Community Service; and Stephen Goldsmith, Vice Chair of the Corporation for National and Community Service.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing the service bill that the President will be signing today, including some of the initiatives that it will help support.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll give you additional background on that, as well.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So without further ado, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn it over to Melody to start the call.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks so much, Jen.\xc2\xa0 And good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 We are really pleased that you could join us for this call.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\xe2\x80\x99m going to provide just a brief overview and then turn the call over to Alan Solomont, who is chairman of the board directors for the Corporation for National and Community Service, as well as Stephen Goldsmith, who is the vice chairman.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to take your questions and engage in more of a dialogue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think as all of you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re excited that this afternoon the President will sign into law the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.\xc2\xa0 And this is, for those of you who have followed national service for a period of time, the most sweeping expansion of national service programs in many, many years, as well as a reauthorization.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in Washington for well over 15 years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on the Hill for well over 10, and I think for those of you who have worked in Washington or followed Congress, that we could probably all agree that this was a speedy passage of the bill after the President called for the legislation in his first address to a joint session of Congress.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And just to give you all a sense of that, he called for passage of this legislation on February 25th, and then House Education and Labor Chairman George Miller introduced the bill on March 8th.\xc2\xa0 He and the Ranking Member moved it quickly to the floor where it passed by a large bipartisan vote on March 18th.\xc2\xa0 The Senate quickly followed suit and the bill passed overwhelmingly there by a 79-19 margin on March 26th.\xc2\xa0 And then the House eventually passed the Senate bill for final passage on March 31st.\xc2\xa0 So that all happened in just over three weeks, or 22 days.\xc2\xa0 And it also happened in a bipartisan fashion, with Senators Hatch and Enzi, as well as Representatives Miller, McKeon, Berman, McCarthy, Senator Cochran and others.\xc2\xa0 So it was a big bipartisan victory.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And we think that that happened because there are so many people both in -- and members of Congress, as well as around the country, who believe in the impact of national service and the fact that service can be a solution to some of the tough problems that are facing our nation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that the President has spoken about.\xc2\xa0 And he started his call around nation service publicly during the course of the campaign when he talked about the fact that government cannot be a solution to all of our problems, and we have to work together.\xc2\xa0 He wanted to empower Americans to work alongside the government to solve our education and health care, energy independence problems and challenges.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also reflected in the fact that, as he and the First Lady described, this is a part of their background, and certainly national service and his work as a community organizer was a pivotal point in his career and has really helped to shape his life and his perspective on government, as well as the role of national service organizations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">One of the other things that I would like to point out, as many of you probably remember during the Inauguration, the President made a call for national service on Martin Luther King Day.\xc2\xa0 We had an overwhelming response to that call; whereas in the past we\xe2\x80\x99ve had 5,000 projects take place on that day, this year there were over 13,000 projects that took place, and that was the largest ever turnout in the 14 years that -- since Congress has encouraged Americans to observe the King holiday as a national day of service.</div> <div class="legacy-para">One of the things that we want to do in going forward after the President has signed the legislation today is to support this work and these efforts through his budget.\xc2\xa0 And as some of you may know, his 2010 budget reflects his commitment to service and it requests a $1.1 billion for the corporation, which is about a 25 percent increase over last year.\xc2\xa0 And this is also building upon the service stimulus that was in the Recovery Act, which was a $200 million sum for AmeriCorps, to support their members as we were trying to help distressed communities during the -- as we put together the Recovery Act legislation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I would just close by saying that we really believe that this is just the beginning; that there are a number of exciting expansions and new commitments that exist in the legislation that will be signed today; and that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to working with Congress and building on the bipartisan support; and that that will be reflected in the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to the country today, as he encourages more Americans to stand up, to participate and to engage and help to change history through their efforts in their communities and through national service organizations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And with that, I will turn this over to Alan, who will talk a little bit more about the corporation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Melody, and thanks to all for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 I am Alan Solomont and I chair the board of directors of the Corporation for National Community Service.\xc2\xa0 The corporation is a federal agency.\xc2\xa0 It was created in 1993 -- actually, legislation creating the corporation was signed on September 21st, 1993, and it is overseen by a bipartisan board appointed by the President.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Most of you know our agency administers the AmeriCorps program, which currently engages over 75,000 Americans each year in intensive service.\xc2\xa0 Since the program began 16 years ago, more than 570,000 individuals have given more than 718,000 million hours of service and earned $1.6 billion in education awards to pay for college.\xc2\xa0 AmeriCorps members tutor and mentor youth, build affordable housing, fight poverty, restore parks and rivers, help communities respond to disasters.\xc2\xa0 They also help thousands of nonprofit organizations increase their reach and impact.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Most importantly, the corporation engages people of all ages.\xc2\xa0 We also administer Senior Corps, which has over half a million older Americans in service each year, and Learn and Serve America, which supports service learning by more than a million students annually.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\xc2\xa0can cite numerous examples of how we are making a difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives -- let me just mention these two.\xc2\xa0 Habitat for Humanity has about 500 AmeriCorps members across the country.\xc2\xa0 Last year they recruited and supervised 200,000 volunteers to build 1,700 homes for low-income families.\xc2\xa0 And in Madison, Wisconsin, AmeriCorps VISTAs have recruited 600 volunteers who tutor 3,000 elementary students in reading, which results in higher reading levels and graduation rates.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Beyond service opportunities, the corporation is also known for developing effective approaches for using volunteers; also for training service organizations in best practices and overseeing the annual Martin Luther King Day of Service which, as Melody said, saw record numbers of people participate this year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The corporation is a catalyst for service.\xc2\xa0 We provide support to organizations and we provide opportunity for people to serve and make a difference in their communities.\xc2\xa0 The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act comes at a pivotal moment for this nation because of the economic crisis in particular, which is causing a hardship for millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 We enjoy strong bipartisan support for dramatic expansion in service and the kind of leadership in Congress from Senators Kennedy and Hatch and Representatives Miller and McKeon that was able to bring a bill from introduction to final passage in less than a month.</div> <div class="legacy-para">This also comes at a time when a new generation, known as the millennial generation, is coming of age and looking to participate in something larger than themselves by serving communities and their country.\xc2\xa0 And we have an earlier generation of baby boomers who are wanting to give back.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We know that people want to serve, as witnessed by the Obama effect of people answering the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to service.\xc2\xa0 For example, in March we received more than 17,000 online AmeriCorps applications, which is triple the number over March of last year. That is not an aberration; online AmeriCorps applications in the last five months are up 234 percent compared to the same period a year ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">This is a moment when service and civic participation have become a call to action and a necessity for a healthy democracy and a healthy nation.\xc2\xa0 We think that today\xe2\x80\x99s signing is representative of that moment and bodes for very good things, positive things for this nation.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And now let me turn things over to vice chair of the board, Stephen Goldsmith.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Alan.\xc2\xa0 Let me just make a couple quick comments.\xc2\xa0 First, to emphasize the comments that both you and Melody made, we pride ourselves on being a bipartisan board, a bipartisan organization, and are particularly proud of the bipartisan support in Congress for this bill.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Alan and -- I was the chair the last eight years, and Alan and I have been working on -- with some frustration on reauthorization for the last eight years.\xc2\xa0 So this today is a really dramatic day for the service movement for many reasons.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I was a mayor in Indianapolis, and to me, what -- when the President signs this bill today, it\xe2\x80\x99s a strong commitment of support for the civic infrastructure that makes our cities and counties in America generally strong places.\xc2\xa0 Over the last eight years we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to move to thinking of the AmeriCorps program and the VISTA program and the Learn and Serve program as essentially providing the infrastructure for volunteers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So today the 75,000 AmeriCorps members that we have out there manage, train, or are responsible for 2 million community volunteers.\xc2\xa0 So this, really, shot in the arm for civic America will allow a dramatic expansion, not just in terms of those who are funded in this bill, but those who will have a chance for meaningful volunteer experiences as a result of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So when the bill is signed today and reauthorizes the Corporation for National and Community Service, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be on a path to go from 75,000 AmeriCorps members to 250,000 AmeriCorps members by the year 2017 with the leveraging of tens of millions of Americans into service, which will -- we already see an increase in the interest of Americans in serving, and this will provide the infrastructure for that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The bill strengthens the program called Learn and Serve, which we also manage.\xc2\xa0 Learn and Serve provides opportunities for grade and high school students to serve.\xc2\xa0 But I think probably equally importantly, it emphasizes that service is part of the American ethic, and Learn and Serve, by teaching the importance of service and allowing these young adults to practice service, provides a strong foundation for what will be a lifetime of civic participation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The bill provides the opportunity for a social innovation fund.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with social innovators in my work at Harvard for a number of years.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous amount of talent in the country, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in the social innovation fund will allow the corporation to participate in funding some of the best and most exciting -- those ideas across the country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">As Alan noted, this is a really difficult and important time for nonprofits.\xc2\xa0 Because of the country\xe2\x80\x99s economy, the needs of urban Americans and poor Americans and struggling Americans is greater than ever, and the ability of organizations that serve them to raise money is very challenging.\xc2\xa0 So the bill could not come at a better time and allows us to provide important services to strengthen the capacity of nonprofits and allow them to manage up more volunteers.\xc2\xa0 Today we have 62 million American serving across the United States, and we hope that this bill will allow us to take that number even higher.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\xe2\x80\x99re aggressively in the process of trying to strengthen our management systems to prepare for implementation.\xc2\xa0 And we have $200 million in Recovery Act funds that already authorize 13,000 to AmeriCorps members, and we hope to swear in the first 200 of those within the next week or so.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The bill will allow us to be more effective and streamline the way we treat our grantees, and I guess the way to summarize this is we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited about the opportunity that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to serve so many more Americans.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll take questions now, right, Melody?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I think you know who I am, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 My question is, could someone just give a brief factual outline of the legislation, exactly how much funding has changed?\xc2\xa0 Is this just the authorized level that\xe2\x80\x99s changed or I assume this is -- this money has to still go through appropriations -- just explain exactly what the dollar amount have -- what they were and what they will be, and also what policy changes, if any, are in this legislation?\xc2\xa0 And finally, somebody made a reference to the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on trying to get this reauthorized for a while.\xc2\xa0 When did this expire -- so how long has the reauthorization sort of delay lasted?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Melody, do you want to take that one?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I can answer some of those questions and others can jump in as well to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered all the information.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">As I said, we -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, we have promised to -- or made a pledge or commitment to increase over -- and add an additional 25 percent over the last authorized amount, so adding that additional $1.1 million -- or billion -- to the authorization line.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Laura, that amount of money does have to go through the appropriations process.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working very, very hard to accomplish, but we\xe2\x80\x99re quite hopeful, given the bipartisan support that exists for the legislation and that we were able to see when we passed the legislation this year.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think it was Stephen who mentioned the fact that the legislation expands the number of volunteers -- or the number of people in the Corps from 75,000 to 250,000.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s very, very -- we think is very important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be ramping up toward over the course of the next several years.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we expect to see from now to the point of about 2017.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So it will give us a chance to make sure that the corporation is prepared for that significant expansion.\xc2\xa0 And it also builds on something that the President talked about during the course of the campaign -- and you look at what he called for then and how it mirrors a lot of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in this legislation today -- expanding the Corps to focus on education, health care, clean energy, veterans, economic opportunity, the big national priorities and challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing as a country and having the Corps move in that same direction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The other thing it does, as many of you probably know, is that this is an opportunity for -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s high school students or those who are moving into their careers, seniors and others -- to have an opportunity for additional educational opportunities.\xc2\xa0 So the legislation ties the Segal Education Award to the maximum Pell Grant level, which is now at around $5,300.\xc2\xa0 It also offers an education award to rising middle and high school students, so encourages them to go on to get additional -- their additional education credentials.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The other thing that it does is that it streamlines the lines for -- why can\xe2\x80\x99t I think of the word that I want?\xc2\xa0 It streamlines the flow of money for the corporation so that it can operate more efficiently and more effectively.\xc2\xa0 And it also establishes a nationwide call to service campaign and September 11th as the National Day of Service.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think one of the things that Stephen also mentioned was the social innovation fund, which it establishes to encourage the building -- building upon and creating new service programs.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some incredible work by social entrepreneurs and social innovators over the country; it\xe2\x80\x99s an area that Stephen has particular expertise in.\xc2\xa0 And this establishes a $50-million fund in the first year and one that can grow in the out-years to help build capacity for those programs that we know based on evidence are working; to also look for those ideas that are really creative and we believe have great leadership, and give them the opportunity to work -- which is, I think, consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to looking outside of government, looking outside of Washington, to those programs and efforts taking place around the country that are successful and having impact.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll close and give my colleagues an opportunity to add to this by saying, one of the things that we are very focused on here is not just the number of people who participate, not just the number of hours that are committed, but impact and transformation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what</div> <div class="legacy-para">-- the standard that the corporation will be holding itself to, and making sure that what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here and the dollars that are being spent are put to good use and actually having an impact and transforming communities around the country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anyone else wanted to add something to that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 This is Steve.\xc2\xa0 Also, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say to the last part of the question, we were last authorized in 1996.\xc2\xa0 We were kind of patched together in \xe2\x80\x9896 -- I clearly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t around then -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s been kind of awkwardly managed since then because we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of an amalgam of different programs, and so this is the first reauthorization of the program since 1996.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Carlos or anyone else on the call, is there you anything you want to add?\xc2\xa0 If not, we can move on to the next question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. MONJE:\xc2\xa0 If I could just -- this is Carlos Monje, and Melody is my boss.\xc2\xa0 I work at the Domestic Policy Council.\xc2\xa0 The idea behind this legislation is that everyone can serve, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it also invests new resources and new programs for service learning in schools, making sure our young people get on a path to service, and then on the back end, making sure that our seniors and baby boomers, that we\xe2\x80\x99re better using their skills and putting them to good work -- and also people throughout their lives are more episodic volunteers, and building the capacity of the nonprofit sector to accept those volunteers and put them to work.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning, folks.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Goldsmith, Mr. Solomont, I wonder if you could share with us in your personal lives what it is you might do aside from your government service to contribute to the volunteerism pool in the country.\xc2\xa0 Do you each have a volunteer project?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to start, if I may -- this is Alan Solomont -- because I think we all believe that engaging in service, as important as it is to have impact on communities, it\xe2\x80\x99s also transformational in the lives of those who serve.\xc2\xa0 As a young college graduate in the 1970s, I moved to Lowell, Massachusetts and became a community organizer.\xc2\xa0 And although I went on to a business career, that experience has informed everything else that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done since.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so today I engage in a number of not-for-profit activities, as well as this public service, and as Steve has, as a way of, one, giving back to my community and to the country that has been so good to me, but also because I learned many years ago that working with others in my community is a personally enormously rewarding experience and has helped me grow in a whole sort of -- in a whole number of ways.\xc2\xa0 And I think part of what this legislation and this, really, movement intends to do is to give citizens across the country that sense of citizenship, of belonging to a community or belonging to a nation.\xc2\xa0 Winston Churchill said you make a living by what you do, but you make a life by what you give.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Steve?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Alan.\xc2\xa0 First of all, let me just -- thanks for the question, a good question.\xc2\xa0 Alan and I both are volunteers, by the way, as is the rest of our board.\xc2\xa0 This undertaking is probably -- that we do is 10 or 15 hours a week of volunteer work on behalf of the corporation.\xc2\xa0 I also participate in America\xe2\x80\x99s Promise and their work with kids in dropout programs and the like.\xc2\xa0 So service occupies now probably about half of my week, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, in terms of volunteer work for different organizations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Given that out here in the real world, away from the Beltway, a lot of people are not familiar with what AmeriCorps and others in the corporation for service does, and even in a city like Indianapolis -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to have our former mayor on the line today -- what is -- now that this legislation is going to be signed, and given the Obama effect, what is the corporation going to do to reacquaint Hoosiers, for example, and reacquaint the American people with what these organizations do and what the actual volunteer opportunities are, and how particularly communities of color can plug into this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific question.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I invite my colleagues to jump in, as well -- I think, first of all, what I think Steve called the "Obama effect" is having that effect.\xc2\xa0 I mean, people, even starting with the campaign -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about campaign-related activities, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about people that use the social networking tools on the website that performed over 7,000 service events -- nothing to do with the campaign, but service events -- people became engaged as the President talked about the importance of that engagement.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Moving into the administration, both the President and the First Lady have actively participated in and talk about participating in national service because they believe it\xe2\x80\x99s something that you give to your community to make your community more vibrant, and to address the challenges before us.\xc2\xa0 And I think using that bully pulpit will not only give people and spark people to become more involved, but as we direct people -- and this is something that the President will do today when he calls on people to go to whitehouse.gov -- to look for opportunities to serve and to think more about national service, people pay attention to that.\xc2\xa0 And they, I think, will use the tools on the website to look for opportunities for service in their communities and to think more about national service, and also listen to what the President says about the Corporation for National Service and its mission.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think in the months and years to come as we build on this legislation and work with the board and the leadership at the corporation, and use more vibrant -- additionally vibrant tools on the Internet and using other resources, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll engage those people who have already seen this as an exciting way to help commit themselves to their communities and the nation, and see them bring their neighbors and their friends along, as well.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Alan or Steve or Carlos would like to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 Let me just make a -- I know Mr. Brown and he\xe2\x80\x99s an insightful reporter who used to tell me what I should be doing -- (laughter) -- so let me answer his question real quickly.\xc2\xa0 Let me just take 30 seconds.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So here\xe2\x80\x99s how I would think about the answer to your question.\xc2\xa0 Throughout urban America there are struggling communities in which are located wonderful people.\xc2\xa0 And organizations, neighborhood organizations, not-for-profit, community corporations in those communities are stretched, their resources are thin and their capacity is great, but they need help.\xc2\xa0 And so what we will now be able to do is have additional VISTA workers or AmeriCorps workers who would participate in one of those struggling organizations.\xc2\xa0 And that person or persons would allow that organization to incorporate more of the good heart and capacity and work of volunteers in that community.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen this close up in urban Indianapolis, where an organization just has one -- and an AmeriCorps worker is a 40-hour-a-week worker in most situations, who\xe2\x80\x99s there every day, recruiting and training volunteers and helping get assistance to those who are homeless or those who are abused, in a domestic violence situation or the like.\xc2\xa0 So my hope here is if we have 75,000 AmeriCorps members managing 2 million Americans today, and if stressed community organizations, particularly those in African American neighborhoods that are working so hard to kind of stay afloat, can get some help, I think they can organize their communities in a way that will make them much more effective.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add something?\xc2\xa0 This is not something that is being imposed on the nation by Washington.\xc2\xa0 If anything, this is a response in Washington to something that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, applications for AmeriCorps are triple what they were a year ago. Peace Corps applications are up, programs like City Year and Teach for America are being overwhelmed by the number of people that are applying and have barely -- well, don\xe2\x80\x99t have the capacity to accommodate them.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so I think what\xe2\x80\x99s happening is we\xe2\x80\x99re responding to something that is percolating up from -- it\xe2\x80\x99s generational; there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that young people are the leading edge of this, but we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it among Americans of all ages.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing through this legislation is trying to expand the capacity of our programs and the capacity of the corporation to respond to the enthusiasm for service that\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, sweeping the country.\xc2\xa0 There was an article on the Sunday New York Times about how MTV is altering their programming to reach millennials and to talk about doing good and about volunteer experiences.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I was in New York City yesterday with Mayor Bloomberg, who had filled an indoor arena with about 2,000 young people from the city and announced major initiatives to engage New Yorkers in service.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think that there is something happening out there.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re trying -- we\xe2\x80\x99re, frankly, trying to keep up with that so that Americans who have that urge to volunteer and to give back and to serve their communities have those opportunities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know the bill has money -- will have money to be appropriated for managing volunteers and expanding capacity in certain circumstances.\xc2\xa0 I guess the concern that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from the nonprofits across the nation is that they\xe2\x80\x99re facing huge deficits in terms of their operating budgets.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the administration is considering anything to more generally help the nonprofit groups in America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that we certainly -- that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly sensitive to.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that we started doing through the Recovery Act, and I mentioned some of the stimulus money that was included in the Recovery Act that could go to not-for-profit organizations that we recognize are in economically distressed communities and often are the front line for people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also something that the President spoke to us about in making sure that as we\xe2\x80\x99re providing guidance through -- on the Recovery Act, that we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure that resources are also getting to those organizations that are directly serving people who are in greatest need, as those organizations are struggling themselves as they\xe2\x80\x99re -- many of them are having to down-size and reduce programs.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of and thinking about as we recognize the benefit that these organizations are offering to their communities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you can address yourself to the idea of providing remuneration to people who are nominally volunteers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 Well -- this is Alan Solomont again.\xc2\xa0 I think the word "volunteer" is probably a misnomer for the people that we provide remuneration to since they\xe2\x80\x99re working full-time in communities, anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week.\xc2\xa0 So I think the notion of disparaging, if you will, paid volunteers, or questioning the use of public funds to pay for volunteers is probably not quite on point, since the people that we\xe2\x80\x99re helping to support, and we\xe2\x80\x99re supporting them at rather modest levels, are working full-time or a significant part of their week -- working on problems in communities, working with youngsters, with school dropouts, on illiteracy programs, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a consensus, political consensus and I think a national consensus, that this is a good use of public funds.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think it\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated in the support that the legislation got.\xc2\xa0 It passed the Senate 79-19, passed in the House I think it was 250-149.\xc2\xa0 We see all sectors of society supporting this:\xc2\xa0 business, government, not-for-profit organizations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a lot of support from the media, actually, who I think have done a very good job at helping to reach folks about what other citizens are doing to serve.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So we think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good use of funds and we welcome the increase, and think that the notion that we\xe2\x80\x99re paying volunteers is probably not an accurate characterization.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would just like to add to that that I think that sometimes people use "volunteer" and "national service worker" interchangeably and that everyone is doing good work but there\xe2\x80\x99s a spectrum of service for those who are volunteering and people who often may go into various institutions and utilize their talents for free, and then also people who are engaged in some of the national service programs that Alan and Stephen have described, who may be teaching full-time, who may be building homes and doing other things through AmeriCorps and some of the other corps, all the way to people who, as the President has said, serve in the military.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a very full spectrum of service, and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably but not always quite accurately.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 What is the latest number of people who have signed up for the various service programs in the corporation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 We currently have 75,000 AmeriCorps members.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say that again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 Well, the question is a little difficult to answer because we run a number of different programs and -- from hundreds of thousands of foster grandparents and seniors, to 75,000 AmeriCorps members, to an enormously larger number of Learn and Serve students.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the exact numbers, but I think your two questions are combined because our -- the responsibility of the Corporation for National and Community Service is to generate service opportunities throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 And we do that by the Learn and Serve programs in high school, and we do it by the AmeriCorps and VISTA members, and we do it by the Senior Corps members.\xc2\xa0 We have numbers in each of those.\xc2\xa0 And then each of those programs in turn supports volunteers who are at the local site participating.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s different ways to count each one of those programs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 I can give you some specific numbers.\xc2\xa0 Right now we have 75,000 AmeriCorps members.\xc2\xa0 We have about 492,000 Senior Corps participants, and through Learn and Serve America we reach about 1.1 million students in K through 12 and college.\xc2\xa0 And we leverage through particularly AmeriCorps, about 2.2 million volunteers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t members of any of the streams of service, if you will, but who are members engaging in service.\xc2\xa0 So total, we reach about -- we engage about 4 million Americans in service right now before the expansion that\xe2\x80\x99s about to take place.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 I had a couple questions, but quickly to follow up on Mark\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s a total -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s a total of about 4 million Americans now, could you tell us how many you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at by 2017, assuming that everything is filled?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 Well, if we triple the size of AmeriCorps from 75,000 members to 250,000 members annually, and if we -- if those 75,000 AmeriCorps members are currently engaging 2.2. million volunteers a year, we could triple that to 6.6 million volunteers, 250,000 AmeriCorps members.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- you can do the math -- I think that was about 6 or 7 million, and then we have another half a million in Senior Corps and another million or so in Learn and Serve America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So like 9 million is what you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping for -- so to roughly double?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re as fixated on number per se as we are in giving opportunities to every American who wants to serve at whatever level they are able to.\xc2\xa0 And we hope sooner or later this will be a part of every citizen\xe2\x80\x99s experience.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if I can do my questions real quick, can unemployed people participate in AmeriCorps or in any other components that have pay or educational components attached and still collect their benefits?\xc2\xa0 And also I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for if you can give us sort of a historical sweep -- compare this with the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps in terms of its significance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Do you want to break those two apart?\xc2\xa0 Stephen and Alan, do you want to take the historical significance part?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 Sure, then somebody else can handle the -- answer the benefit issue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Well, this is -- really dwarfs any previous commitment to service from the numbers of individuals who will be involved in AmeriCorps as a result of the expansion to -- the levels of 250,000 will be the greatest numbers of Americans involved in service of any of the programs ever passed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d say, to the extent to which the Peace Corps was an expression of President Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s call to Americans to serve and reverberated far beyond the number of people who actually joined the Peace Corps, this legislation I think represents President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call to Americans to serve and will be equally felt throughout the country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think this has been a movement that\xe2\x80\x99s been growing now and has been growing through a number of different administrations, so it\xe2\x80\x99s also, as a -- like a snowball falling down a hill, has been picking up steam and picking up support throughout.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is not unlike the moment in 1960 when President Kennedy asked Americans to serve, but it is certainly going to engage millions more today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And in terms of the benefits, do we have an answer on that? Employment -- unemployment benefits vary from state to state and eligibility requirements vary from state to state.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can give you an answer nationally.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the job market is one of the reasons why we think young people are looking to community service as a viable alternative coming out of high school and coming out of college for job opportunities, which we think is a very good thing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GOLDSMITH:\xc2\xa0 Just to make sure we got the number counting right -- I\xe2\x80\x99m a little concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 Just 30 seconds here.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s two different things that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, I believe.\xc2\xa0 One is the general response of Americans to the call to service, which Alan mentioned you can go back to President Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s call and come forward.\xc2\xa0 We see from work we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with the census that after 9/11, Americans, particularly young Americans, responded in record numbers.\xc2\xa0 We see that that service interest has been even more sparked and ignited, if you will, by President Obama.\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s all those pieces that we try to continue to stimulate so that service occurs by individuals showing up.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And then you have the folks who serve as a direct result of the programs we run, and those two things get entangled.\xc2\xa0 So when we start counting 8 or 9 million and mix it with the other, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, but it\xe2\x80\x99s best to think about the AmeriCorps expansion as the infrastructure that will help more Americans serve, and that that greater number is the result of the goodheartedness of Americans, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call for service, the nature of the current crises and the like.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you all giving us an opportunity to respond back to you all.\xc2\xa0 My question is, when you talk about the nonprofit organization, to what degree -- are those just nonprofit organizations in churches, or like through United Way affiliates or 501C organizations only?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SOLOMONT:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the whole gamut of nonprofit organizations, from national organizations like the American Red Cross to small community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations that may be affiliated with the church or a synagogue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the -- and when we talk about supporting the infrastructure of nonprofits, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re particularly focused on helping those nonprofits that are feeling vulnerable in these times, and those tend to be smaller, community-based organizations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS.
