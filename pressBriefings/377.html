One<br/>\n\tEn Route Beijing, China</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Director Clapper just arrived back at McChord Joint Base in Washington state with Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller.\xc2\xa0 He went with the sole purpose of bringing home the two remaining Americans who were in custody in North Korea.\xc2\xa0 That was the only purpose of his trip.\xc2\xa0 It was not to pursue any other diplomatic opening.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, we recently were able to recover the other American who had been held in North Korea and we became aware of the opportunity to recover the final two Americans in custody with Director Clapper\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>So the President approved that mission last week and we prepared for several days.\xc2\xa0 And then Director Clapper flew out and was on the ground long enough to retrieve the two Americans and fly them home.\xc2\xa0 But happy to take any Questions you guys have.</p>\n<p>Q. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Did the Director meet with Kim Jong Un or other North Korean leaders while he was there?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 He did not meet with Kim Jong Un but he met with a number of North Korean security officials.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more complete picture when we\xe2\x80\x99re able to have further debriefs with Director Clapper but he did not meet with Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p>Q. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Is it your interpretation that there\xe2\x80\x99s a linkage to the timing of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t say for certain what drove the timing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been making clear to the North Koreans, publicly and privately, that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to resolve the cases of the remaining Americans.\xc2\xa0 And so this is something that came together over the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 And so we can\xe2\x80\x99t gauge exactly why they chose to do this now but it\xe2\x80\x99s a positive step clearly that they released these Americans, allowed them to return home to their families.</p>\n<p>The President is very thankful that the families have been reunited now.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, our concerns with North Korea remain exactly the same with respect to the need for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula so while this addresses an important irritant in our relationship, it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address the underlying concerns we have about their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you know how long he was on the ground for?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to get you the exact time but it was roughly \xe2\x80\x93- it was in the neighborhood of a day but we can get you the exact time.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Did the North Koreans specify, like, we want Clapper as opposed to one of our Cabinet officials to come?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 They wanted a senior American official to come and Director Clapper we felt was the right person, given his background on the Korean Peninsula, where he has focused on throughout his career.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a security official \xe2\x80\x93- we felt that that was appropriate, given that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be a diplomatic effort.\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be an opportunity to pursue discussions on nuclear issues but rather a very specific mission related to bringing home these Americans.\xc2\xa0 So sending a senior intelligence official we felt was the right fit.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You say you went over with the sole purpose of bringing back these two Americans, but do you know if other topics came up -\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We certainly expect -- that the North Koreans to bring up other topics so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly likely that other topics came up.\xc2\xa0 Again, Director Clapper\xe2\x80\x99s posture was simply to reiterate our strong position that North Korea needs to meet its commitments, denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll learn more as we -\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Did you press that upon them?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll learn more as we debrief with him but his posture was certainly simply to underscore the importance of North Korea living up to its commitments to denuclearize the Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also add that we, in advance of Director Clapper\xe2\x80\x99s trip, briefed Japan and South Korea about the purpose of the trip.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x93 also, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with China and a range of other partners.\xc2\xa0 We briefed relevant members of Congress before the trip as well.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to make clear to our partners and to members of Congress what the purpose of his trip was.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what this is, is a very uniQ.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ue opportunity to bring home two Americans, including one \xe2\x80\x93- Kenneth Bae -\xe2\x80\x93 who has been in North Korea for a number of years.\xc2\xa0 And this is certainly a good and happy day for those families and for President Obama and everybody who has worked for the release of these Americans.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is there a definitive signal that allowed this to go?\xc2\xa0 Or was there a series of things that \xe2\x80\x93- what triggered you guys knowing that this was something that could actually happen?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think it was having some degree of assurance that the trip would succeed in bringing home the Americans.\xc2\xa0 And so we got very positive signals from North Korea that such a visit would result in these two Americans being released.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is if we have an opportunity to bring two Americans home, reunite with them their families, remove the final Americans who are in detention in North Korea, that that\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity we should take.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is there anything more on this note from the President signifying he was kind of the emissary?\xc2\xa0 Was that a handwritten note?\xc2\xa0 Did it have any kind of message to -\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It was a brief letter that simply stated that Director Clapper was traveling as the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal envoy with the expressed purpose of bringing these two Americans home.\xc2\xa0 It did not go into detail about other subjects.\xc2\xa0 It was simply \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was to Kim Jong Un?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 It was simply to identify Director Clapper as the President\xe2\x80\x99s envoy and express the purpose of his visit being to bring our two Americans home.\xc2\xa0 It was short and to the particular point and, again, did not enter into detailed discussion about other matters of policy.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Was there any other discussion prior to Clapper going about other officials?\xc2\xa0 Because I remember in the past the U.S. has offered up people and there have been refrains of something like that\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, there had been some consideration of other officials or people outside of government.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, what became apparent was this would be -\xe2\x80\x93 well, for instance, you remember in the past people like Bill Clinton have gone, but it became apparent that we would have the best chance of success at bringing the two Americans home if we sent a government official, a U.S. government official rather than going through a Track Two or external figures.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that led us to look at \xe2\x80\x93- go from within the U.S. government, and Director Clapper we felt was the best fit as a senior official, as someone who could clearly represent the President but someone who came from a security background and not someone who would be in the more diplomatic realm because we did not want to indicate that this was a broader discussion.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to keep it focused on the issue of the detained Americans.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The U.S. proposed his name as, how about Clapper \xe2\x80\x93- I mean, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t specifically say, like, this is the official -\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it was a U.S. decision to send Director Clapper.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You said the President was informed and approved of the plan and then it took several days to \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, several days to plan the logistics.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been aware of and working towards for a number of weeks.\xc2\xa0 But it was kind of last week that I think it really came together.\xc2\xa0 The President moved it forward and then there were several days of logistical preparations.</p>\n<p>Q.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Anything that you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned about their condition or how they were treated that you could share with us?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very preliminary.\xc2\xa0 They appear to be in relatively good condition, given what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been through.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve just returned home, they\xe2\x80\x99ve just been reunited with their families, and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have extensive information about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said about their condition and treatment.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\tEND</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
