EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good day, friends.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Colorado.\xc2\xa0 Jen Psaki and I will be briefing again -- together again today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI have one quick announcement to make, which is, at the top of the flight, the beginning of the flight, the President had a phone call -- phone conversation with the Prime Minister of India.\xc2\xa0 The President expressed his condolences to the Prime Minister because, as you know, several of the victims in the shooting in Wisconsin were Indian nationals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two leaders spoke about their shared commitment to tolerance and religious freedom.\xc2\xa0 And the President again reiterated his appreciation for the significant contributions that Sikhs make to the broader American community, and again reiterated his condolences.</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe Jen has a topper as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, is kicking off this morning a two-day trip to Colorado.\xc2\xa0 The first event will be focused on -- he will focus his remarks on his commitment to ensuring women have access to affordable health care, can make choices about their health care decisions.\xc2\xa0 And it will just serve as a reminder to women in Colorado and women across the country of the stakes in this election that we are facing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe women -- the audience will also have a heavier concentration of women.\xc2\xa0 Men, of course, are allowed into the event.\xc2\xa0 But we did include, in addition to inviting people of the community -- it\xe2\x80\x99s free and open to the public -- we did invite several local women\xe2\x80\x99s groups and organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, Sandra Fluke will be introducing the President at the event this morning.\xc2\xa0 She had an op-ed this morning in a local paper, I encourage you to read.\xc2\xa0 And finally, Elizabeth Banks -- excellent actress -- put out -- is featured in a video the campaign put out overnight, also talking about the same issues and the stakes for women in this election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I wanted to follow up on a question from the briefing yesterday.\xc2\xa0 You said you\xe2\x80\x99d get back to us on your assessment of the Priorities ad and whether it was appropriate to essentially tie Mitt Romney to the man in the video\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xc2\xa0 And Jen, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your assessment of that ad as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply say that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the ad but I have read about it.\xc2\xa0 And I speak for the President.\xc2\xa0 I do not speak for a third-party organization.\xc2\xa0 This was in the context yesterday of a discussion about the categorically false and blatantly dishonest advertisement from the Romney campaign\xc2\xa0 -- not a third-party group -- from the Romney campaign with regards to the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy on welfare reform.\xc2\xa0 And I would just state that, again, the ad is categorically false and blatantly dishonest.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been no waivers even granted.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Health and Human Services has simply said it is willing to listen to requests for waivers.\xc2\xa0 And this issue arose because of the interest expressed by Republican governors in getting waivers.\xc2\xa0 And the HHS guidelines have made clear that no waivers would be granted unless the states could demonstrate that they will increase by 20 percent the number of individuals who are moved from welfare to work.\xc2\xa0 So this is a --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a separate issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, this is not a separate issue.\xc2\xa0 This is about Romney campaign\xe2\x80\x99s advertising about the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is important to say that there is a point at which you need to set aside covering tactics and simply evaluate things based on fact or fiction.\xc2\xa0 You guys know, as a matter of policy, that this is entirely fictitious.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Jen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a one-for-one thing.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t, well -- my question is about the White House and the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for a third-party group that supports Obama to put out an ad that essentially ties Mitt Romney to a worker\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s death.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I still haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the ad.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for a third-party group.\xc2\xa0 I speak for the President and the administration, and I explain and defend his policies.\xc2\xa0 And again, I will simply point you to an ad that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told by your colleagues, has a lot of money behind it, that\xe2\x80\x99s running all over the country, that entirely falsely describes the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy on a specific issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think that certainly merits coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I will echo some of what Jay said here, which is that we have nothing -- no involvement with any ads that are done by Priorities USA.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any knowledge of the story of the family.\xc2\xa0 As you know, campaign finance rules in that regard are in place for a reason.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, while we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this ad, which we all know we had no involvement in, Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s team is running a dishonest ad, an ad that is a big, bold-faced lie that even President Clinton has said was disappointing and inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an ad that they should be held accountable for and on the facts, because right now they\xe2\x80\x99re out there running it across the country as if this is a true policy when in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation we feel like we should be having.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that Romney\xe2\x80\x99s folks are trying to almost kind of neutralize the advantage you think you might get from using Bill Clinton by using him to -- in an ad to criticize the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time that they have attempted to use President Clinton.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting because President Clinton is not only a strong supporter of President Obama -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking about him at the convention -- but he has said time and time again that President Obama is the right person to lead the country forward, to help our economy continue to move forward.\xc2\xa0 So if that\xe2\x80\x99s the best validator they can find -- someone who thinks President Obama is a far better choice on the economy and on other issues -- perhaps his bench is a little shorter than we thought it was.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add as a matter of policy, as somebody who covered in detail the passage of welfare reform under President Clinton, there is no more credible spokesman on this issue than former President Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I would note not only his assessment that this ad by the Romney campaign, as a matter of policy, is categorically false and blatantly dishonest, but I would also note that two of the architects of welfare reform within the Clinton administration -- Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling -- work for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 I would also note a report today that quotes the senior Republican staffer who helped draft that legislation in Congress at the time, who also assesses this ad as false and misleading.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, at some point, while there is a place for covering the back and forth, and he said this and he said that, there is also a need to assess things based on their truthfulness.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- there is a great void here when it comes to truthfulness.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is some new polling today that suggests that President Obama is actually running behind in Colorado.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, how seriously do you take that polling?\xc2\xa0 How much are you concerned about shoring up both the women\xe2\x80\x99s vote and Latino turnout in Colorado?\xc2\xa0 And why do you think that there is -- if the polling is right, why do you think that this trend is emerging in Colorado?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 One is, we know three things -- that we need 270 electoral votes; that there are going to be a lot of polls between now and Election Day; and that the race is going to be very close, especially in these key states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also, if you look at the sampling of the poll, we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty confident that the final electorate is not going to -- is unlikely to reflect the sample, which has --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, which is the poll you just asked about, correct -- which has an under-sampling of Latino voters; in our view, an oversampling of voters over 65; and more men than women.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a contributing factor as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to Colorado today because we know the race is going to be close, because we know that women and families in Colorado care deeply about having access to affordable health care.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is going there to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving any stone unturned.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not taking any vote for granted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ll note from our schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to some parts of the state where President Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t win four years ago.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make up a 20-point deficit, but we know that for every voter in Colorado Springs, every voter in Pueblo, every voter in Grand Junction and the Denver area that comes our way, that supports us like they did in 2008, or people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t even vote that last time, that that\xe2\x80\x99s another vote in Colorado toward getting us over the finish line there and towards getting us toward the 270.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the -- we\xe2\x80\x99re all looking forward to hearing about who Mitt Romney is going to tap as his running mate.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about how the campaign and the President are following that -- whether the President has his own bets or inside picks for who he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see as the ticket to be running against?\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on that at all?\xc2\xa0 How is he monitoring it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can just say, in conversations I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a part of, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard him express an opinion about who that might be.\xc2\xa0 But Jen might have a perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We all think Newt Gingrich or Michelle Bachmann would be an excellent choice for Mitt Romney to choose.\xc2\xa0 No, obviously, the campaign is -- we are closely watching.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know any more than you do about the day and who it will be.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as he picks, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to tell you why that person may be a bad choice for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Since Jen mentioned Newt Gingrich, and I know that, again, as a matter of the factual accuracy of the critique of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, the Romney campaign put Newt Gingrich forward, I suppose believing that he\xe2\x80\x99s a very credible spokesman on this issue -- I think he took a shot at the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply note that Kathleen Sebelius twice won statewide election in Kansas -- not exactly a liberal state.\xc2\xa0 And I looked it up, and Newt Gingrich got 14 percent in Kansas -- 14.4.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll also add that any way you cut it, whomever we pick, we\xe2\x80\x99d much rather have Vice President Biden on our side campaigning across the country, in the debates, out there standing up for the President than any of the motley crew that Mitt Romney is choosing between.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A slightly different topic, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I know you were asked about Standard Chartered yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates on that?\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any discussions with his officials or British officials about this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any conversations the President has had with foreign leaders on this matter or, for that matter, internally.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would simply echo what I said yesterday, which is that this is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation so I have no comment specifically on it.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the track record at Treasury on issues like this.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a further comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment at all about reports that people within the Treasury were upset with regulators for doing what they did?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I saw those reports, but I have nothing to add.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a separate foreign policy issue, is the United States working right now on coming up with names to replace Kofi Annan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that we\xe2\x80\x99re simply working with our partners, both at the United Nations and more broadly, including the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d on a concerted effort to pressure the Assad regime, support the Syrian people, provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, provide non-lethal assistance to the opposition, assist the opposition in its efforts to unify and constitute itself, and assist broadly in the effort to prepare for the day when -- the welcome day when Assad is no longer in power in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is it to have a replacement as a special envoy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any discussions about that.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have been frustrated, as you know, by the failure of the United Nations Security Council to pass meaningful resolutions against Assad that would hold Assad accountable for his failure to live up to his promises.\xc2\xa0 So we are working on all levels to bring about -- to help bring about the future that Syria and the Syrian people so desperately deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support the Egyptian operation overnight in the Sinai, following the border attack the other day?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me consult my book here.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on Egypt, except to say what I said the other day, and that is that we regret the loss of Egyptian life in the attack in the Sinai.\xc2\xa0 And as President Morsi stated the other night, his government strongly rejects this type of extremist violence and has pledged to hold accountable those responsible for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Violent extremism and border security are shared challenges, and we encourage Egypt and Israel to work together against these common threats.\xc2\xa0 And actually, I do realize I can tell you that we are in close contact with our friends in Egypt and Israel about the security situation in the Sinai.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the substance of those consultations, but I would note that the Egyptians have underscored their commitment to address the security situation in the Sinai and made constructive comments about relations with their neighbors.\xc2\xa0 And they have shown a willingness to take action when necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, just to follow up, a question on Colorado.\xc2\xa0 How did you choose the places where the President is going today and tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Do you have any -- about any specific location,\xc2\xa0 or did you mean the locations like the school or the town?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean the towns.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, every time we go to a state, we consult with the state to determine what the most important places are to go, to reach not only our supporters but voters we can influence and pull over to our side.\xc2\xa0 We have a two-pronged strategy, which is to excite and engage our supporters, but also to persuade people who either are soft supporters of Mitt Romney or are undecided at this stage.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if you look at some of the places we\'re going, we know that even though, say, Grand Junction and Pueblo are places that may lean a little bit in the other direction, they\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Colorado Springs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 -- and Colorado Springs -- they are places where we do still have a strong base of supporters, where we have an excellent ground game where we think the President\'s message, the President\'s commitment to fighting for the middle class is very effective.\xc2\xa0 As you probably know as a native, the issue of clean energy and specifically the recent wind tax credit debate is also a huge issue in Colorado.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the places we\'re going tomorrow -- Pueblo -- that town is one of the towns that will be impacted if the wind tax credit is not continued, because Vestas, the company that has been mentioned in a number of recent news stories, their CEO has said they would have to lay off 1,700 workers -- a lot of them would be in Pueblo, a small town.\xc2\xa0 So this is another topic, in addition to talking about women today, that the President will be talking about over the course of the next two days.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, really, Colorado is a key state for us and our goal of winning 270 electoral votes.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a -- we have a great ground game here.\xc2\xa0 We know that we need to leave no stone unturned and compete for every single vote.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what we\'re doing over the next two days.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:23 P.M.
