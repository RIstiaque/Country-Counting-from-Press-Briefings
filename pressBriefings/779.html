Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:17 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I think as you know, the President and Speaker of the House had a meeting here at the White House a little earlier today.\xc2\xa0 Conversations continue.\xc2\xa0 I have no readout of that meeting to provide, though I\'m sure you will ask for one.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we have a readout of the meeting?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about gun violence and then fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 The President made an impassioned plea last night for the nation to do more to protect its children, and I want to try to get a little more specific about what he means.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us when he talks about using the power of his office whether that includes using the power of his office to push for tighter gun control?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke last night at the vigil in Newtown and he spoke about the fact that the families of Newtown are not alone.\xc2\xa0 And he also spoke about the fact that the kind of violence that occurred in Newtown occurs too often in this country, although what we saw in Newtown was particularly horrific.\xc2\xa0 He said that in the coming weeks he would use the power of his office to engage the American people and lawmakers, law enforcement, mental health experts, educators and others in an effort to try to prevent these kinds of terrible tragedies from happening in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s a complex problem that will require a complex solution. No single piece of legislation, no single action will fully address the problem.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have a specific agenda to announce to you today.\xc2\xa0 I would simply point you to what the President said last night about moving forward in coming weeks and I would look for him to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the comprehensive solution, do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair and accurate to say that addressing gun violence, gun control, would have to be part of it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s part of it, but it is far from all of it.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President has taken positions on common-sense measures that he believes should be taken to help address this problem, but he made clear that more needs to be done, that we as a nation have not done enough clearly to fulfill our number-one obligation, which is to protect our children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on this.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\'ve seen these horrific moments come and go and the debate about gun safety, children\xe2\x80\x99s safety goes with it.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that he needs to capitalize on this, get this conversation going and see some action in the short term, or does he feel like he can get through fiscal cliff, immigration, and there\xe2\x80\x99s now a mind-set and a will to get this done months down the line?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific timeline for you for what the President will do moving forward.\xc2\xa0 I would simply refer you to his remarks last night when he talked about the action he hoped to take to engage the American people in the coming weeks. I think that what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School has clearly shocked the entire nation and has laid bare the necessity of evaluating the various things that we can and must do as a nation to try to better protect our children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple quickly on fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 The President said to the Business Roundtable recently that Republicans need to reach what you called a conceptual breakthrough on rates, tax rates going up, and then once that happens, a deal could come together pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel he has that now that Speaker Boehner is talking about rates as part of the conversation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t comment on specific reported proposals or counterproposals on internal conversations between the President and the Speaker, or the President\xe2\x80\x99s team and the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s team, or with other members of leadership.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that rates need to go up on the top 2 percent was based on an economic reality, which is that in order to achieve a broad deficit reduction package that puts our economy on a sustainable fiscal path in the future, a certain level of revenue gleaned from the wealthy has to be met.\xc2\xa0 And the only way to do that was through, in part, rates rising.\xc2\xa0 That remains his position.</p>\n<p>So we have seen since the election a change in tone and, in some cases, a change in position from different Republicans, including elected Republicans, on the issue of, first revenue, and then acknowledging that rates have to go up.\xc2\xa0 But thus far, the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that\xe2\x80\x99s so necessary.\xc2\xa0 And the balance is important because a plan that does not have it puts unduly the burden on senior citizens, or on middle-class Americans, or on parents with disabled children, and that is not acceptable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Balance is essential because in order to move forward in a way that protects the middle class, we need to have the package include the kind of revenue that the President has talked about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 The President campaigned on taxes going up on households over $250,000.\xc2\xa0 He was very clear and specific about that.\xc2\xa0 When you were asked about that threshold over the summer, you said the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has been the same for a long, long time; it has not changed and it will not change.\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the Boehner proposal of a million, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking about the President\xe2\x80\x99s stand.\xc2\xa0 Is it still and will remain that $250,000 is the threshold?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times from here in recent weeks and months, which is that the only plan that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that achieves the size and the balance that\xe2\x80\x99s required for sustainable -- for long-term deficit reduction and putting our economy on a sustainable fiscal path is the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And an element -- an important element of that on the revenue side is allowing current law when it comes to the top 2 percent to remain in place, which would see rates on those wealthy Americans rise even as we extend, and in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, make permanent, tax cuts for the 98 percent of the American people -- for the other 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, his position is not based on the notion that these rates have to go up because that\'s good in and of itself.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s based on the necessity of having enough revenue as part of this balanced package, and revenue only coming from the wealthiest Americans, those who can afford it most, to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not unduly putting the burden on the middle class or on seniors or families with children with disabilities.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the underlying premise that the President has always had, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been the foundation of the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to mix it up here, go in back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Japan\xe2\x80\x99s incoming Prime Minister, instead of visiting China first, like his first term, he said he would like to visit the U.S. first, early next year.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of his visit?\xc2\xa0 And also he said he would like to stop the challenge from China over the disputed islands. Will the U.S. support that position?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say that we congratulate Liberal Democratic Party President Shinzo Abe on his election as Japan\xe2\x80\x99s next Prime Minister and on his party\xe2\x80\x99s success in the elections in Japan yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The U.S.-Japan alliance serves as the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific, and we look forward to working closely with the new Japanese Prime Minister, cabinet, and the people of Japan on a range of important bilateral, regional and global issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also like to say that the President appreciates Prime Minister Noda\xe2\x80\x99s contribution -- contributions rather -- to U.S.-Japan relations on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues.\xc2\xa0 And we would like to thank Prime Minister Noda for his service and wish him well in his future endeavors.</p>\n<p>As you know, of course, the new Prime Minister does not take office -- and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that before we start talking about potential meetings or policy discussions with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, you made the point last Friday that that was not the day to start to talk about policy as it relates to gun control.\xc2\xa0 But we are looking for some more specifics, especially now that the President has said quite plainly that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to use all the powers of his office to engage Americans on the issue.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman has suggested a national commission on violence.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be -- would he consider setting up a presidential task force on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I think is important to note is what the President said about the actions he intends to take in coming weeks to engage the American people in efforts to try to prevent these kinds of tragedies from happening again in the future, and to engage broadly -- that means lawmakers and law enforcement officials, and mental health professionals, and educators -- because this is a complex problem that requires many solutions, not just one.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a series of proposals to present to you.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President spoke yesterday about moving forward in the coming weeks --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he consider such a --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rule in or rule out specific proposals.\xc2\xa0 I think, broadly speaking, it\xe2\x80\x99s I think a reflection of the tragedy in Newtown and its horrific nature that both elected officials and others are thinking broadly about ways that we can move forward, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing -- and being thoughtful in their approach, because it\xe2\x80\x99s just generally important as we move forward on this not to get into a situation where anybody retreats to the usual corner or starts issuing the usual talking points.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we -- and the President does -- that we all recognize that we need to change a situation in this country that has led to too many senseless deaths of American children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said on Friday as well that the President remains committed to working to reinstate the ban on assault weapon sales.\xc2\xa0 Senator Feinstein said over the weekend that she will come back from the holidays, next year, with a new Congress, and she will put forth such a proposal.\xc2\xa0 Will the President and the White House support that effort and help push it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in specific point-by-point policy proposals or prescriptions.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as you know, has long supported reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has said, and I just said, this is a complex problem that requires complex and a variety of solutions.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific policy outline for you today from the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that this is about our gun laws and enforcing them, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also about a broader series of issues, including issues of mental health and education and the like.</p>\n<p>So the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on the assault weapons ban has not changed; he still supports its reenactment.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from him I think, as he said last night, in the coming weeks to speak more specifically about what he thinks we can do moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So last question on this -- even in the aftermath of this tragedy --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to give others a chance here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- just what if any concern does the President have that his fellow Democrats, as well as some Republicans, will be hesitant to, in the face of opposition from the gun lobby, to move forward on -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ll feel intimidated, they won\xe2\x80\x99t move forward on actions to bring gun control into force?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we all recognize that this is a complex problem and there are obstacles to taking action of a variety -- coming from a variety of places.\xc2\xa0 And what the President hopes, as you heard him say last night, is that everyone steps back and looks at a situation that has to be addressed, and thinks broadly and thoughtfully about how we can move forward.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly hopes that that will happen.</p>\n<p>Yes, Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the fiscal cliff, is there concern on the part of the White House, given the reaction that some conservative groups have already got to the latest proffer from the Speaker -- a very negative reaction from some quarters -- that you could get in a situation where if you push the Speaker too far, you get an agreement with him but it becomes moot because he can\xe2\x80\x99t marshal the votes to pass it in the House? How are you balancing that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, John Boehner is the Speaker of the House, he is the leader of the House of Representatives, the leader of the House Republican conference, and I believe the third most powerful elected official in the land.\xc2\xa0 So I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him what his politics are or how he should work with his conference.</p>\n<p>But we are obviously engaged in conversations with the Speaker and his staff and other leadership members, and believe that we can -- that the parameters of an agreement have been and are clear.\xc2\xa0 It requires balance, in our view.\xc2\xa0 It requires a deal that does not unduly put the burden on seniors, or middle-class Americans, or families with children of disabilities, or kids trying to go to college.\xc2\xa0 And on the issue of revenues, it is absolutely a fact that rates will go up on the top 2 percent.</p>\n<p>And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not addressing specific proposals and reactions to proposals, but it has always been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that we need to extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That is a position that Republicans and Democrats alike support, and the President has been arguing for months now that the House ought to simply pass that Senate bill that gives the certainty that it would give to the middle class, that their taxes won\xe2\x80\x99t go up on January 1st, and then we can discuss the issue of tax rates for the remaining 2 percent -- the top 2 percent in the United States.</p>\n<p>The purpose, broadly, is for balance.\xc2\xa0 And the President has always said that part of this is revenue and part of this is spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 And he is willing to make tough choices on the issue of spending cuts, and that remains the case.\xc2\xa0 So any potential agreement would not only have to align with the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles; it would require tough choices by both sides, including the President and including Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way it can come together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify, is the goal here to get the best deal you can from the Speaker, or to get the best deal that you can get through the House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the best deal that we can sign into law for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And there are very clear principles that the President has laid out, and one is that we will not -- he will not sign into law an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 He will not.\xc2\xa0 He would veto any legislation that got to his desk that extended those tax cuts for the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 Any deal that attempted to reduce our deficit broadly for the long term, a bigger deal that he has been seeking, has to be balanced.\xc2\xa0 It has to have enough revenue from those who can afford it, and a mix of spending cuts that do not unduly put the burden on seniors or the middle class or students or families who have children with disabilities.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are the fundamental parameters that the President has brought with him in these conversations.</p>\n<p>He believes that a deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 He believes that it would be a good thing for the economy if we were to get a deal that met those parameters and also allowed us to continue to invest in key areas of our economy, because the purpose here, by the way, on the first instance of avoiding the fiscal cliff is to avoid a situation where -- that would affect our potential to continue to grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the second issue is engaging in longer-term deficit reduction in a way that allows the economy to grow faster and create jobs more quickly.</p>\n<p>So these are big goals, lofty goals, but they\xe2\x80\x99re important ones.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, unfortunately we\xe2\x80\x99ve realized that there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a pattern to the public engagement following these shootings.\xc2\xa0 At first, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of shock and there\xe2\x80\x99s outrage, but then over time it sort of gives way to I guess people being -- people having less concern than they did.\xc2\xa0 In light of that, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it more likely that people retreat to their corners, which you say you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see, the farther out from this event?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned yesterday that he would, in coming weeks, use the power of his office to try to engage the American people and lawmakers and law enforcement officials and mental health experts and others in an effort to try to prevent these kinds of tragedies from happening again, and he will do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the first part of your question, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine people in any near term somehow forgetting the rawness of what happened on Friday.\xc2\xa0 It is hard to think about 20 six- and seven-year-olds and what happened to them on Friday and imagine that, in a few weeks or a few months, that pain would not still be incredibly intense and present.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably true for everyone in this room, and I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s true for the vast majority of people in Washington and around the country.\xc2\xa0 So what happened was both consistent, unfortunately, with a series of events that have been happening in the United States, but also exceptional in its horrendousness.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does he feel that engaging right now is counterproductive or inappropriate in light of the fact that obviously he feels that this is different, that somehow this pushes the shelf life of concern?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President spoke about this from the heart with great passion and conviction just last night.\xc2\xa0 So the idea that he\xe2\x80\x99s not engaging in this at present I think doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain the speech that he gave last night.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a series of specific steps --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, what you said about how it\xe2\x80\x99s not the time to sort of push specific policy prescriptions.\xc2\xa0 Is that because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s inappropriate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I said that on Friday, at a time, remember, when there were still bodies in the school.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken twice since then and you heard him speak about what he plans to do in the coming weeks just last night.\xc2\xa0 So I will leave it to him to follow what he said he would do, and, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Jon Christopher, then Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the aftermath of what happened on Friday and the President\xe2\x80\x99s two speeches, does this issue of serious gun control legislation, is that still the third rail of politics for Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in political analysis. There have been challenges to moving forward on a variety of issues that relate to the problem of gun violence in America, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the complexity of the problem and the complexity of the solutions will mean that there will be obstacles moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about how that might play out in the future.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific set of proposals to discuss with you today, at least from the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the course of the last four years as President, he\xe2\x80\x99s been consoling communities now four times -- Aurora, Arizona, Fort Hood, and now in Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that in 2008 he pledged, I think it was at the DNC that year, where he said specifically that he would keep AK-47s out of criminals\xe2\x80\x99 hands and had advocated among other things reinstating the assault weapons ban, what does the President say today to Americans in communities like the one he visited just yesterday why nothing more has happened yet?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s support for reinstatement of the assault weapons ban has been the case ever since it expired, and was true -- has been true for the past several years.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we have taken steps to improve background checks, which goes at the issue of preventing those who should not have guns from acquiring them.\xc2\xa0 But as you heard the President say last night, we all need to do more.\xc2\xa0 We must change.\xc2\xa0 We must take more action and greater action to address this problem, because we have not adequately in his view taken care of our first priority, which in this case was protecting our children.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s committed himself, as you heard him last night say, to using the power of his office to help bring about that change. And he will do that in a way that is inclusive because it requires more than a President; it requires more than gun laws and more than legislation.\xc2\xa0 So he will engage in a process that encompasses a lot of different communities and potential actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it then unfair for Americans to say that the President should have done more in the course of the last four years?\xc2\xa0 They point today to facts like -- that he signed bills allowing guns in National Parks and on Amtrak, and say, why is this conversation starting only now?\xc2\xa0 Should he have done more in the course of the last four years?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard over the course of his presidency the President speak about these tragedies and about taking common-sense measures to deal with gun violence, to prevent those who should not have weapons from acquiring them.\xc2\xa0 And we have taken some actions, but there is no question, as the President said last night, that we need to change and we need to do more.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to doing that.</p>\n<p>George.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If combating gun violence is moving up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative agenda, how do you keep that from distracting from the focus on jobs, the economy, fiscal issues and the way that critics said health care did in the first term?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting way ahead of yourself, George.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have a lot of priorities as a nation, and this President will work on a series of issues that he considers priorities for the nation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we all as a country need to have the bandwidth to move forward on all of them.\xc2\xa0 He certainly will do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, as legislative items go, is this now a priority?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rank priorities.\xc2\xa0 This is clearly extremely important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he did last night -- he said -- he made it sound like this was the most important thing on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rank priorities.\xc2\xa0 We have to take -- the President just met with the Speaker of the House to continue discussions on the fiscal cliff and efforts to get our deficits under control.\xc2\xa0 We have the priority of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We have further steps we need to take to enhance economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And we need to take meaningful action when it comes to the problem and scourge of gun violence in America.\xc2\xa0 We need to do all of it.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to just that.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on another topic, Benghazi, the State Department today said that Secretary Clinton received the report from the Accountability Review Board and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for that.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an idea of when the President -- when you expect the President may receive that, and what kind of action the White House may take to prevent another terror attack like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you in terms of that process, when that report moves from the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The President has looked forward to the Review Board\xe2\x80\x99s work as he looks forward to the completion of the investigation by the FBI.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say what action he will take since we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow-up then -- to cooperate with that investigation, the FBI is still investigating as well.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of when the last time the President got an update from the FBI on where their investigation on Benghazi stands?\xc2\xa0 And also, Secretary Clinton has been ill, obviously, and nobody would expect her to testify right now.\xc2\xa0 But is the administration committed to having her testify before she leaves office, basically?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would ask the State Department about her schedule and her illness that she\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any updates the President has gotten on an investigation.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, last night the President said in his speech, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?\xe2\x80\x9d When he referred to \xe2\x80\x9cour freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d was he referring to gun rights?\xc2\xa0 Was he referring to the difficulty that some societies have, some communities have now when it comes to committing people against their will?\xc2\xa0 What exactly did he mean by \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that he meant, broadly, those and other issues -- that we obviously have a society that is one based on laws, but it is a free society that creates a balance between the laws that we must abide and the freedoms that we enjoy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So both?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get -- I think that both could be encompassed within the meaning of what he said and other issues of freedoms and responsibilities more broadly.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single specific meaning.\xc2\xa0 I think it was broader than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The President has been focused on the health care system in this country since he took office.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that the mental health care system in this country is adequate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good question, and I would say that the Obama administration has taken action for the past four years to ensure that more Americans have access to mental health services, and we will continue to work with leaders across the country to help ensure people get the care and treatment they need.\xc2\xa0 As you know the Affordable Care Act will ensure that 30 million more Americans have access to health care, including mental health services.\xc2\xa0 And the law makes recommended health services available without a copay or deductible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why the President explicitly talked about engaging not just with lawmakers and law enforcement officials and educators but mental health experts is because that\'s clearly a factor that needs to be addressed in some of these cases of horrific violence.\xc2\xa0 So what the Affordable Care Act has done, Obamacare, if you will, has ensured that mental health services are integral and part of the services that the 30 million people who will be -- additional Americans who will have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act will receive, and in terms of the recommended services, receive them without a co-pay or deductible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think that reflects the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view on how important mental health services are.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to this broader -- or rather this more specific issue of mental health and the kind of violence that we saw in Newtown, I think that he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important that experts in that field are part of this discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Jay, after the Tucson shooting that left Congresswoman Gabby Giffords seriously wounded and six others dead, including a little girl, the President wrote an op-ed, this is in 2011, in the Arizona Star, and he talked about the gun restrictions he favored.\xc2\xa0 He said that \xe2\x80\x9cThe laws on the books should be enforced more when it came to the background check.\xc2\xa0 It relies on data supplied by states, but the data is often incomplete and inadequate.\xc2\xa0 We must do better.\xc2\xa0 Second, we should reward the states who provide the best data.\xc2\xa0 And third, we should make the system faster and nimbler.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So that was about -- that was almost two years ago, so what\xe2\x80\x99s the progress on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is -- I mean, I would refer you to the Justice Department for the specifics, but we have taken steps specifically on the issue of background checks to make the system more thorough and complete because this is a key component of an effort to enforce existing laws that when properly enforced do not allow weapons to fall into the hands of those who should not have them under existing law.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s an important component.\xc2\xa0 We have taken steps -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will be part of the broader discussion moving forward, but it is an issue that we have taken steps on because the background check system,\xc2\xa0 making it more complete and thorough, is an important component.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last, Jay, in the October presidential debate, the President said -- one of the debates:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWeapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don\'t belong on our streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you name one thing the President has done in the last four years to help remove weapons of war from our streets?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question, Jake, that the scourge of gun violence is a problem that has not sufficiently been addressed, because, as we saw in Newtown, we continue to have horrific tragedies that result in innocent victims.\xc2\xa0 The President supports the assault weapons ban and the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, but we have to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- tell me about his thinking.\xc2\xa0 I mean like has he taken one measure, one act -- one -- to remove the weapons of war that he talks about?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, he supports legislation that is designed to ban some weapons.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, this is a complex issue and that requires complex solutions.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to engaging the American people in an effort to do more.\xc2\xa0 As he made clear last night, we need to change.\xc2\xa0 We have not done enough -- we as a nation.\xc2\xa0 And he will, in coming weeks, use the power of his office to try to help make that change.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a no?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of the power of his office, the President, of course, sits atop agencies that have a tremendous amount of resources they can pull together for him at his direction options, new policies.\xc2\xa0 Has he, since Friday, asked either HHS, the Justice Department, any one at the DPC to either form a task force or do anything to bring to him either new ideas, research, data, anything to address what you described as a complex problem that requires a complex solution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into internal policy deliberations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that would be different.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about deliberation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if he had asked for things to be brought to him to be assembled.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That would be an internal request or an internal policy deliberation as to make those kinds of requests or to compile those kinds of proposals.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward, as he said last night, to engaging with the American public in the coming weeks in an effort to try to prevent these kinds of tragedies from happening in the future, and engage broadly -- not just with lawmakers, not just with legislation related to guns, but broadly -- on all of the issues that are in play here that affect this scourge of gun violence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michael Bloomberg on Friday and then Joe Califano in the Post today said time is of the essence.\xc2\xa0 Does the President disagree that there is a clamoring from some corners to move more rapidly on this one particular issue -- not the wide, complex range of issues, but on this issue, gun control, specifically -- does the President disagree with that assessment either as a matter of timing or politics or policy, and if so, why?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President say and use the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cin coming weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about months or years; he said coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 But that is not specific to any one particular avenue of pursuit.\xc2\xa0 Again, gun laws are a part of this, but they are not the only part of this, as anyone who is truly an expert on these issues will tell you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he will -- and again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just cite him again from last night -- he will engage in an effort in coming weeks to bring an array of people in the American public and move forward in this effort to try to prevent these tragedies from happening again.\xc2\xa0 These are -- there is no single legislation, no single bill that\xe2\x80\x99s been written, that\xe2\x80\x99s been enacted and expired that alone solves this problem.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have to take a broader approach.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, through conversations on the Hill and in this building, it has been suggested to many of us that some genuine progress has been achieved on the fiscal cliff, that things are not where they were a week ago, either atmospherically or in the exchange of the ideas, the productive nature of the exchanges of ideas.\xc2\xa0 Broadly speaking, would you agree that this process is in a different place than it was a week ago, and that, not predicting anything in the future, that a sufficient number of issues have been at least dealt with and that you might be closer to a deal than we were, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, a week ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without going into details of conversations, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we have continued to engage in communications with the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office and his staff and with the other leaders and their staff.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that the parameters of a potential agreement are clear.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case that we have not seen a proposal, besides the President\xe2\x80\x99s, that achieves the balance that the President insists be part of a deal -- because we can\xe2\x80\x99t have a situation where deficit reduction is borne unduly or primarily by the middle class or by seniors, or by families with children who have disabilities or kids trying to go to school.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize discussions beyond that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, frank and direct and deliberate.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve used words like that, and that remains the case.\xc2\xa0 But our goal here is to have an environment that maximizes that possibility of an agreement that works for the American people and that achieves the goals the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back in the summer of 2011, the President at least considered a different inflation measure -- the slowing of the rate of adjustments, the so-called chain CPI.\xc2\xa0 But in the package September 19 that was submitted to the Hill on tax increases and cuts, that formula was not adopted.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us right today what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on a chain CPI?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific policy proposals.\xc2\xa0 The principles the President has brought forward in this process are clear.\xc2\xa0 The spending cuts that he has put forward are clear and specific, as are the revenue ideas that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.</p>\n<p>As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 He also understands that his bill will not, as written, likely be what the final compromise, if there is one, looks like.\xc2\xa0 But he insists and will insist, before he signs anything, that there is the balance that he seeks, that is fair, and that seniors aren\xe2\x80\x99t bearing the burden so that the wealthy bear less<br/>\n\t-- those who can afford it most bear less; that the middle class isn\xe2\x80\x99t stuck holding the bag so that the wealthiest pay less.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not a balance the President thinks is fair to the American people, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not one that makes economic sense in the long term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to conclude, then, that since they weren\xe2\x80\x99t included and he\xe2\x80\x99s not including them now, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of the conversations or proposals that may or may not have been put forward as part of them.\xc2\xa0 The principles that I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined are what is guiding the President now.</p>\n<p>Yes, Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike asked you about Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring Republicans along on an idea.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what outreach and hand-holding and temperature-taking the White House is doing with Democrats to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to the parameters of any -- on the spending side?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, a compromise that meets the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles and the objectives of deficit reduction that is done in a way that protects the middle class and seniors, and asks the wealthiest to pay more, will require tough choices by all sides.\xc2\xa0 It will not be a deal that any single person or either party is going to say reflects exactly what they wanted.</p>\n<p>The President speaks frequently with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and as well as Democratic lawmakers in general.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be guided by the principles that he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out and to seek and hopefully achieve a deal that is big enough to really make a dent in our deficits in a way that puts us on a fiscally sustainable path, because that is good for the economy and good for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that deal just has to be structured in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t protect the wealthiest by shifting burdens to seniors, for example, or students or the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he believes we can find a deal that should earn the support of Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You talk about the complex solutions, but looking here as an outsider, as a very sympathetic outsider, I see that the United States is basically the only country in the world -- major, developed country -- that has these terrible, recurring attacks -- criminal attacks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve lived through similar things in Russia, but those were terrorist attacks.\xc2\xa0 The criminal attacks --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your question, Andrei?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is:\xc2\xa0 The solution is basically known, not even talking about the freedoms that Jake asked and I asked, that the President now asked.\xc2\xa0 Without gun control -- okay, question -- (laughter) -- the question is, when you look at the solutions --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought you were going to ask me about permanent trade relations.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you look at the solutions, will you consider the experience of the outside world, the experience of other countries that do prevent such things?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President is going to engage the American public and -- in trying to find a solution, or solutions, to the scourge of gun violence so that the kinds of things that happened -- or what happened in Newtown, Connecticut don\xe2\x80\x99t happen again in the future.\xc2\xa0 I think that this is -- the comparative issue is not in the forefront here.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is what steps can we take, working together, to try to address this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he heard from his colleagues around the world about this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He had not on this issue that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on this, quick question.\xc2\xa0 Brianna was talking about the potency of the moment.\xc2\xa0 Is the President eager to talk about this in his inaugural address -- that kind of outline of where we can go forward --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details to give you about how or when the President will address this issue in coming weeks, except to cite what he said yesterday about doing so in coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I also ask, did the President talk to any other leaders on the Hill today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other conversations to read out to you today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Susan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the timing of this horrific event and the nation mourning, and we have that sort of juxtaposed against this fiscal cliff deal -- does that put any more pressure on you -- sort of on Washington and the different players, the President and Speaker Boehner -- to sort of get their act together, get a deal together?\xc2\xa0 Does it put more pressure on?\xc2\xa0 Because the nation is watching what Washington is doing right now as the President is speaking about how important it is to do something to discourage the gun violence, to do away with the scourge of gun violence.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s coming at the same time, so my question is, does it put more pressure to get a deal done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that that is an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that, echoing what the President said, that what happened in Connecticut reminds us truly of what matters most and what really matters in our lives, and it is also true that we have other challenges that have to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And I think one of the reasons why it would be such a good thing if an agreement could be reached on these fiscal and budget issues, is that it would send a signal that Washington can function and that compromise can happen.</p>\n<p>That was true -- that is true more narrowly if the House would simply pass tax cuts for the middle class that supposedly House Republicans want as much as the President and Democrats want.\xc2\xa0 But it would also apply broadly to a bigger deficit reduction deal if one were achieved.</p>\n<p>I think that on that issue, on the issue of gun violence, and on issue after issue, most Americans out in the country do not look at this as which side is up and which party is winning, but is Washington functioning and is it working in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country and good for them.</p>\n<p>So I hope that whatever the issue is, that we can come together and respond to that call and that desire.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s how the President feels.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:07 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
