EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I need to get a shot clock up here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You never -- obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Romer who made you on time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, I am -- the President and Dr. Romer are very good examples, and I thought I\'d follow their lead, Chuck.</p>\n<p>I want to do two quick announcements, and then I will turn this over to Dr. Romer, the chair of the President\'s Council on Economic Advisers to talk about the report -- Economic Report to the President.</p>\n<p>The first announcement earlier today, President Obama called to congratulate President-elect Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica for her recent electoral win.\xc2\xa0 The President reaffirmed his commitment to working in close relationship with Costa Rice on issues of mutual interest, including clean energy, climate change, and security for the benefit of both countries and for the people of the Americas.</p>\n<p>Secondly, on February 18th, the President will meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\xc2\xa0 The meeting will take place in the Map Room here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The Dalai Lama is an internationally respected religious leader and spokesman for Tibetan rights.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to an engaging and constructive dialogue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any coverage on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why in the Map Room?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is the best place that the President felt and the team here felt for the meeting to take place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Diplomatic considerations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Diplomatic considerations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Deciding not to have it in the Oval Office --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No President has met with the Dalai Lama in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Now I\'m going to turn it over to Dr. Christy Romer, who will talk to you a little bit about the economic report that the President will sign in about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>So, Dr. Romer.</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Well, it is a pleasure to be with you all.\xc2\xa0 You have to know that for a chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, there\'s no bigger day than the day that her first Economic Report of the President comes out.\xc2\xa0 So anyway, so that is what brings me here.</p>\n<p>I think for anyone who is not a devoted fan of the economic report, I thought it would be helpful to give just a little bit of background.\xc2\xa0 So the Employment Act of 1946 set up the Council of Economic Advisers to bring the best professional advice to the President on economic matters.\xc2\xa0 It also mandated -- or said it was the role of the federal government to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power, and that every year the Council of Economic Advisers of the President were to submit a report to Congress saying how we were doing.</p>\n<p>And so this year\'s economic report is the 64th, I believe, in this line of classics.\xc2\xa0 Each economic report does three things:\xc2\xa0 It talks about the challenges, the economic challenges that we face as a country; it talks about what policies were put into place in the previous year and how they worked, and it lays out the President\'s economic agenda going forward.</p>\n<p>I think -- I like to think that this year\'s economic report is particularly important, not because of me but because of the times that we are facing.\xc2\xa0 I think if you think about the economic challenges that we face, there\'s probably not for a very long time been as great a set of economic challenges.</p>\n<p>And of course, these span all the way from of course the immediate crisis, right?\xc2\xa0 When we came in, if you remember back to a year ago, we were losing close to 800,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 Real GDP was plummeting.\xc2\xa0 Our financial system was certainly very stressed, and there were real questions about what would be happening.</p>\n<p>But we also know that there was a reason that the President had run for President on a lot of economic issues even before the economic crisis -- things like stagnating incomes for middle-class families, soaring health care costs, the fact that as an economy we were failing to invest adequately in educating our children for the jobs of the future, investing in innovation and other things that would help us to grow faster over time.</p>\n<p>All right, so I think that certainly makes this volume particularly important to document the challenges that we face.</p>\n<p>The second thing that I think is so important about the volume is to put down in one place all of the economic actions that we\'ve taken.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not a surprise by far the longest chapter in the economic report is on the rescue, just simply because this was an economy in a terrible crisis.\xc2\xa0 But it really goes through laying out not just the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but what the Federal Reserve did, all of the policies for financial stability, our housing program.</p>\n<p>But then it also goes through the policies put in place in a lot of other areas.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s so easy when we\'re all caught up and thinking about what\'s going to happen with the health care reform bill that is before the House and the Senate, to remember back that we passed the reauthorization of the Children\'s Health Insurance Program that brought health insurance coverage to an additional 4 million children.</p>\n<p>And we just go through all of those kinds of accomplishments.\xc2\xa0 We\'re in the middle of doing financial regulatory reform.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s remember we passed the credit card bill last spring to try to deal with some of the consumer issues there.</p>\n<p>And so it really is, in one place, getting a sense of the tremendous amount that has been accomplished.</p>\n<p>And then of course it lays forward the President\'s economic agenda.\xc2\xa0 And here -- I think one thing that is I think so important to keep in mind, as an economist, the way we think about economic policy is, you know, what is the problem going on in the private market that creates a role for government.\xc2\xa0 And so talking through what are some of the market failures in innovation; what are some of the market failures present in our health care system that give a role for government; what\'s the motivation behind the President\'s agenda.</p>\n<p>But I think one of the things, again, it\'s so helpful to see the agenda as a coherent whole.\xc2\xa0 And I think it does paint a picture of a very well-reasoned, very important agenda for moving this economy forward.</p>\n<p>In terms of themes, I think it will sound very familiar to you.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one, certainly, that the President has talked about -- rescue.\xc2\xa0 There are two chapters, both on what we\'ve done in the United States, what\'s been done in other countries.\xc2\xa0 There are three chapters in what I like to refer to as the rebalancing.\xc2\xa0 This is what the President often refers to as getting away from bubble and bust and thinking about how are we going to grow more healthfully going forward.\xc2\xa0 And that is things like we\'re pretty sure that consumers are probably going to be saving more in the future, and that\'s probably a good and healthy thing.\xc2\xa0 But it raises a question of, well, where\'s the demand going to come from?</p>\n<p>And so the President has talked about the importance of spurring investment, the importance of spurring exports as a way of making sure that there\'s demand to keep people employed.</p>\n<p>There\'s of course the budget deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big part of the rebalancing, that at the same time we\'re going to spur investment, we\'re going to spur net exports, we do need to put in place a plan for getting our long-run budget deficit under control.\xc2\xa0 And here I think the economic report has a very nice chapter about where our long-run deficit problem came from, about what -- the reason that one would be concerned about it, what it does to the economy; the logic for the kind of fiscal anchor that we have talked about, or the fiscal target that\'s talked about the budget; and our concrete proposals for dealing with it.</p>\n<p>I\'d also put in the end of bubble-and-bust financial regulatory reform, and there\'s a very nice chapter talking about where financial crises come from, what financial intermediation is and why it\'s important, and the logic of the administration\'s financial regulatory reform proposal.</p>\n<p>And then, finally, there are four chapters on what the President often refers to as rebuilding the economy stronger, that wanting to make sure that when we come out of this crisis, we don\'t just go back to where we were but to something better.\xc2\xa0 And that is exactly health care, education, the transition to clean energy, and spurring innovation and trade.\xc2\xa0 All of those are things that we think can make the economy stronger going forward.</p>\n<p>The last thing I\'ll mention, just in case you\'re wondering what\'s unique about this, the 64th Economic Report of the President, come back to the idea --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s yours.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s true.\xc2\xa0 But I think much more than that is, it is the times -- that I think that it is a time when economic issues are so incredibly pressing.\xc2\xa0 And I think that makes it special.</p>\n<p>I also want to -- I think methodology is somewhat different.\xc2\xa0 One of the hallmarks, I think of the Obama administration is the reliance on evidence.\xc2\xa0 I often say that you win a policy argument not by shouting the loudest or talking the most but by having the best arguments.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a tribute to this President and this policy process.\xc2\xa0 And so in this economic report we try to put forward the good arguments for the policies that have been proposed.\xc2\xa0 There\'s some original research in here, and there are also, for the first time, references, so you can see the studies that are behind some of the things that we have been thinking about.</p>\n<p>And the last thing I\'ll say is it\'s prettier than ever before.\xc2\xa0 So, first time it\'s been printed in color.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to be the first time, staying with our accessibility and transparency, it will be available in electronic form for your Kindle and your Sony Reader and whatever.\xc2\xa0 So everybody on the beach will be reading the Economic Report of the President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>All right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What beach?\xc2\xa0 The white beach.</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 So, you want to take it from here, Robert?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll direct some traffic for you.</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Romer, one figure that just leaps off the page from this report is that even after job growth returns, you don\'t see unemployment coming down to 6 percent until 2015.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that a pretty bleak assessment of what six years of the Obama presidency is going to deliver?</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 So the first thing to say is to remind you this is exactly the same forecast that you saw a couple weeks ago when we did the budget, right, so it is the administration forecast.\xc2\xa0 And as I think we described at the time, we had -- we tried to do an honest, conservative forecast to make sure that we were basing our budget numbers on sort of as close to the consensus and reasonable forecast as we can.</p>\n<p>I think it is important to realize that certainly when we did this forecast, we had a placeholder in there for some targeted jobs measures, but certainly when things were still very fluid.\xc2\xa0 And I know for, in particular, the Council of Economic Advisers are very enthusiastic about the small business jobs and wages tax credit, and certainly things that are now moving through both the House and the Senate in that kind of area.</p>\n<p>I think that\'s the kind of a proposal that might have the chance of moving the dial, of being particularly effective.\xc2\xa0 So I think what\'s really going to matter is you\'re right that the forecasts are certainly something to be concerned about, and that\'s why the President has said job creation, more of these movements are going to be important going forward to make sure we can get that down as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, let me just add to that, too, as we\'ve discussed the chart that I handed out on Friday, the hole that we\'re climbing out of -- it currently stands at 8.4 million lost jobs deep, right?\xc2\xa0 Again, taking the recession in 1981, 1991, and 2001, they don\'t cumulatively equal 8.4 million jobs.</p>\n<p>So what people -- most people I think recognize as the worst downturn in our economy in most memories -- 1981 -- combining that with the most previous two doesn\'t equal the downturn in the economy that we saw.\xc2\xa0 The job growth alone isn\'t all of it.\xc2\xa0 You looked at -- we had the -- I think the statistic I saw, that I probably got from Dr. Romer, was that you had consecutive quarters of more than 5 percent, more than negative-5 percent economic retraction for the first time since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s important to understand the sheer size and the magnitude of what we\'re dealing with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What you just said leads naturally into what some of the critics are saying this morning, which is that what you\'ve just described as documenting the challenges is really an exercise in blame-shifting.\xc2\xa0 Is it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we lost 763,000 in January of 2009 isn\'t blame-shifting; it\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we were, as Dr. Romer said, averaging 700,000 jobs lost a month in that quarter is a fact.\xc2\xa0 The fact -- the notion that we are now where we are losing -- in November we had positive job growth, but we\'re getting much closer to the margin of zero -- that\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t blame-shifting.</p>\n<p>Look, there are millions of people in this country that have lost their job.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve lost their job because we had a risky financial system of which the President wants financial regulatory reform to lay down rules of the road so it never happens again.\xc2\xa0 We had a bubble-and-bust economy, again, another chapter that they\'ll talk about, where we thought somehow job growth could be predicated on the availability to get an American Express card or a housing loan.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to get fixed overnight, and it\'s never -- under the President\'s ideas, not going to happen again.\xc2\xa0 What we have to do is lay a foundation for the fact that, how do we address for the fact -- for largely for the last decade, we didn\'t create jobs and people saw their wages either flat-line or stagnate.</p>\n<p>Those are monumental challenges.\xc2\xa0 Whose fault it is will be decided largely by history.\xc2\xa0 But there are 8.4 million people that don\'t care about what history decides.\xc2\xa0 They want a job.</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 I just want to add, exactly what the entire report -- it is all facts, right?\xc2\xa0 It is just simply -- it\'s not trying to shift blame, it\'s just trying to say here are the challenges that we face.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s fundamentally -- it\'s what the economic report is supposed to do.\xc2\xa0 It\'s saying what\'s the motivation for the policies going forward.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Caren.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the numbers that that is new in the report is the forecast for 95,000 payroll creation, and that\'s a pretty tepid growth.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering, are you saying that if you get the jobs bill that you think the jobs growth can be stronger than that, or does it already assume that?</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 So the first thing to say, that 95,000 is very consistent, say, with other forecasts.\xc2\xa0 I think the blue chip just came out yesterday -- they asked a special question -- they think on average in 2010 it\'s going to be 116,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re very much in the range of other forecasts.</p>\n<p>What I was saying is that is I think a reasonable estimate.\xc2\xa0 It\'s our best estimate going forward.\xc2\xa0 It did not have in place -- it didn\'t take into account the specific form of any jobs bill going forward.\xc2\xa0 We know there\'s still a lot of uncertainty about what will come out of Congress.\xc2\xa0 At the time we did the forecast there was even a lot of uncertainty about what exactly would be proposed.</p>\n<p>So that was certainly the case.\xc2\xa0 The reason we\'re proposing things like small business lending, the jobs and wages tax credit, the energy retrofit program, is because we think those will be particularly effective.</p>\n<p>And so I think what the President is going to do is to put in place the best that we can, working with Congress, and then see if we can get better performance.\xc2\xa0 That of course would be what all of us are hoping for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also respond to the Republican argument that what is holding back people from hiring is the uncertainty about legislation on health care, cap and trade, and things like that, that\'s making businesses more cautious?</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 I think, having talked to a number of business people -- especially I really found our jobs summit incredibly useful -- what I certainly hear from business people is the main uncertainty that they face is the economy -- it\'s not legislation, it\'s not any of that -- it is, is the demand going to be there, is the economy going to grow and be strong?</p>\n<p>And, you know, I think that is exactly what the President has focused on.\xc2\xa0 And by doing the kinds of policies that he has proposed and wants to continue, I think that\'s going to be the main thing that helps us to resolve that uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 Just the more we can get good growth like we\'ve seen in GDP, I think that\'s going to help with a lot of the uncertainty.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does your jobs forecast, the 6 percent, does that assume no jobs bill gets passed this year?\xc2\xa0 Does that assume no more government stimulus, new stimulus, or --</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 So the -- I mean, certainly this is -- the forecast that went into the budget, and certainly it\'s designed to be a post-policy forecast --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You assume that some jobs stimulus --</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 So we pad in the $100 billion targeted kind of thing, but it didn\'t have the format.\xc2\xa0 And I think one of the things that I\'ve tried to describe is I think we have some ideas for a particularly good format.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about housing foreclosures a little bit?\xc2\xa0 There was another number that came out today -- and I assume it\'s addressed a little bit in there -- but are you concerned that this number is going to keep growing since there were so many -- you guys put some temporary halts in it and then now over the next few months it\'s going to grow?\xc2\xa0 And when does it stop growing, this foreclosure number?</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 So certainly foreclosures are a big issue.\xc2\xa0 Housing in general is a big issue.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s discussed in both chapter two on the rescue, but also chapter four kind of going forward what do we think is likely to happen sort of as we go back to full employment.</p>\n<p>Obviously housing has been sort of a major part of where this crisis started, with the decline in housing prices and the problems certainly there.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'ve had a very aggressive housing program, and again that\'s described certainly in detail in chapter two.</p>\n<p>I think going forward that is certainly -- it is one of the headwinds that we\'re facing.\xc2\xa0 I mean, part of the reason why even -- we are seeing growth but part of the reason coming out of this recession most people are forecasting a number like 3 percent GDP growth in 2010 is we do know that we are still facing headwinds.\xc2\xa0 It has been just a terrible recession and part of that is the financial crisis, part of that is getting lending back, and certainly part of that is going to be these persistent problems in housing.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is going to be something that we\'re working against.\xc2\xa0 We do think we have good policies in place, but it is going to be something that we\'re going to have to be working to deal with.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said overall this is a conservative forecast, and you of course may recall that there was a time when you issued a report I think it was 8 or 8.5 percent unemployment you said would be the max -- and it went up of course to 10 percent.\xc2\xa0 Was there an effort here to avoid being overly optimistic so that you didn\'t get burned politically down the road?\xc2\xa0 And has anybody in a senior position -- the President or anybody else in the White House -- ever said to you, hey, err on the side of conservative rather than optimistic so we don\'t get burned politically?</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, every time we try to do the best we can.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- the truth is we don\'t have a crystal ball.\xc2\xa0 Every year we try to do an honest, reasonable, conservative forecast to make sure that we are basing our budget assumptions on the best possible forecast that we can.\xc2\xa0 We try to inform our decisions by looking at what other people talk about.</p>\n<p>One of the things I do want to mention, though -- I think I mentioned it at the budget press conference and Peter Orszag said that\'s economist for "I told you so" -- because we did take a lot of heat last year for both our GDP forecast and our unemployment forecast.\xc2\xa0 And I will absolutely say the unemployment forecast, like many people, we did not forecast how high the unemployment rate would go.</p>\n<p>We were actually remarkably accurate on the GDP forecast.\xc2\xa0 So actual when we have the numbers in, we now know that over 2009 real GDP grew by 0.1 percent, one-tenth of 1 percent.\xc2\xa0 Our prediction had been for three-tenths of 1 percent.\xc2\xa0 So were in fact quite accurate on the GDP forecast.</p>\n<p>One of the things that we talk about in the economic report is just how this recession has been unusually hard on the labor force and the degree to which the usual relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate has broken down somewhat, and that the unemployment rate has risen much more than one would have predicted based on the behavior of unemployment.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And also, Chip -- we had an occasion to talk about this on many outings here -- nobody predicted what we saw at the beginning of the first quarter of 2009.\xc2\xa0 Nobody saw 763,000 jobs lost.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we didn\'t see 763,000 jobs lost because there was a revision that took us from 740,000 to 763,000.</p>\n<p>So these numbers are constantly being revised.\xc2\xa0 But I think the bottom line is when Dr. Romer and Dr. Bernstein came out with that, nobody had a full grasp -- us included -- on just how deep this was.</p>\n<p>Now, that\'s not to blame anybody -- that\'s just to understand that the severity, the slope at which we saw job loss, was unforeseen not just by us but by virtually everybody that enters into the type of forecasting that these guys enter into.</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say one thing?\xc2\xa0 You\'ll actually see a table in the economic report in chapter two that actually shows you what other people were forecasting at the same time we were doing our forecast, to kind of give you just the facts on the degree to which the world was changing very quickly.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Every day.</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 And so I have one minute before I get to go get this baby signed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, she\'s got to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on income inequality, the report talks about inequality but doesn\'t make any specific recommendations on it.\xc2\xa0 How seriously should the administration be treating that right now?</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 I think that is an issue that I know the President feels deeply about.\xc2\xa0 We have a whole chapter on strengthening the American labor force, because that\'s where we certainly talk about, certainly in terms of this recession, the degree to which different demographic groups -- young people, blacks and African Americans -- all that have seen higher unemployment rates relative to the average.</p>\n<p>I think very much the message of that chapter, and I know it\'s one, again, I\'ve heard the President talk about, is how important education is in trying to even the playing field and trying to prepare all of our children for the good jobs in the future.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is certainly a big part of certainly where I see our economic agenda trying to make roads in that area.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got to let Dr. Romer go for --</p>\n<p>DR. ROMER:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 Enjoy your reading.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Dr. Romer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I come back to WellPoint, which the President raised the other day?\xc2\xa0 And also because, you know, Secretary Sebelius wrote that pretty toughly worded letter saying, justify all this stuff.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve responded.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve said basically it\'s because healthier people are opting out, they\'re getting cheaper coverage elsewhere, so we\'re losing money.\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I thought they made -- because I saw -- I think they made a $2.7 billion profit last year.\xc2\xa0 So maybe that\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re not satisfied with their explanation.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\'s economic parlance for just breaking even.\xc2\xa0 But, look, when health care inflation goes up at 4 or 5 percent, when a company makes a $2.7 billion profit and turns around and increases rates in the individual market by nearly 40 percent, I think there\'s some explaining and some investigation that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>I think it also underscores more than ever why the case that the President made about helping people particularly on the individual market, why that\'s so important; that creating a national exchange, a national pool, that can have a greater amount of purchasing power -- one of the things that the health care reform bill called for -- is obviously needed in this region of the country and, quite frankly, throughout the country.</p>\n<p>I will look through and get a more detailed response to the letter.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the response that they wrote.\xc2\xa0 Just again, understanding that health care inflation is not nearly rising at that level, though their profit looks quite nice.\xc2\xa0 I think more needs to be explained at how that number was derived.</p>\n<p>Caren.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House warned earlier this week about a crackdown in Iran surrounding the anniversary of the revolution and there have been reports of a crackdown.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you could give your reaction to what\'s going on there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we continue to monitor events as they happen and try to get the best available information, understanding that a lot of media, Google, and other Internet services have been basically unplugged.</p>\n<p>I think the President was very clear in his speech in Oslo that we stand by the universal rights of Iranians to express themselves freely and to do so without intimidation or violence.\xc2\xa0 Iranians have gone out into the streets to do just that in a peaceful way.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to monitor it and continue to express our condemnation and dismay for any violence that should result as -- should happen as a result of the exercising of those universal rights.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned the Google suspension.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard directly from Google about this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should check with NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 I saw some emails around this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was based off of news reports or based off of something that NSC had gotten.**</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow on Iran?\xc2\xa0 The head of Iran\'s atomic energy agency, Ali Salehi, has just in the last few minutes cautioned the President against taking what he calls "wrong steps."\xc2\xa0 He said, "The consequences are beyond the imagination of anybody.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t test Iran."\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think Iran has made a series of statements that are far more political than they are -- they\'re based on politics, not on physics.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 The Iranian nuclear program has undertaken -- has undergone a series of problems throughout the year.\xc2\xa0 Quite frankly, what Ahmadinejad says -- he says many things and many of them turn out to be untrue.\xc2\xa0 We do not believe they have the capability to enrich to the degree to which they now say they are enriching.</p>\n<p>I would also say this.\xc2\xa0 If they are serious about the peaceful use of their nuclear program, then what they should have done was taken more seriously the offer on the Tehran research reactor, understanding that the increase in -- the increase from 3.5 to nearly 20 percent was what the United States and the IAEA and its partners offered as part of the Tehran research reactor so that medical patients could have access to these medical isotopes.\xc2\xa0 Iran cannot replace and continue to operate the TRR at its current pace.</p>\n<p>So then not taking the IAEA up and its partners up on a very commonsense offer leads, quite frankly, the world to believe that Iran has other ideas.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why -- and I would say this -- the reactions -- the actions of Iran have led the world to be more unified than at virtually any other point in the past many years.\xc2\xa0 They have brought forward, through their actions, through their statements, our partners in the P5-plus-1 now moving in accord forward to taking those next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there another deadline, new deadline for them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you saw yesterday the Treasury institute some sanctions on the IRGC, and obviously the next phase in this -- as the President talked a few days ago, this is multifaceted and there will be more phases to this, including the United Nations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, the deadline was the end of 2009.\xc2\xa0 Why should the leaders of Iran think that there are any consequences for disobeying what the United States and the IAEA and the P5 want, given that, with the exception of the move by Treasury yesterday, there have yet to be consequences?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- and look, Jake, as you said, the President is working through and with our partners on making that happen.\xc2\xa0 This was not going to happen in Time Square when the ball hit zero.\xc2\xa0 This was always going to take some important time.\xc2\xa0 But understand this, Jake, our allies in this are more united than they\'ve ever been to take actions and consequences based on the statements and the actions of the Iranians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have China on board yet for U.N. sanctions, through Security Council?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Chinese have and will continue to play a constructive role.\xc2\xa0 They worked with us, again, very constructively on the U.N. resolutions dealing with North Korea, and we believe, and I think they believe it\'s not in their interest to have a worldwide arms race; it\'s certainly not in their interest economically to have an arms race in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a no?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, that\'s not really an answer to whether or not they\'re on board.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are working through with them, with our other partners in the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 This will go through a process at the United Nations --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When does that process start?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It already has.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when is the public process start of bringing sanctions forward --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the process of writing this and devising these, as you know, has already started, Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the question not whether or not China will support sanctions but what kind?\xc2\xa0 Or are you still working on whether they will support --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the back-and-forth of diplomatic negotiations, understanding, again, that it\'s in everybody\'s interest not to have an international arms race.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this is a difficult time, a tense time already with China, and you have the problem that you\'re talking about right now, you need China\'s help on Iran and many other issues.\xc2\xa0 Why proceed with the Dalai Lama meeting, which you know will infuriate them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jill, we\'ve said this all along.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we talked to the Chinese about their currency in Beijing; we talked to the Chinese about the Dalai Lama in Beijing; we talked about Internet access and Internet freedom with the Chinese both in Shanghai during the town hall meeting and in Beijing.\xc2\xa0 We think we have a mature enough relationship with the Chinese that we can agree on issues that are of mutual interest, but we also have a mature enough relationship that we know that two countries on this planet are not always going to agree on everything and we\'ll have those disagreements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a couple things in the news that I was wondering if you could comment on.\xc2\xa0 One, could you talk about why General Jones is in Pakistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other one is there\'s been some reporting about a Haiti recovery commission with Bill Clinton supposedly being asked to head up that effort.\xc2\xa0 Is there --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an answer to that.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up with the question I asked Dr. Romer -- not looking back so much at the incorrect -- understandably incorrect -- or understandably perhaps incorrect projections on unemployment, but whether or not anybody in the White House has advised her to be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- more conservative rather than --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s never come up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 To what degree does the administration -- not just based on the report -- attribute the job growth, the 95,000, to Recovery Act and any other legislation that the President is pushing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- and I can see if Dr. Romer -- I doubt she\'s broken it out to that degree.\xc2\xa0 Obviously she has, CBO has, underscored the job growth that we\'ve seen under the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 I think the Recovery Act also spurred economic growth, which we\'ve seen now two consecutive quarters of positive economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We did know this:\xc2\xa0 We were never going to have jobs growth without first having economic growth.</p>\n<p>So I think the Recovery Act has created additional jobs and created an environment for economic growth that we believe will ultimately lead businesses to add to their payrolls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the White House respond favorably to a request for federal disaster aid for states in the Mid-Atlantic -- Maryland, D.C., Pennsylvania, Delaware?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to prejudge what they might ask for.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a process whereby those disaster declarations come from the states, or in the District\'s case, the mayor, to FEMA, and all of those are evaluated.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have seen an extraordinary amount of winter weather here in the Mid-Atlantic\xc2\xa0 -- having shoveled my driveway now what seems like 10,000 times, I can testify to that.</p>\n<p>I don\'t want to prejudge what might be in -- what each locality might ask in particular for.\xc2\xa0 The process, though, is that those declarations come from the state and locality, in the case of the District of Columbia, to FEMA and then they are evaluated there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the way Washington and the metro areas have handled the snow removal?\xc2\xa0 And the only reason I bring it up is not for pedestrian concerns, but because the federal government has been closed for four straight days.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m reminded, again, as I shovel my driveway, that there are no statistics on record -- or they did not keep -- if there were snowfall that exceeded what we\'ve had this winter it happened before they kept statistics on snowfall during the winter.\xc2\xa0 So I think everybody understands that what we have seen here is extraordinary.</p>\n<p>Look, obviously it has been an overwhelming weather event.\xc2\xa0 I know that OPM and others are working to try to get as much cleared so that the federal government can open again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the government considering asking federal workers to make up their snow days?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with OPM.\xc2\xa0 I need to check with OPM on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President out there shoveling the walk?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because he\'s the luckiest man on the planet.\xc2\xa0 I told him that on -- (laughter) -- I told him that this weekend, that, you should never leave, it\'s a great deal; you\'ve got a huge driveway and it\'s -- my back is killing me.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Christine Romer said, the longest chapter in the Economic Report is the chapter -- chapter two on the response to the crisis.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s message at the beginning of the report is unusually long.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you think that this is a more political document than past economic reports, and if you\'re using this as a justification for policies rather than just an exposition of the state of the economy.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think as you saw Dr. Romer, this is the first time this has been annotated with references as to where facts were derived from.\xc2\xa0 This is a factual report to the President on the state of the economy and where it\'s headed.</p>\n<p>Jonathan, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a report from Dr. Romer to justify taking extraordinary action to save our economy:\xc2\xa0 763,000 people in January of 2009 lost their job.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think you need more evidence that something had to be done.\xc2\xa0 And I think we know this:\xc2\xa0 that had nothing been done, that hole that I talked to Mark about would be far deeper.</p>\n<p>I think what one of the things this report I think helps many of you all understand is, again, the genuine severity of what we were dealing with, and what we still are dealing with.\xc2\xa0 And the recession started, mathematically, in December of 2007.\xc2\xa0 We are still at a period where we still have not seen consistent positive job growth.\xc2\xa0 This was economic devastation, again, unseen since the late 1920s.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Bond accused the White House of using John <br/>\nBrennan for political purposes, saying that he was being -- doing the role, your role.\xc2\xa0 This economic report --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just address that.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s understand this:\xc2\xa0 John Brennan has been working in counterterrorism for more than 25 years -- right?\xc2\xa0 First as a CIA agent hired by President George W. Bush to work at the CIA, and then to stand up the National Counterterrorism Center.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 We asked him to stay on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the slightest idea what political party John Brennan is a member of.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never had a political conversation with John.\xc2\xa0 I know this:\xc2\xa0 John is there each and every day working in his office to try to do everything he can to keep the American people safe.</p>\n<p>And I would suggest, whether it\'s to Senator Bond or others on Capitol Hill, that these are decisions best left to people that have an understanding of counterterrorism, experience in counterterrorism and law enforcement, rather than to politicians on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But his specific accusation was that he was being used in a way that a press secretary is supposed to -- I mean, that he was enunciating Obama\'s policy.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Kit Bond didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\'t think Kit Bond liked to hear what he already knew, which was he\'d been told that Abdulmutallab was in FBI custody after what happened on Christmas Day.</p>\n<p>Now, I\'ll let you, Jonathan, ask Kit Bond whether he understands the protocols of how the FBI deals with suspects enough to understand that at that point it would have been obvious he would have been read his Miranda rights.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether Kit Bond was confused or whether he just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit the facts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the President sign the debt limit bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s some discussion of him doing that at either the end of this week or over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 I would say this:\xc2\xa0 I think that that bill also contains something --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PAYGO.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- exactly -- that he has spoken for many times, a very simple concept of paying for what you want to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he will do it publicly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the coverage plans are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Caren\'s question regarding Google, is there any concern now that Iran\'s actions following Google\'s dispute with China could indicate that regimes are now going to be targeting U.S. companies and Internet freedoms in general as a means of tighter control?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s been happening for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think this is -- I don\'t think access to the Internet and to open communications is something that has just happened recently.\xc2\xa0 I think this has happened for a while.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President in Shanghai speak out about it as it related to China.</p>\n<p>I do not have specifics around the degree to which Google brought any of its concerns to us about what was happening in Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not whether -- not whether it\'s escalating with Iran now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with NSC and see if they have anything more particular on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President -- he\'s meeting with Secretary of State Clinton later today?\xc2\xa0 I guess she\'s going to the Middle East this week.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be setting any goals for her for that trip?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this is part of their weekly meeting.\xc2\xa0 I assume there will be a number of topics that will be discussed.\xc2\xa0 She and others are traveling in the next few days and few weeks to the Middle East, and we want to continue to make progress and get these two parties back at the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more question.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a report out of Damascus that Syria has accepted the President\'s candidate for ambassador there, Robert Stephen Ford.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that he has nominated Ford or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that.*</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get back to all of us on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President told Bloomberg BusinessWeek, in the context of the conversation about dealing with the deficit and this commission he\'s going to set up, "The whole point is to make sure that all ideas are on the table, so what I want to do is be completely agnostic in terms of solutions."\xc2\xa0 That was in -- the write-up of the interview suggests the context of whether or not he would be willing to raise taxes on those Americans -- individuals earning less than $200,000 --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me read what he said at the -- when he was asked the question the first time.\xc2\xa0 "I don\'t want to prejudge the commission because the whole point of it is to make sure that all ideas are on the table, and let\'s see what folks can come up."</p>\n<p>So what the President was saying, which I think -- the President will set up a commission.\xc2\xa0 The President is not a member of that commission.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to prejudge the outcome of a commission that he\'s setting up on an issue as important as getting our deficit and debt under control.\xc2\xa0 That\'s up to the commission.</p>\n<p>And I would say this, Major.\xc2\xa0 I hope that -- we hope that Republicans, many of whom supported this commission before they had to vote on this commission, and then they magically didn\'t support this commission, we hope that when the President signs this executive order and announces his picks for this commission, that they will demonstrate their seriousness in dealing with an issue of this magnitude by taking part in that commission.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline on that, is it still going to be this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The snow got us a little off track, so it\'ll be in the next 10 days or so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is not prejudging compare with what he said during the campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s not a member of this commission.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has demonstrated through cutting taxes for middle class families and for holding the line on -- the President doesn\'t believe our economic growth should be predicated on raising taxes on middle class families.\xc2\xa0 But that being said, the President is just not going to get in the game of prejudging the outcome of a commission that, one, hasn\'t been set up and hasn\'t met.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He remains opposed to any tax increase for those he outlined during the campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does, and he\'s not going to prejudge what the outcome of the commission will be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that make him an atheist instead of an agnostic on that matter?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to check on that, but I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had a lengthy conversation with Savannah and Todd this morning on Abdulmutallab, and I want to ask you one question about that.\xc2\xa0 If Abdulmutallab or a case very similar to that -- I know each case was different; presents different facts and different scenarios -- would you handle it the way it was -- this case was handled?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 We\'re quite comfortable with the way this one was handled.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into hypotheticals, Major, because this case is different than what happened, obviously, on September 11th.\xc2\xa0 This case is different from the details of what happened with Richard Reid.\xc2\xa0 It\'s hard to compare apples to oranges, in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing you implied is that there\'s also after action, there\'s always a look back -- and in the process of looking back --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- have you found room for improvement or methodologies that might be executed differently?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that John Brennan has been tasked in a process to implement changes based on the report that the President originally got on intelligence failures.\xc2\xa0 And the President asked for us to examine all of what was done that day and in the days after to ensure that we were doing this the best way possible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s role.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he asked everyone to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a rare alignment, MoveOn.org, Paul Krugman and Bill Kristol all agreed the President was wrong when he said he does not begrudge Wall Street bonuses.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t say that, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying what they\'re saying he said.\xc2\xa0 He said "success" -- "I don\'t begrudge success, I don\'t begrudge --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s not play hypothetical.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 He said, "I don\'t begrudge their success, I don\'t begrudge their wealth."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI, like most of the American people, don\'t begrudge people\'s success or wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, read the question, too, because the question was about -- the question was about the bonuses.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I read the questions.\xc2\xa0 You and I talked about this like four times the other --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but the question was about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I understand the question was about bonuses.\xc2\xa0 The question -- and the President on five different occasions -- just as I emailed you yesterday, causing you to reexamine what you\'d written based off of the interview -- that the President was talking in that sentence, as he\'s done many times, about -- he does not believe the federal government should be setting salaries for business in America.\xc2\xa0 He still believes that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he still remain comfortable with the analogy he made with Major League Baseball players many have pointed out -- yes, Major League Baseball players make a lot of money -- no, many of them will make the World Series, but none of them had anything to do with the financial crisis or bad --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think the President would argue that not many baseball players had anything to do with the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s -- the point he was trying to make was that there are obscene and shocking salaries, and obscene and shocking compensation that don\'t match what happens with your performance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Blankfein and Dimon count?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, let me -- can I just -- let me finish my answer -- that the President has said that there ought to be -- these ought to be based on performance, not on risk-taking, okay?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some of these new ones are.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that -- right, in the sense that yes, they\'re in stock rather than in --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Long-term health.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There should be a say on pay.\xc2\xa0 Shareholders ought to be able to weigh in on this.\xc2\xa0 And he said that salaries like you were talking about with baseball and these bonuses are extraordinary and shocking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Blankfein and Dimon -- are those obscene bonuses, Blankfein\xe2\x80\x99s and Dimon\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken repeatedly on these bonuses, and finds them, as he did in here, extraordinary and shocking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been asked specifically about Blankfein and Dimon?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And he said extraordinary and shocking, specifically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they obscene, are they an offense, are they a violation of our moral principles?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\'t have any different view on bonuses yesterday than he had 10 days ago or 10 months ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are these more palatable because these are different in type from the ones that were not linked to long-term health stock?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ensuring the bonuses are paid in that way is a movement in the right direction, right?\xc2\xa0 Does that justify the level of these bonuses when, through only -- only through the taxpayers\' assistance, would these banks still even exist?\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Senator Corker has said that he wants to help out with the financial regulatory reform bill.\xc2\xa0 Senator Grassley is participating in the jobs bill.\xc2\xa0 How do you account for this apparent bipartisan good will?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the snow may indicate that it\'s all frozen over.\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think -- look, I think -- let\'s take these individually.\xc2\xa0 Look, the finance committee has worked -- is working in a bipartisan way on a series of measures to create an environment where hiring can take place, as well as to extend things like unemployment compensation and health care for people that have lost their job.\xc2\xa0 Senator Corker has been very active in this process, in the process of financial reform.</p>\n<p>I think there are certainly many in this town that want to deal with the problems that people face, whether it\'s creating jobs or whether it\'s ensuring that we have rules for the road that protect against the type of excessive risk-taking that led to the near collapse of our financial system, and with it our economy.</p>\n<p>I hope that many have learned the lesson that you hear and see people talking about all the time, and that is that they want this town to put aside its petty arguments and move forward on what\'s important in their lives.</p>\n<p>The President used an example the other day with Senator McConnell about appointments -- that at this point in President Bush\'s tenure, there were six nominees that had been sitting there for a month or more, right?\xc2\xa0 This President, before today\'s action in the Senate, had 63; as he said to Senator McConnell, both a quantitative and a qualitative difference.</p>\n<p>I think that all of these are examples of things that are examples of things that are important to people\'s lives -- that they believe Washington should put aside, as I said, the petty games that normally take up the time in this town to get something down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that people talk about these things all the time, but the President has been talking about them more and more this year.\xc2\xa0 Are they responding to that kind of political pressure from the President?\xc2\xa0 Do they seem to be responding?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re responding to both the political pressure of the President.\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re also responding to the political pressure from the American people.\xc2\xa0 They have -- the President went to Capitol Hill -- tried to go to Capitol Hill to talk to House Republicans about the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve talked about in here, they put out a statement opposing that plan before the President even got to Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 The President spent a lot of time trying to work with Republicans on health care, only to have very few respond.</p>\n<p>The President will continue to try to do this in an effort to demonstrate to the American people that this town is capable of solving the problems that we face.</p>\n<p>Helene.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Haiti?\xc2\xa0 One question on Haiti?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Helene first.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you, just to go back to Iran first for a minute --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go back to?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the sort of rhetoric that\'s been coming out of the Iranian leadership in the past week in particular, has the President had any sort of rethink about the whole concept of engagement with Iran?\xc2\xa0 I know you said that, you know, you think this outreach --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because, Helene, we wouldn\'t be here -- we would not be here unified in the P5-plus-1 were it not for engagement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, and I see that argument, but what about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So putting aside that we\'re at a point in which those countries have never been more united and more forward in dealing with the threat from Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet from China and what they\'re going to do.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, but you wanted me to leave aside the united --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to put aside the united front in the P5-plus-one and ask you to look specifically about the relationship with the Iranian regime as a whole, between the United States and Iran.\xc2\xa0 Do you see any difference there that perhaps has come from an engagement and do you see, is there any rethink about whether or not there was any -- has gone anywhere at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, I think it demonstrated to the world that these were decisions that weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be made by the United States or by Russia or by China, these were decisions that were going to be made by the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 Now, sometimes it\'s been confusing; sometimes they\'ve accepted ideas and agreements only to come back a week or so later and not accept them.\xc2\xa0 And whether or not there is one or two voices in Iran speaking for the Iranian regime, or whether there are many conflicting voices, I\'ll let others decide.</p>\n<p>But because we engaged, it demonstrated to the world that the choices that Iran made were choices that it alone had to vouch for.\xc2\xa0 The Tehran Research Reactor is, again, a good example.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to run out of the type of medical isotopes that they need to treat those in their country that could be helped by this.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 If your program is one for peaceful needs, why not accept the help of the IAEA in ensuring the health and safety of your people?\xc2\xa0 I think, again, their walking away from that agreement demonstrates for the whole world to see what their intentions really are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quick -- U.S. wants Iran to stop their nuclear weapons program, but Iranian President is firm on their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And they said that sanctions have not worked in the past, so how now sanctions will work?\xc2\xa0 And what do the future --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a much longer discussion, Goyal.\xc2\xa0 I think that this is a process that has begun at the United Nations and I don\'t want to get too far on that.</p>\n<p>You want a Haiti question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one thing.\xc2\xa0 From what you\'ve observed so far, do you believe that the Haitian government has properly carried out the judicial process concerning those Americans who are being held?\xc2\xa0 And also, under the circumstances --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to point you to State, because I have not had a lot of time to look at the Haitian judicial process over the course of many days.\xc2\xa0 But I know they\'ve had contact with the Haitian judicial system and with those missionaries, so I would point you over to State on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the Vice President last night said that Iraq could end up being one of the President\'s great achievements.\xc2\xa0 Given that the Vice President was in favor of a partial partition of the country and the President opposed the surge that helped stabilize it, how is that one of the President\'s great achievements?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, putting what was broken back together and getting our troops home, which we intend to do in August of this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Status of Forces Agreement to bring troops home was signed before the President took office.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Something that -- something that I think the political pressure that the President, as a then-candidate, helped to bring about.</p>\n<p>Look, I think that we will long debate Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We will long debate whether at a very important moment in our efforts to root out terrorism particularly in Afghanistan and on that border region with Pakistan, whether we took our eye off the ball.\xc2\xa0 I think historians will debate that long after we\'re gone.\xc2\xa0 I think they will come likely to the conclusion that no single event took our eye off of what needed to be done in order to -- in order to occupy a country that, until we got there, didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a single member of al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>So, look, obviously -- look, the Vice President has been deeply involved in fixing the political process there so that elections can be held and so that our troops can come home as scheduled this summer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if you are the average Iranian and you\'re hearing about the possibility of more sanctions, what can you do to reassure him or her that the sanctions will be targeted against organizations associated with the government and not them specifically?\xc2\xa0 And are you worried that these sanctions, if you do pursue them and they\'re carried out, will only serve to solidify the hold of the Iranian government over the people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the government\'s hold over those people I think -- in the streets over the past many months is in many ways called into question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into the specifics of what is being worked through, except to say that obviously we do not want to see a backsliding in progress and to do things that risk putting the political changes that are clearly happening in that country -- to see them fall back.</p>\n<p>All of that is being taken into account even as the world demands not just that the Republic acknowledge the universal rights of its citizens but also that it live up to their agreements around their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann has called the February 25th Blair House meeting nothing but a PR stunt.\xc2\xa0 My question is do you know for sure, have you been told that the Republican leadership is going to attend?\xc2\xa0 Have they accepted the invitation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with Legislative Affairs.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they have said they would come or not.\xc2\xa0 Bill, it would be an awfully curious thing that the argument that they made up until the point in which the President proposed this was that the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sat down -- despite the record -- sat down with Republicans enough and talked to them about health care -- I can\'t imagine a conceivable scenario in which, after having that invitation, you would say, well, I know for nine months I said I wanted that, but I can\'t possibly fit it into my schedule now.\xc2\xa0 It just seems silly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you proceeding then on the assumption there will be a meeting and there will be Republicans at the table?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it would be -- well, it would demonstrate a lot about the willingness of those to actually solve a problem for the American people.</p>\n<p>I know sometimes polls don\'t get a -- when there are good numbers in polls they don\'t get a lot of attention in this town. But The Washington Post poll from a couple of days ago had a number very similar to that of the poll that they did of voters after the Massachusetts election, and that is that a overwhelming majority wanted to see the effort to reform health care continue. I think that\'s important.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President wants to meet with individuals in both parties to talk through these solutions.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two questions.\xc2\xa0 Basically hours after the President said he was considering using recess appointments Senate Republicans filibustered Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board.\xc2\xa0 The first question is, has the President given thought to appointing Mr. Becker through a recess appointment?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, has anyone at the White House been in touch with either Senator Harkin or Senator Udall on their proposals to essentially reform the use of the filibuster in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about the second question, Sam.\xc2\xa0 I can simply recount the story again that the President at the meeting a couple of days ago -- I think it was probably the last 20 or so minutes where the President, during the bipartisan meeting, asked very specifically about the reason and the nature for the hold-up of many qualified appointees that weren\'t being held up because of some philosophical or political disagreement.\xc2\xa0 There were, again, 63 that had been sitting for more than a month, when in a comparable period of time in the Bush administration that number was six.</p>\n<p>Senator Shelby last week decided to put a hold on everybody because he didn\'t get a couple of earmarks.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s obvious now that that wasn\'t such a good idea, and he pulled back many of those holds.</p>\n<p>The President told Senator McConnell quite clearly the situation that we have is, again, as I said, quantitatively and qualitatively different that it was at the beginning of the Bush administration; that it had to change and that if it didn\'t change the President would use his power for recess appointments.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s where we are now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any specific discussions about Craig Becker?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There wasn\'t a specific discussion about any individuals.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President discussed those that had been laying over for more than a month.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:10 P.M.
