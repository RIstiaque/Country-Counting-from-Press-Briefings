EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So let me just give you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to walk through the schedule.\xc2\xa0 Ben is going to walk through a couple of different aspects of the visit.\xc2\xa0 General Lute and Tom Donilon are getting ready to brief the President, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to them after the bilateral meeting at the embassy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do a readout of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo just as a scheduling update, we are scheduled to land around 8:25 p.m. at Bagram.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re about 35 minutes pushed back from where we were, just as a point of reference.\xc2\xa0 So let me just quickly go through the schedule.\xc2\xa0 Most of it is what we went through, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take you through it again. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOnce we land we will go to the helos.\xc2\xa0 We will pick up at Bagram General Petraeus and Ambassador Eikenberry.\xc2\xa0 We will then lift in the helicopters to ISAF and the embassy, to a landing zone there, and then we will board into the motorcade for about an approximately 10-minute motorcade to the palace.\xc2\xa0 There will be a brief arrival at the palace. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will start the bilat with a quick pool spray with President Karzai and some brief statements from the two.\xc2\xa0 Then for about 45 minutes they will -- the two of them in addition to General Petraeus, General Lute, Ambassador Eikenberry, Tom Donilon, will meet with President Karzai and his delegation in what\xe2\x80\x99s listed as a working dinner. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will then motorcade back to the embassy.\xc2\xa0 I think as I told most of you guys in our pre-meetings on this that the President will then spend about half an hour with embassy staff. We do these on all of our foreign trips, akin to an embassy meet-and-greet to thank them for their service. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will at that point get back into the helos and go to -- go back to Bagram.\xc2\xa0 The President will be greeted by commanders at the base before heading off to the main troop event with a couple thousand from the 101st Airborne.\xc2\xa0 And General Petraeus will introduce the President. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President will then likely go visit wounded soldiers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more information on that likely at the back end.\xc2\xa0 As I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a readout on the bilateral once we\xe2\x80\x99re back at the embassy and holding.\xc2\xa0 So after he does the hospital greet we will load up and head back to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do a refueling stop at Ramstein.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point is the embargo lifted -- is it after the spray?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Katie Lillie or I -- once we land and we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of set and the President is on the ground, Katie Lillie or I will give you guys that this trip is reportable and you can go.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That will be in Kabul, not Bagram?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That will be in Kabul.\xc2\xa0 So, again, you guys will all be in a group.\xc2\xa0 When you hear from either myself or Katie Lillie, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to go.\xc2\xa0 But not until.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the whole schedule is reportable?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the whole schedule is reportable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will be before the bilat?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it will be before the spray.\xc2\xa0 For those who went last time, we did -- there was an arrival ceremony.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate something like that this time because it will be much colder outside.\xc2\xa0 But basically right as that started we gave a go. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is he going to take any questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to meet privately with Petraeus and Eikenberry while he\xe2\x80\x99s on the ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the helo with him on the way from Bagram.\xc2\xa0 But I do anticipate that he will spend some time with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, is the bilat with Karzai, then the working dinner, or they\xe2\x80\x99re the same thing? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re largely the same thing.\xc2\xa0 The pool spray you\xe2\x80\x99ll see will be the two of them.\xc2\xa0 They may do a few minutes of one-on-one time but then they\xe2\x80\x99ll go into a larger -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s four or five people total on each side. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut, again, I would stress that the focus of our trip is really to see the troops and to see those who work at the embassy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a bad weather call.\xc2\xa0 So we might have to move the whole program out to Bagram.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMS. MASTROMONACO:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re below weather minimums for the lift right now, so they\xe2\x80\x99re making a weather call and it looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try and move everything to Bagram.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s heavy -- is that why the weather call is below the minimum<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMS. MASTROMONACO:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s dust and everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So just forget everything I said and pay absolutely no attention to that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It was all set -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve known about the bad weather. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Take two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Start all over. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Let me just give a few points for introduction.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you -- what they\xe2\x80\x99re working now is to see how much we can move to Bagram.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on that, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Including me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The principal reason for the trip -- we started planning this over a month ago, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, with Alyssa.\xc2\xa0 And the reason was to go during the holiday season.\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to find the time in between Thanksgiving and Christmas when he could go out to spend some time with the troops in particular, and our civilians in Afghanistan, basically to wish them happy holidays. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s a particularly tough time of year for -- it\xe2\x80\x99s always tough to serve in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re away from loved ones in the holiday season, it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly hard.\xc2\xa0 And the President wanted the ability to come out and have some time with them during the holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJust to give you a sense, just a quick sense of the kinds of sacrifices that Americans are making in Afghanistan -- we were going to go to the embassy, which we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to do last time, but we wanted to do that to underscore the civilian service because there are over 1,000 American civilians serving -- American government civilians -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include contractors, obviously -- serving in Afghanistan from the State Department, USAID, and some -- about nine other agencies.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a number that has tripled since President Obama ordered a surge in our presence in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMost of these civilians, of course, have families back home that they\xe2\x80\x99re separated from as well.\xc2\xa0 Most of them will serve upwards of a year during their time in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Some of them, about a quarter, serve 18 to 24 months, so there\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary sacrifice that our civilians make as well as our military.\xc2\xa0 And many of them are at the embassy, but many of them are also out in the field with our military or with PRTs serving in very difficult circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt Bagram, just to give you a sense of the sacrifice of the troops there and our broader military in this holiday season, the principal component will be the 101st -- as Robert said -- the 101st Airborne Division, parts of that division, although we do expect there to be components of all the services.\xc2\xa0 When the President visits like this they tend to try to bring in components of the different services.\xc2\xa0 But the bulk of the troops he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to are from the 101st.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe 101st Division Headquarters is on its fourth combat deployment in this time of war.\xc2\xa0 That included the first invasion and occupation of Iraq, included a second tour in Iraq, then a 15-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2008 and 2009, and now again in Afghanistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously not all the troops who he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking to have been part of the 101st the entire time.\xc2\xa0 Presumably some have.\xc2\xa0 But this will be the fourth holiday season in which the 101st Division Headquarters has been in combat, so it speaks to, during this period of almost 10 years of war, how much these men and women have sacrificed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOf course, a lot of our military, roughly half of them, in the Army, for instance, have families back home that include kids.\xc2\xa0 So we know this is a sacrifice not just for them but for their families back home, and the President will be speaking to that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, above all, we wanted to underscore their sacrifice at a time of year when Americans are coming together as families to mark the holiday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe visit also comes at a time in which there have been a number of milestones around Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Some of you were with us in Lisbon just a couple weeks ago, where the President had the ability to meet with President Karzai, so he\xe2\x80\x99s just recently met with him.\xc2\xa0 So this continues their consultations.\xc2\xa0 But at Lisbon, we felt we had a very successful outcome that achieved really three principal goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFirst, all of ISAF\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for trainers were met by new commitments, so we filled what had been a trainer gap in terms of the capability necessary to support the Afghan security forces. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSecond, we agreed on a framework for a transition that identifies early 2011 as the beginning of a transition to lead for security in Afghanistan to Afghan forces.\xc2\xa0 As you heard us say in Lisbon, that transition will begin in early 2011 and it will conclude in 2014.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, NATO-ISAF transition begins earlier in the year.\xc2\xa0 So we expect that there will be certain parts of Afghanistan that will begin to transition earlier in the year.\xc2\xa0 The American transition begins in July of 2011.\xc2\xa0 So in July of 2011, the United States, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, will begin a conditions-based transition and removal of troops from Afghanistan from our surge levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe ISAF transition, generally speaking, including the United States, will be complete in 2014.\xc2\xa0 So that process of transition that was outlined in Lisbon was a key business that was done in advance of this trip. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd then lastly, in Lisbon the NATO-Afghanistan Partnership Declaration also underscored that even as we were undertaking this transition, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to build a long-term commitment to Afghanistan, to its security and stability, both through our continued and enduring support for their security forces and also through the long-term bilateral partnership that the United States will build with Afghanistan and that the coalition will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd then the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d highlight is that we are also approaching or in the process of conducting a national security staff-led review.\xc2\xa0 This is the December review that you all are familiar with.\xc2\xa0 The President, when he rolled out his strategy just one year ago the other day, called for monthly check-ins and assessments with his national security team, in addition to the weekly written reports he receives from the field.\xc2\xa0 So each month, as you know, he meets with his national security team to get an update on the strategy.\xc2\xa0 As a part of that process of assessment, he asked for a comprehensive assessment of the strategy in December, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been tracking up towards that assessment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in recent weeks, this is a process that is diagnostic in nature.\xc2\xa0 This is not a policy review similar to the one that was undertaken last year.\xc2\xa0 We have a strategy in place; this is a process that will assess that strategy and review the need for any adjustments.\xc2\xa0 But these adjustments, again, won\xe2\x80\x99t be of the nature of a policy overhaul, but rather to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking a hard look at everything that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, assessing what\xe2\x80\x99s working well, assessing where we could do better. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of that review.\xc2\xa0 The review, frankly, does build upon the foundation of what was done in Lisbon since there was a lot of inputs that came into Lisbon from both our team in the field -- General Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry, as well as our ISAF partners.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of that review.\xc2\xa0 We expect a series of meetings that are ongoing right now in the interagency process.\xc2\xa0 The President will have meetings with his national security team in the upcoming weeks, and then we expect a completion of that review before we leave for the holidays later this month.\xc2\xa0 So we expect the results of that review to be announced by the President in the week before we leave for Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What week --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would anticipate that it\xe2\x80\x99s the week of December 13th, whatever the beginning -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the 13th to the 18th or something like that is the work week.\xc2\xa0 So I would expect it to be that week. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presidential speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a major speech.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is not analogous to the policy review that we undertook last year.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more of an assessment process.\xc2\xa0 So I would expect it would be a lower-key rollout with a statement and then some briefings by the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team on top of that to update the American people on the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made, what we see as the areas where we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward well and areas where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be putting additional focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, it comes at a time where we have seen some progress, particularly on the security side.\xc2\xa0 In and around Kandahar, for instance, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some success in challenging some Taliban strongholds and clearing out some areas that were traditionally held by the Taliban, just as we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some success in targeting Taliban leadership through our operations in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that has to be complemented by the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to train Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 And there we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some success in meeting -- improving targets.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing challenge.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that we can build up the Afghan capacity on the military and governance side that can sustain these security gains.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo those are the kinds of issue we\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President prepares for that -- how important is this for him to see firsthand -- (inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this is really about that.\xc2\xa0 This is about thanking the troops and the civilians.\xc2\xa0 So his ability to -- again, he was able to meet at length with President Karzai in Lisbon.\xc2\xa0 He was able to speak the General Petraeus at some length in Lisbon.\xc2\xa0 He meets with his national security team regularly.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll do so as well during the process review.\xc2\xa0 So obviously his ability to have ongoing conversations with General Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry while he\xe2\x80\x99s here, and President Karzai, are part of the process of keeping updated on what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in Afghanistan, but this is -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize this as a trip associated with this review.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis trip was designed, again, just to thank the troops and our civilians.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a separate process to provide inference to the review.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- who is heading up this review process and when did they start?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is -- first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just tracking, it\xe2\x80\x99s inputting to the review.\xc2\xa0 So Doug Lute -- and this is a national security staff-led review, so Tom Donilon, the National Security Advisor, has the lead, with Doug Lute as our principal staff person on Afghanistan has been coordinating this effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat Doug has done is pursued the inputs -- his team has received inputs from across the government, from the Pentagon, from the State Department, from the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 So those inputs have fed into this process and now there\xe2\x80\x99s an interagency period of discussion.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been ongoing for several weeks now as part of an information-gathering process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, it\xe2\x80\x99s helped by the fact that we already have a feedback in these monthly meetings and weekly reports. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s assessments feed directly into this process and inform again what is really an assessment review.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be drawing from that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did this start?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that process started in kind of mid-October and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The assessment started in October?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the kinds of taskings that went out and the kind of identification of what inputs would be useful.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of those, of course, have now come in and we believe that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re now in a period of an interagency process and meetings that will guide the outcome. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except for generally wanting to thank the troops and express his appreciation for them, was there anything the President said he specifically wanted to get out of this trip, either with interactions with the troops in particular or more broadly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That was really it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had the ability to do -- again, focus a large portion of time in Lisbon on Afghanistan, to consult with allies, consult with President Karzai, consult with our team.\xc2\xa0 He has his monthly meetings on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So this trip is really just about thanking the troops and our civilians during the holiday season.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before we were leaving there were more disclosures from WikiLeaks about President Karzai, about the strains in the relationship there.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that comes at an awkward time?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that may add to some of the tensions in the relationship as the two leaders talk?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with a series of public discussion around some of the challenges in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There have been books, there have been previous WikiLeaks revelations related to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve weathered those kinds of revelations before as it relates to our relationship with President Karzai and the Afghan government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think we\xe2\x80\x99re all well aware that there are serious challenges in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough fight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a country that is trying to recover from many, many years of war, predating even 9/11.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve had ups and downs in terms of the kind of public revelation of information associated with the challenge of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But I think precisely the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with some of the very specific stories associated with the latest WikiLeaks disclosure -- and through these WikiLeaks disclosures and through these books and articles -- I think it allows us to be able to weather this and continue to move forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is making sure that our two governments are aligned behind the strategic objective, which, again, is breaking the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, building up Afghan capacity, and undertaking a transition that both ensures that there\xe2\x80\x99s never a safe haven for terrorism in Afghanistan as it was before 9/11 and that the Afghan people can control their own future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me add, as Ben said, the challenges on either the security side or the governing side are not new and they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not unknown.\xc2\xa0 What unites both sides is, what Ben just alluded to, which is our goal of providing safety and security, our goal of ridding the Taliban, al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates from the ability to use Afghanistan as a safe haven to plan attacks on our country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the challenges are known; the goals are known.\xc2\xa0 And we are pleased to be making progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re billing this trip mainly as a trip to talk to the troops.\xc2\xa0 But what is going to be his message to Karzai when he meets with him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that he met with President Karzai for an hour or more less than two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 So their discussions there, they are focused on this framework for transition, for -- and on the kind of long-term partnership that was advanced by ISAF in Lisbon. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think these discussions will build on that.\xc2\xa0 Again, President Karzai is aware that the reason for the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visit, is to, again, be with our troops and civilians.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for them to continue their discussions.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able, when they do meet and when they do talk by SVTC, to make sure that our approaches are aligned.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s I think been the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s interactions with President Karzai -- to make sure that even as we have inevitable challenges that come up in a war, that we understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving towards the same target and our approach to issues like transition and security and governance are aligned.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd Doug will give you a readout of the meeting, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a major -- precisely because they met so recently, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we come with kind of a major new piece of business we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get done.\xc2\xa0 Because a lot of the agreements that we wanted, again, on transition and on the long-term partnership were just recently reached in Lisbon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) -- President Karzai?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check on that.\xc2\xa0 What we do is we plan this pretty far in advance internally, but we, as you know, have to keep a very close hold on it for security reasons.\xc2\xa0 We inform the embassy a period of days out and then the embassy informs President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Karzai mention anything in Lisbon about inviting him back or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He would have definitely been informed after Lisbon. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say come and visit --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in Lisbon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A scheduling update.\xc2\xa0 We are still going but the program is going to look a lot different.\xc2\xa0 We will land at Bagram as planned, motorcade to the 101st Airborne Headquarters.\xc2\xa0 At the 101st Headquarters, the bilat will be by secure video teleconference.\xc2\xa0 So right now the ceiling and the wind make travel very difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a pool spray of the SVTC.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see the video image of -- after that, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have Eikenberry and Petraeus with us.\xc2\xa0 The President will then go to the hospital and see eight patients -- five soldiers, three civilian contractors -- award four Purple Hearts.\xc2\xa0 He will then move over to -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the updated timing on this -- the troop event. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will work on making sure that all this stuff is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s time on the end to feed video --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long will we be on the ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMS. MASTROMONACO:\xc2\xa0 Three hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we report what the schedule had been, that he was going to go to the embassy, he was going to go to the palace?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When are we actually going to be able to say that were at Bagram?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me talk with these guys.\xc2\xa0 We may be able to give more of a -- let me double-check, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the same protocol, either from me or Lillie, it\xe2\x80\x99s a go.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll find that out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe schedule -- God only knows what the schedule is now -- but we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to land in approximately one hour.\xc2\xa0 So we will update you as things might happen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does the weather, not meeting in person makes a difference, whether there\xe2\x80\x99s something lost, whether --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, again, just because they were able to meet recently.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it would be nice to be able to share a meal together.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, they were able to meet face to face less than two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 They speak by VTC fairly regularly, kind of on a quarterly basis at least, so they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly accustomed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 So while it would have been nice to share a meal, I think President Karzai understood that -- I think that was on the schedule for about an hour, which is about what their VTCs usually run.\xc2\xa0 So I think President Karzai understood the purpose of this was really for the President to spend with the troops.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to have a discussion, but they were able to see each other face to face a couple weeks ago, within that time. So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The whole thing at the palace was only scheduled for -- the meeting itself was 45.\xc2\xa0 So my guess is we\xe2\x80\x99re somewhere between 30 and 45. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t9:57 A.M.
