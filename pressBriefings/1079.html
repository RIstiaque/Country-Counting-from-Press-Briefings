EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So I hope you all got a chance to watch the President deliver his speech announcing that he will produce for Congress the American Jobs Act, which, as you know, is comprised of a series of measures that have historically garnered bipartisan support, that will be judged by outside economists, we believe, to be -- to have a very positive impact on the economy and on the employment situation in America, if Congress acts.</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven the fact that these are measures that have had bipartisan support in the past, that have proven to have a positive impact on the economy in the past, that are reasonable, practical, and paid for, we certainly hope that Congress will take action on it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how does the President expect Congress to act on the bill now if the pay-fors aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be decided until late November, if at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you misunderstood, Julie.\xc2\xa0 The President will put a bill before Congress early next week -- the American Jobs Act -- and it will contain the pay-fors in it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that that bill is going to pass.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, right.\xc2\xa0 But if the bill passes, it will pass with pay-fors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he wants Congress to pass as a package the jobs bill and the pay-fors?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 The reason why there is a link between the pay-fors and the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99ll put forward to this Congress and the super committee on long-term deficit and debt control -- because he\xe2\x80\x99s asking the super committee to overshoot its target of $1.5 trillion in additional savings by the full cost of the Jobs Act to ensure that the American Jobs Act does not add a single dime to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re linked.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you could do it both -- either way.\xc2\xa0 Our obvious preference is that Congress act as soon as possible on the American Jobs Act, and there will be pay-fors within that.\xc2\xa0 And if that legislation passes, it will lock in those savings.\xc2\xa0 Because, as you know -- obviously, this gets into technical details about how the super committee works and its obligations to come up with the mandated level of savings or get hit with the trigger.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no subterfuge here.\xc2\xa0 It will be direct and specific in the legislation he puts forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more point on this.\xc2\xa0 The recommendations that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give to the super committee, are they going to be just for the pay-fors that he wants them to act on for the jobs bill --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be that and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The whole deal.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and we all lived through, sometimes painfully, in the summer, the President is very committed to a significant, broad-based, long-term deficit and debt reduction done in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And he will put forward proposals that build on the $1 trillion in savings achieved through the Budget Control Act, the end result of that circus.\xc2\xa0 And he will put forward something significant before the committee that is a series of specific proposals to achieve long-term budget and deficit control.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on the proposals for the super committee -- will the President make a speech or is he just going to deliver a package of recommendations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a venue for you or a modality.\xc2\xa0 But he will -- we will present that in some form, in some way, as he said, I believe, a week from Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And following up, do you have any reaction to the reaction from the Republican leadership to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We welcome the conciliatory tone that Speaker Boehner took, Majority Leader Cantor.\xc2\xa0 We think that reflects two things:\xc2\xa0 one, the accuracy of the President\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the measures he put forward are the kinds of measures that have won bipartisan support in the past; and two, that those leaders understand that their constituents, specifically in their districts in Ohio and Virginia, but Americans across the country are demanding action out of Washington, function instead of dysfunction.\xc2\xa0 And their number-one priority is the economy.\xc2\xa0 Their number-one priority is jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo hopefully -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect suddenly for harmony and happiness to break out on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 We do -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect those who are the President\xe2\x80\x99s political opposites or political opponents to do this because he asked them to.\xc2\xa0 We hope and expect they will do it because the American people ask that they do it and demand that they do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is having his jobs speech today in Richmond.\xc2\xa0 Eric Cantor is also doing something in Richmond as well about jobs.\xc2\xa0 Is this going head to head with the Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even aware that the Majority Leader was having an event or -- I take you at your word.\xc2\xa0 His district is in this area.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise that he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking in his district.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to Speaker Boehner since last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President go to Ohio -- (inaudible)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is, indeed.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll go, as he said, all over the country urging Americans to urge their representatives to take action on this essential package of proposals to help grow the economy, help the private sector accelerate hiring so that America is better positioned to compete in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did you pick these two spots because of Cantor and Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We travel all over the country; we\'ll be to a lot of different places.\xc2\xa0 Richmond is a great place to go because I\xe2\x80\x99m a Virginian, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also because --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- anything else?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, because, I mean, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a short trip, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also far enough where you can feel, the President can feel, we can feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re outside of Washington and talking to folks in the country who aren\xe2\x80\x99t obsessed with the gamesmanship and the petty politics of the inside-the-beltway game, but are concerned about their own lives and their economic future.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you shift to the terror threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything corroborated yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We, as you know, have specific information reporting about a specific and credible threat, but not corroborated, not confirmed.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to -- I can tell you that the President was briefed this morning by his Homeland Security Advisor, Assistant to the President John Brennan, by National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough, updated on this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remind you, as I did yesterday, that John Brennan has been running a process for four months, anticipating the need to be extra vigilant, to take extra precautions around this anniversary, the 9/11 anniversary, because, as you would expect, al Qaeda, while it lost its leader when we brought justice to Osama bin Laden, remains a threat to Americans, remains interested in attacking the United States and Americans, and we have to be vigilant against that threat.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, in the raid that was part of the bringing justice to Osama bin Laden, there was information obtained that corroborated what you might expect, which is that al Qaeda is interested in significant dates, and including, of course, the 9/11 anniversary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President take any action as -- after this briefing this morning -- the briefings this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He repeated his instructions to Mr. Brennan and Mr. Donilon, Mr. McDonough, that the whole team redouble its efforts to follow all the information we get, all the threat information we get, and to take all the necessary precautions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any information on what he\xe2\x80\x99s being told about the threat?\xc2\xa0 Is it that it\xe2\x80\x99s linked to New York or Washington, that it has roots in al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to DHS for the specifics that we can go into.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports about some general information about the threat.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new information on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are those basically what the President is being told, though, those reports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Basically -- he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously being told in great detail about a number of matters.\xc2\xa0 But what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard is accurate as far as I understand it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any schedule changes for Sunday, and is there any change --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are no schedule changes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- change to the threat level?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I refer you to DHS, but my understanding is no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody else?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know, or have you heard any of the reports about a few of Muammar Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s close group have shown up in Niger?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I actually did see a report this morning, not internally but externally, a press report that -- in Niger that they -- someone, a high-ranking official -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who it was -- I just glanced at this before we took off -- saying that they would comply with international obligations related to the travel ban on Colonel Qaddafi and his family.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, that would be consistent with our position and the international community\'s position.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:17 A.M. EDT<span style="display: none">\xc2\xa0</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
