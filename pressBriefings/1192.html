EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for being here.\xc2\xa0 This is, I think as advertised, an off-camera but on-the-record briefing we\xe2\x80\x99d like to do for you, one of two previewing the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming trip to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 Today I have Mike Froman, with whom I\xe2\x80\x99m sure most of you are familiar, of the NEC and the NSC, a rare hybrid.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s here to talk about the economic component of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to say that obviously you all have questions about a lot of other issues.\xc2\xa0 I will be briefing later today, so if we could do our best to keep this one focused on the trip, that would be great, because I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the other briefing, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re on for 1:30 p.m., is --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, the other briefing on the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, tomorrow, sorry.\xc2\xa0 There will be -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s another good point, thanks for raising this.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details in a gaggle similar -- a mid-morning gaggle or off-camera briefing focused on other elements of the trip and a full schedule and things like that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I give you Mr. Froman.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And I think you all have the fact sheets on both the region and Brazil, specifically with regard to the economic issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just try and put it a bit in context.\xc2\xa0 First, there\xe2\x80\x99s been tremendous progress in this region economically over the course of the last decade or so.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got countries who have fundamentally sound finances, relatively low inflation, flexible exchange rates, reduced debt, strong banking regulation, deep capital markets, and is playing an ever important role -- or increasingly important role in our economic well-being as well.\xc2\xa0 And so this trip fundamentally is about the U.S. recovery, U.S. exports, and the critical relationship that Latin America plays in our economic future and jobs here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you all know, in Central and South America, there are about 400 million people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been growing at about a 6 percent rate.\xc2\xa0 We export about $160 billion to them.\xc2\xa0 And we have a trade surplus with the region.\xc2\xa0 And that supports about 900,000 jobs here at home.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brazil specifically, with the election of Dilma Rousseff, gives us an opportunity to engage with the new government there and get off to a good start on economic and other issues.\xc2\xa0 Brazil is now the seventh-largest economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 It grew at a 7.5 percent growth rate last year.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s gone from a country that needed an IMF loan just a matter of years ago to now having $300 billion in reserves and having come through the economic crisis in a very strong and stable manner.\xc2\xa0 Fully half of its population is now considered middle class, and that creates a great opportunity for us to engage and sell our products there and have a deeper economic relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As evidence of that, exports have doubled in the last five years to Brazil.\xc2\xa0 In 2010, they were up about 35 percent, which is twice the global average and even faster than our exports were up to Asia.\xc2\xa0 They support about a quarter million jobs here in the U.S., and we have about an $80 billion trading relationship, both imports and exports, which is to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re on a very good trajectory in our economic relationship, but there\xe2\x80\x99s greater potential still to be had.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me just flag a couple areas where we think there\xe2\x80\x99s particular potential.\xc2\xa0 One is in the area of energy, broadly defined.\xc2\xa0 Brazil is going to become a major player in the global energy markets with its recent discovery of offshore oil.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s already a partner and a leader in the renewables area, and we have a deep relationship with them on biofuels, on wind, on solar, on a number of other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the oil side of things, their recent discoveries of reserves are about twice the reserves of the United States, and we have a natural potential strategic partnership with them in that area as we work with them on issues like deepwater drilling safely, et cetera.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On biofuels, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked together both bilaterally and vis-\xc3\xa0-vis other countries doing research on advanced biofuels and the application of biofuels to additional sectors, and we have a strong relationship with them on solar, wind, hydro and a number of areas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second area I\xe2\x80\x99d focus on is infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 As the host of the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, Brazil is expected to invest over $200 billion in additional infrastructure really across the country, and particularly in Rio, but across the country.\xc2\xa0 And we believe we can be a major partner of theirs in terms of providing infrastructure services and infrastructure-related exports as they go about that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just say a word about the visit to Brazil.\xc2\xa0 On the first day in Brasilia, there will be a focus on the economic relationship, and that will be manifest in a couple of events.\xc2\xa0 One is there is a U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum, which we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having a meeting there during the day in Brasilia, and the two presidents will join that meeting and hear a report out from the private sector on their discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama will also be addressing a business summit organized by the U.S.-Brazil Business Council and be giving a set of remarks on the U.S.-Brazil economic relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We expect to have in Brazil Secretaries Geithner, Locke; Chu; Ambassador Kirk; Fred Hochberg, head of the Ex-Im Bank; and Lisa Jackson, head of the EPA.\xc2\xa0 And this will give an opportunity, again, to focus both on our bilateral relationship and the potential there, but also what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with Brazil around the world.\xc2\xa0 Certainly our efforts to build the G20 as the premiere forum for international economic cooperation was founded on the premise that countries like Brazil and the other major emerging economies need to have a seat at the table and play an increasingly important role in international economic matters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We work very closely with Brazil on a whole range of G20 issues, from the rebalancing agenda and the importance of all the G20 countries working to have a balanced recovery to issues like commodities, financial regulation and other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you may recall, coming out of the G20 we reformed some of the governance of the international institutions, and Brazil took up a more important role and a more active role in the IMF and the World Bank; I think they\xe2\x80\x99re now the tenth-largest shareholder at the IMF, indicating its role globally on a number of these issues.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s Brazil.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just say briefly one word about Chile and El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 With regard to Chile, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s an important partner of the United States; we have an FTA with them.\xc2\xa0 In the context of that FTA, our exports grew two and a half times since 2004 when the FTA when into effect.\xc2\xa0 And Chile is a good example of a country that\xe2\x80\x99s gone through meaningful economic reform and continues to grow at a 4 percent rate or so for the last decade.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 El Salvador is a country, also part of CAFTA, where we have an economic and trade relationship with great potential.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues to be addressed there, including development issues and security issues that Ben Rhodes and others will talk about tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we see this -- the three countries really as giving us an opportunity to talk about the importance of the region to the United States, to the U.S. economy, and the great economic potential that\xe2\x80\x99s there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We can start with questions.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding Brazil, Lula had a fairly strong -- favorable relationship with Iran.\xc2\xa0 The new president -- where do you guys view that relationship?\xc2\xa0 And I had a question on Chile, too, if I could.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to comment on Iran, only to say that the election of President Rousseff give us an opportunity to engage with the new administration and to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going off to a good start.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Chile, there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility of a nuclear agreement pact with Chile.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, under the current circumstances, where does that stand given that Chile is also on a fault line?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some debate within -- in Chile itself over whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a favorable thing for them to explore.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think in the context of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Japan there will be opportunities for President Obama to engage all the leaders that he meets in the regions about issues like nuclear security and the security of nuclear -- civilian nuclear power and the safety there.\xc2\xa0 As to the precise agreement with Chile, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still under discussion with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 China and India and others have become major investment and trade players in Latin America in recent years, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense in the region that the United States has been sort of asleep on the job.\xc2\xa0 And is this trip an attempt to address sort of a U.S. need to reengage, in a way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think the statistics that I read out in terms of the growth of our exports and the depth of our relationship sort of belies the notion we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asleep at the job.\xc2\xa0 But this does give us an opportunity to engage directly with the region and to build on the good progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made, to take it to the next level.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there any concern about competition from the Chinese that has become quite fierce in the region?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think we focus on what our opportunities are in the region.\xc2\xa0 Again, take a country like Brazil where we\xe2\x80\x99ve had good discussions both about our bilateral relationship but also about relationships with other countries, including China, in the context of the G20 and the G20 rebalancing agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Chinese investment be an issue up for discussion, say, in Brazil where China is the top trading partner there, and in Chile where it is also I think the number one --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 My guess is that the discussion will range across the whole range of economic issues that the two countries face, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not specifically about China.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that Lisa Jackson is going to be part of the business group going down there.\xc2\xa0 What role is the environment going to play in your discussions for economic growth?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been fantastic growth, but has it come at the expense of the environment?\xc2\xa0 And are there any new environmental initiatives you\xe2\x80\x99re going to try and get going down there so that we protect the environment while we\xe2\x80\x99re working on growing economic growth?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We work very closely with Brazil -- all the countries in the region, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on Brazil, which is where Administrator Jackson will be present -- on clean energy cooperation, sustainable growth.\xc2\xa0 And Brazil is a leader in the field in thinking about sustainable economic growth.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be hosting the Rio Plus 20 conference next year, which, as the name suggests, is 20 years since the original Rio conference, and the focus will be how to ensure sustainable economic growth that takes into account environmental considerations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking with them about a variety of areas where we can cooperate, including clean energy development, biofuels, et cetera.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Froman, following up on this agreement with Chile, is it not a sure thing?\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s still a work in progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still working through the preparations for the trip, so what role discussion of nuclear energy -- civilian nuclear energy at this point remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen two different things that it was going to be signed here before the President leaves or signed there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on it, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And then on sort of a general overall issue, if you read a lot of the commentary that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out of that part of the world, a lot of the commentators -- a number of them are saying he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office for over two years; why has it taken so long?\xc2\xa0 What is the answer to that?\xc2\xa0 And what is the overall -- is there a general message that the President wants to bring to the entire region?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first of all, within the first few months of coming into office the President attended the Summit of Americas in Trinidad and Tobago and has been to Mexico, of course, has been engaged with leaders from across the region, both bilaterally and in the context of other events -- other summits and other opportunities.\xc2\xa0 So I think he has been deeply engaged in the region and this gives him an opportunity to go there again in person to further engage.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the overall message that he wants to bring to Brazil -- is there a common message to all three countries or the entire region?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the overall message is that we view our relationship with the rest of the hemisphere as a critical one, critical to our economic well-being here, to job creation here.\xc2\xa0 Our export relationship with Latin America is one in which more of the goods are produced here in the U.S. for export than, for example, produced abroad for export in, for example, in Asia.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong tie between production and jobs in the United States and our relationship with the rest of the region.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of other areas where we can cooperate with countries in the region, including Brazil, on regional and global issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s an economic, a political, a security agenda to pursue in the region, and we see this as a natural partnership for the U.S. with the major countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President to put the spotlight on free trade during this trip and talk about the value and his hopes for other deals to be struck or finalized?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about the economic relationship and the export relationship we have, the trading relationship we have.\xc2\xa0 In your fact sheet, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see there are seven states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio and Texas, that export more than a billion dollars to Brazil alone.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s spread across the United States with a lot of interest across the states in the -- and the economic relationship there.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing a number of initiatives, both bilaterally and, for example, in the context of Chile, TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in which Chile is a founding member as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk more about the goals, specific goals in Chile and El Salvador?\xc2\xa0 And also about general takeaways, things you -- agreements you have to reach and bring back from this trip?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a briefing on sort of the non-economic parts of the trip, including Chile and El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d simply say with Chile there will be an opportunity to talk about, again, our relationship with them, the benefits that we -- that have accrued to us through the FTA.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a country that\xe2\x80\x99s gone through economic transition and reform quite well, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a partner on TPP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In El Salvador, it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to also talk about our development policy and our development strategy, the one that the President laid out last September, and our work with El Salvador on development issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect in Brazil the issue of our tariffs on their sugar and sugar-based ethanol to come up?\xc2\xa0 And is that an area that the administration is taking a look at?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We have a broad-based dialogue with Brazil on biofuels and areas of cooperation with -- in the area of biofuels, both in terms of what we can do together in terms of research, what we can do vis-\xc3\xa0-vis third countries in terms of helping third-country production, and also looking at new areas where we might be able to use biofuels.\xc2\xa0 All those will be on the agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I imagine the Brazilians may raise the tariff issue, which is an issue of high importance to them, and that will be part of the overall dialogue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that something that the U.S. is interested in looking at or, I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking -- we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in looking at the whole broad biofuel relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not that one in particular, though?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the overall dialogue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julianna.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Laura, can we expect progress in that area or in discussions on ethanol?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we expect an announcement on ethanol tariffs during this trip.\xc2\xa0 I think this is just part of our overall dialogue about how to cooperate on biofuels.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also just on free trade, the region is obviously looking for signals on Panama, on Colombia free trade agreements, and Mitch McConnell said yesterday that he\xe2\x80\x99d be holding up nominees for Commerce or other trade posts until the President submitted South Korea, Panama and Colombia.\xc2\xa0 How does -- does that weaken the President\xe2\x80\x99s political standing as he goes now to South America and meets with leaders there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, I think as the President has said, he, too, would like to get all three agreements passed once we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed the outstanding issues associated with them.\xc2\xa0 Korea, we addressed those outstanding issues at the end of last year, achieved greater market access and a greater balance in the agreement and are now ready to submit that to Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in dialogue over the course of the last month directly with Panama and Colombia about what we think the issues are that they will need to address.\xc2\xa0 And we hope to resolve those issues as quickly as possible so that we can submit them to Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on this CEO summit, will there be CEOs traveling with the President to Brazil?\xc2\xa0 Or will they already be there for the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not traveling with the President.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re there on their own.\xc2\xa0 And just to give you a couple of examples, Cummins Engine, International Paper, Anadarko, CH2M HILL, those are companies that are represented on the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the Brazil-U.S. Business Council is organizing its own business summit and will have I think several hundred business people in attendance at the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And were these timed to the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip?\xc2\xa0 Was the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip timed to these events?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 These were timed to the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do the U.S. and Brazil have a common interest in getting China to move its exchange rate to a more sort of market-based level?\xc2\xa0 And do you see any sort of difference in the way the BRIC alliance will develop with this new Brazilian president who has at least spoken more positively about relations with the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I do think that the U.S. and Brazil have common interests as expressed through the G20 in addressing imbalances, in ensuring that coming out of this recovery there\xe2\x80\x99s balanced demand from around the world, and that countries move towards flexible market-determined exchange rates.\xc2\xa0 There have been public comments by President Rousseff, and Secretary Geithner has had dialogue with his counterparts there as well, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the many issues where we have common interests.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 Number one, Brazil has a very important black population, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if -- to what extent race will be an element of the economic dialogue.\xc2\xa0 And my second question is, at one point, it looked like if there was a government shutdown or a threat of that here this trip might not go off.\xc2\xa0 Now there\xe2\x80\x99s this crisis in Japan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Tuesday and we\xe2\x80\x99re having a briefing, so presumably you\xe2\x80\x99re planning to go.\xc2\xa0 But is there any chance still that this will be delayed, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the contingency planning for that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave -- on the first question, just in terms of the overall themes of the trip -- maybe leave it until tomorrow when Ben Rhodes and others will talk about the day in Rio and things of that sort.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think in terms of the trip, Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that one to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, there is -- obviously the trip is on and the President will be going to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to having discussions with leaders in the region about the range of issues related to our bilateral relationships, related to our regional issues and global issues, including the Middle East and Asia and Japan.\xc2\xa0 And he obviously is capable of maintaining contact with Washington and being constantly updated; National Security Advisor Tom Donilon will be traveling with him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you have to remember that economic growth in the United States is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority, and this trip is, as Mike has been discussing, is very focused on economic opportunities for the United States and trade relationships.\xc2\xa0 So he fully intends to press on with the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it awkward, though, with the rest of the world kind of exploding everywhere but in Latin America, it seems, for him to be in South America when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Middle East and Japan both in such crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura, he\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States, and there are major issues all the time that a President has to contend with, which is one of the reasons why he has such a substantial support framework around him when he travels, when the President travels, to enable him to stay in constant communication and to deal with all the issues that any President always has to contend with.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fully capable of dealing with that on this very important trip, which he considers vital to his overall strategy of rebalancing our approach to national and international economic security.\xc2\xa0 And our relationship with the region is important for a variety of reasons, including economic.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any events that might prompt him to come home early, around the world?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could predict what might happen in the future, I\xe2\x80\x99d be a rich man.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you\xe2\x80\x99re watching in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We watch everything when we travel just as we watch everything when we\xe2\x80\x99re here in the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say how often the issues of the Panama and Colombia free trade agreements come up in discussions with these three countries that we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the failure to move them has any effect on U.S. credibility?\xc2\xa0 And is there -- what would you say the views are in these countries on those agreements?\xc2\xa0 Are they seen as a boon to the region?\xc2\xa0 Or are there competitive issues in those countries that they might not be a hundred percent supportive of those?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think in general the other countries very much want to see the U.S. engaged in international economic affairs and show leadership in international economic issues.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has done that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done that across the issues around the economic crisis, leadership in the G20 and on trade issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think doing what he did with regard to the Korea free trade agreement at the end of last year was an important signal that he wanted to get the trade agreement done but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to accept just any agreement, that it had to meet certain standards, and therefore, turning it down in Seoul and working on it for another few weeks back here allowed him to move forward with that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what he\xe2\x80\x99s done with Colombia and Panama in directing Ambassador Kirk and his team to engage -- enhance their engagement with Colombia and Panama to resolve the outstanding issues as quickly as possible this year and to submit it to Congress immediately thereafter, that is showing leadership.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re actively engaged with that, and I think the rest of the region and the rest of the world is following that with great interest.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can the trip be framed as two trips in one, where you go to Brazil first -- Brazil is a direct competitor, seventh-largest economy in the world -- and then Chile and El Salvador where the message to Latin America will be sent?\xc2\xa0 Is that a way of interpreting it?\xc2\xa0 And how do you think the mood is going to be where the U.S. is coming out of a recession, Latin America wasn\xe2\x80\x99t affected by it, it kept growing, and there is a different attitude towards the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 President Obama is still very popular there, but the countries\xe2\x80\x99 leaders have a different attitude.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t see the U.S. as someone they have to heed to all the time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think on your first question, it may be a better question to ask Ben Rhodes tomorrow in terms of the overall framing of the trip.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d simply say that we view -- the region is a diverse region.\xc2\xa0 It is not homogenous.\xc2\xa0 We recognize that and respect that, and we look forward to engaging with different parts of the region as appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think in terms of the role of the U.S. in the region, you are absolutely right that the region came through the crisis quite well and quite strong.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been good leadership down there.\xc2\xa0 There have been good policies that have been put in place, and that\xe2\x80\x99s positioned the region to play an even greater role in the global economy than before.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome that, and we think that is a source of strength for us and for the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As countries like Brazil see great masses of their population enter the middle class, that\xe2\x80\x99s a market for us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a stable economy.\xc2\xa0 Those are important attributes of having a stable, capable partner both in terms of bilateral economic relationships, but also a partner on global issues.\xc2\xa0 So we welcome the strength that Latin America has shown and look forward to working with them both to deepen the bilateral relationship and to cooperate on other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0 I have a question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the trip is seen as an economic opportunity and as a chance to increase exports to Brazil.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a big concern in the Brazilian government about the deficit, the trade deficit, and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually something that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to address, that it\xe2\x80\x99s been increasing -- the trade deficit.\xc2\xa0 How are you going to reconcile this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think deficits and surpluses go up and down over time.\xc2\xa0 I think the important thing is that we have strong economic ties both government to government and private sector to private sector.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d, again, just draw your attention to a few examples in the fact sheet about companies that are doing deals in Brazil, having developing opportunities there.\xc2\xa0 And Brazil is involved in the U.S. economy as well.\xc2\xa0 It invests here.\xc2\xa0 It supports jobs here.\xc2\xa0 And we see this as an opportunity to develop on both those fronts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we view the trade deficit or surplus at any point in time as a particular problem or area of focus as much as what it shows as the potential for deepening our economic ties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Take two more -- yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the fact that the U.S. government didn\xe2\x80\x99t comply with the trucking issue with Mexico has led some critics, as Senator McCain, to say that this is sending a negative signal to commercial partners to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And also, the fact that the free trade agreement with Colombia has not been approved also led McCain to say the same criticism.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder if this trip is going to be an opportunity for President Obama to reassure his trade partners in South America that the U.S. will comply with (inaudible) under any treaty or agreement with both countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as you know, the Mexico trucking issue was resolved just last month --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After 16 years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 After -- yes, somewhere between 14 and 17 years, depending on how you count.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But it was resolved, after it had eluded previous administrations, both Democrat and Republican.\xc2\xa0 And this President showed leadership by demonstrating that he wanted to bring the U.S. into compliance and work with stakeholders, members of Congress, and of course Mexican officials to have that happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the President goes to Latin America in a very strong position that he followed through on his commitment to bring ourselves into compliance, as well as is now engaged with Colombia and Panama to resolve the outstanding issues there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on security in terms of Central America.\xc2\xa0 Since the countries of Central America have been more corrupted by the drug cartels from Mexico and South America, as (inaudible) has recognized, I wonder if President Obama will be announcing something different besides Merida to Central America.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that for tomorrow to the team that will be looking at the non-economic issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more in the back related to this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just had a follow-up on the question about the yuan as to how much a part of the basket of economic issues with exports it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be, where you would rate it in its importance between the trade deficit and the value of the yuan -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s a focus at all of this trip, if that\xe2\x80\x99s just in the basket of issues, kind of where it stands.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as President Rousseff herself has indicated, issues around other countries\xe2\x80\x99 currency policies and the appreciation of the real vis-\xc3\xa0-vis other currencies is an issue of concern to them.\xc2\xa0 And that underscores the importance of working together on the rebalancing agenda laid out by the G20.\xc2\xa0 So I imagine that will be part of the discussion in the context of what we could do together through the G20.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, anything on Japan -- any Japan update?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said at the beginning, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be briefing in a few hours and will take your questions on other issues then.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the stock market?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
