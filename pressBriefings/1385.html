b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:12 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a few quick announcements.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, the President will host, on April 12-13, the Nuclear Security Summit at the Washington Convention Center here in D.C.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to list for you all a couple of different things -- first, the 47 countries including the United States that will participate in the summit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They include Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 The United Nations, the IAEA, and the European Union will also be represented.</p>\n<p>As part of the Nuclear Security Summit, the President is currently planning to host a number of bilateral meetings.\xc2\xa0 Those include President Sargsian of Armenia; President Hu Jintao of China; Chancellor Merkel of Germany; Prime Minister Singh of India; King Abdullah II of Jordan; Prime Minister Najib of Malaysia; Prime Minister Gilani of Pakistan; President Zuma of South Africa; and President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition to the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities this evening, at the White House the President will host a screening of the documentary film, Nuclear Tipping Point, a film which focuses on today\xe2\x80\x99s global nuclear dangers.\xc2\xa0 The screening will be attended by four distinguished statesmen featured in the documentary:\xc2\xa0 former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of Defense William Perry, and former Senator Sam Nunn; as well as film narrator Michael Douglas, and General Colin Powell, who provides a prologue to the film.</p>\n<p>In the film, Shultz, Perry, Kissinger and Nunn share the personal experiences that led them to write three Wall Street Journal opinion editorials describing their efforts to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons, and to prevent their spread into potentially dangerous hands, and ultimately end them as a threat to the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time is that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is -- I want to say 6:30 p.m., but I will double-check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister Gilani, Robert, not President of Pakistan.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I was wrong when I had it written -- they had it as Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 I will admonish the note-takers for -- and I regret the error.</p>\n<p>With that, I think we\'re done with our previously scheduled announcements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any coverage on the event tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on the mine explosion.\xc2\xa0 The President said that federal resources are already down there.\xc2\xa0 Have there been any federal resources that have gone to West Virginia so far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Mine Safety Division and FEMA both have dispatched teams; they are there.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, spoke with Governor Manchin last evening, pledged our full support and cooperation in the investigation, and that is obviously currently ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this mine seems to have a pretty significant history of safety problems.\xc2\xa0 Is the President considering any review or overhaul of federal oversight over the mines?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first and foremost, obviously our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones and for those that continue to pray for a miracle for those that are missing.\xc2\xa0 So I think rescue and recovery is our -- first in our mind right now.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we want to see obviously a thorough investigation, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the governor and others discuss.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I said, has pledged his full cooperation and resources for that investigation.\xc2\xa0 And I think legislative plans about that might better be addressed at the conclusion of that investigation when we have a few more details about what might have happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for the President to go to West Virginia?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, one on the Nuclear Posture Review and one on the weekend announcement about currency.\xc2\xa0 Starting with currency, after having put off this report, what are the next steps that the administration will take at the G20 or in other fora to press China to move their currency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, obviously as we\'ve mentioned many times, the President has spoken directly with the leaders in China about his concern and his</p>\n<p>GAP</p>\n<p>market-based.\xc2\xa0 There are three important meetings coming up,\xc2\xa0 finance ministers of the G20, our yearly dialogue with the Chinese here being two of those, at which the administration will continue to press the Chinese to, as the President has said, value their currency in a way that\'s much more market-based.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s the way we think is best at this point.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports over the past week or so about the Chinese beginning to take some steps and realize on their own that this is the best path forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you be pressing India or Japan or any other countries in the G20 to get this particular issue on the agenda for the G20?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt this is of great concern to a number of economies around the world.\xc2\xa0 I think the best thing to do is let Secretary Geithner and others work through this process in these upcoming meetings and evaluate where we are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then once that three-month period is over, you come back to this report?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact timing at the end of the meeting period, but we can certainly check with Treasury on that one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And then just quickly on the Nuclear Posture Review -- what is your response to criticism from some who are saying that it just makes the United States less safe by taking a big -- the possibility of nuclear deterrent off the table?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think this is -- first of all, I don\'t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what nuclear deterrent it takes off the table.\xc2\xa0 The document obviously contains no assurance for a country that currently possesses a nuclear weapon or for a country that fails that fails to live up to -- sign the NPT or live up to its obligations, which obviously the two biggest examples of that are Iran and North Korea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think this is a -- and the President believes -- a very logical policy intended to, in many ways, help bring security not just to here but to other countries that have -- live up to their obligations and give up, if they have programs, nuclear weapons. If not, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make themselves less secure.</p>\n<p>So I think this is an important and balanced step, and this is the beginning, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss of now more than a week of events that start with the Nuclear Posture Review.\xc2\xa0 The President travels tomorrow evening to Prague to sign with President Medvedev the next START treaty.\xc2\xa0 And then we return here to focus, as I mentioned, with 46 other countries, on locking down any vulnerable nuclear material over the course of the next four years to ensure that we are not faced with that kind of material falling into the hands of a terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Nuclear Security Summit, what were the criteria for invitations?\xc2\xa0 Obviously most of those countries are not nuclear powers.\xc2\xa0 And is every country sending their head of state?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily, no.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific -- who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be here for each country.\xc2\xa0 For instance, I know that Prime Minister Brown called an election in the United Kingdom and because of that and I think upcoming debates is not going to be somebody who will be attending.</p>\n<p>Let me -- as we get closer to, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a longer briefing on this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a better sense of attendees for each of the countries involved and more information on what the President hopes to speak to each of the countries directly about as part of the bilateral meetings that I said are currently planned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I want to review a quote and get your reaction. \xe2\x80\x9cOur nuclear arsenal helps deter enemies from using chemical and biological weapons.\xc2\xa0 In the first Gulf War we made it very clear that if Saddam used chemical or biological weapons then the United States would keep all options on the table.\xc2\xa0 We later learned that this veiled threat had the intended deterrent effect as Iraq considered its options.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That was Secretary Gates two years ago.\xc2\xa0 He now disagrees with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Gates obviously was heavily involved in the latest Nuclear Posture Review as the current Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 The briefing that was held to unveil it today was held at the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>I would certainly say, as it relates to a country -- there\xe2\x80\x99s two things, as part of the Nuclear Posture Review, that I think are important to keep in mind.\xc2\xa0 If a country -- if we see that a country greatly expands its biological or chemical weapons capability, the posture review calls for the ability to reevaluate any assurances that have been given; and secondly, I think goes without saying that our country possesses a massive conventional arsenal that we believe has an important deterrent effect on anybody that might make the poor decision to attack our country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that was your Secretary of Defense saying that the nuclear threat helped deter Iraq in the first Gulf War from chemical and biological --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the Secretary of Defense was obviously heavily involved in the formulation of the current posture review; extensive meetings with the President on this subject, and something that, like I said, was rolled out of his building today.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, at any time while this policy was being developed, did the President step in and object to something because it would make America less safe?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m not going to get into the -- there were dozens and dozens of meetings, not all of which involved the President but involved principals and deputies from any department in government that had an equity in this review.</p>\n<p>Dan, the President gets up each day with the safety and security of the American people foremost on his mind.\xc2\xa0 So you can be assured that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in a meeting about the latest nuclear posture review, or the President\xe2\x80\x99s daily intelligence briefing, or, quite frankly, walking from the Residence to the Oval Office, the safety and security of the American people are on his mind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a push or pull at any time during that process where he was saying, you know, what you are proposing here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would make America safer?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I think you can be assured that the document that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with is done so in a way that the President believes can best keep this country safe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he actually stepped in?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out.\xc2\xa0 Did he ever step in at any point in the process?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is his document.\xc2\xa0 This is his document.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do have another question on the health care -- the selling of the health care law.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how you feel it\xe2\x80\x99s getting through to the American people.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel it has been effective in knocking down what the President has said have been myths?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is not a 10-day program.\xc2\xa0 This is -- health care is -- the law will be implemented over the course of many years.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not doubt that in the intervening many days, you all will poll every other day to find out whether Joe in Peoria has changed his mind.\xc2\xa0 This is a longer-term effort to reform our health care system in a way that was, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, desperately needed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our implementation and our efforts to ensure that what is laid out in the law is -- that those promises are kept by insurance companies and others will be the focus of this administration, and has been since the moment the President signed that bill.\xc2\xa0 The first meeting the President had with the team at the conclusion of health care reform was to discuss its\xc2\xa0 -- the next morning, was to discuss its implementation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more thing -- on the Karzai invitation, anything change on that -- on the May 12th invitation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I would say that that meeting is still on the schedule as of now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your answer to Jake about the President speaking to each of the countries\xe2\x80\x99 leaders or representatives directly about -- what are you talking about?\xc2\xa0 What agenda items are on the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind for these meetings, these bilats he is going to have?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, each of these -- some of them are -- some of them, obviously, deal with -- directly with our proliferation efforts.\xc2\xa0 Some of them will also deal with the fact that some of these countries we\xe2\x80\x99ve not had a chance to sit down with.\xc2\xa0 Some of them -- there are issues that may lie slightly outside of something like proliferation -- Armenia comes to mind with the normalization of relations.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are a whole host of things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the focus is on nuclear security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By proliferation efforts you mean what these countries are doing or not doing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What these countries we hope can and will do to ensure that vulnerable material -- they make every effort to lock down the type of vulnerable material that the President sees as such a danger.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President on this trip express support for goals which go beyond the goals of the START treaty he\xe2\x80\x99s about to sign -- for further reduction and nuclear capability?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are returning, Bill, to the city that the President laid out a vision, shared by the four men that are coming for the documentary tonight, to see a world without nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 The President I think rightly said that that\'s not likely a goal that he will live to see.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the trajectory and the path that he believes that we can and should be on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt that he will express that while this is an important step, it should be the first step in our efforts to reduce the risk between two countries like the United States and Russia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his argument to Republican senators, who have to ratify this if it\xe2\x80\x99s to become United States law?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he would certainly demonstrate that this is far and away in our best interest to reduce the threat that so many of these weapons have.</p>\n<p>I would point out, Bill, that this is -- Secretary Clinton brought this up when we did our briefing in here a few Fridays ago -- and I can get the statistics at the end of this; I think they\xe2\x80\x99re on my desk -- that on the last three big treaties, arms control treaties, the votes were in the mid-90s for all three of those treaties.\xc2\xa0 This has always been -- and the President believes always should be -- a bipartisan issue.\xc2\xa0 The President came to this issue through a friendship with Senator Lugar of Indiana.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Nunn, Perry, Shultz, Kissinger, two each from each party -- I think the President hopes that Democrats and Republicans can work together to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and ratify this treaty this year with the type of majorities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen done so in the past.</p>\n<p>Samantha.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Karzai, are you considering canceling this May 12th meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We certainly would evaluate whatever continued or further remarks President Karzai makes as to whether that\xe2\x80\x99s constructive to have such a meeting, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sort of, three strikes you\xe2\x80\x99re out?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the form that one fills out to cancel the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what are the consequences for those remarks?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty defiant.\xc2\xa0 He kind of doubled down on those remarks after a call from Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to why he said those things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asking if there are consequences from --**</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re troubling, they\xe2\x80\x99re confusing; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been investigated and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been found to be untruthful.\xc2\xa0 So whether there\xe2\x80\x99s some domestic political benefit that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to gain, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.</p>\n<p>We are in Afghanistan, and our young men and women are in Afghanistan because of the threat that al Qaeda and its extremist allies pose, and posed on September 11th when attacks planned in that area came to New York and just outside of Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 So we are there to -- for the safety and security of our country. And we understand, and we think that President Karzai needs to understand, that the safety and security of his country is not going to be gained simply by rooting out or moving extremist threats in certain areas that isn\xe2\x80\x99t ultimately then filled with good governance.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear with President Karzai, going back to last fall, and in numerous meetings and videoconferences since.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I do a quick follow of that?\xc2\xa0 Is Karzai our ally?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Karzai is the democratically elected leader of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I asked.\xc2\xa0 Is he our ally?\xc2\xa0 Is he the ally of the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are times in which the actions that he takes are constructive to governance.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the remarks he\xe2\x80\x99s made -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that anybody in this country found them anything other than troubling.</p>\n<p>So our position on this, Jake, is that when the Afghan leaders take steps to improve governance and root out corruption, then the President will say kind words.\xc2\xa0 When leaders need to hear stern language from this administration about the consequences of not acting, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s follow, which is -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Little early for Wimbledon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter Galbraith was on MSNBC this morning saying that Karzai was mentally unstable and suggesting that he was on drugs. Following up on Jake, is he a credible partner to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, he is the democratically elected leader of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And as I just said to Jake, we will not hesitate to ensure that the remarkable investment that our men and women are making is met with the type of governance that has to in place in order to secure parts of a dangerous country.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to speak out again if need be.\xc2\xa0 And we want to see President Karzai fulfill the commitments that he enunciated both at his inaugural address and at a donors conference in London -- those commitments he made not just to his people but to the international community that have invested in ensuring the security of his country.</p>\n<p>Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about coal and nuclear. And by the way, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this poppy season in Afghanistan, parenthetically?\xc2\xa0 Anyway, on coal, does the President favor stronger penalties for coal companies that might have violated safety rules?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if there are safety violations, the President believes that those violations have to be met with the full force of the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the nuclear -- I know nuclear weapons, but why can\'t** you discuss nuclear power and nuclear waste?\xc2\xa0 Is that likely to come up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At the Nuclear Security Summit?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s something that they\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a lot of time on, no.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the United States receive a clarification of Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that you asked for last week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Secretary -- President Karzai called Secretary Clinton I believe on Friday, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did that clarify anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d refer you to the statement that PJ in the State Department on that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, PJ made it sound as though Karzai was stunned that his remarks caused a stir.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- (laughter) -- now you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to think for Karzai through PJ.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- (laughter) -- that seems out of body.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do you need a further clarification?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the remarks are troubling and untruthful.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know why somebody continues to\xc2\xa0 insinuate that there was some sort of foreign corruption when the very thing that he speaks of was looked into.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t begin to decide what reasoning he had for making those comments.\xc2\xa0 Again, our focus is on ensuring that he is continuing to take the necessary steps in governance and corruption.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And next week\xe2\x80\x99s bilaterals, are those here or at the Convention Center?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re at the Convention Center.\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty big press build-out over there.\xc2\xa0 And those will all -- at least the last time I checked, they were all over at the Convention Center.\xc2\xa0 I will double-check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Is he coming?\xc2\xa0 Will there be a bilateral there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Israel will be here; I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if he\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xc2\xa0 We will have at that point recently met with President Sarkozy, President Medvedev and Prime Minister Netanyahu, so we are not meeting separately with those three because we\xe2\x80\x99ve done so fairly recently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said today that Russia may exit the Arms Reduction Treaty if the U.S. increases missile defense.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, any country can leave any treaty at any time.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what he\xe2\x80\x99s threatening to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would simply say that, as I spoke of here when we announced a change in our missile defense capabilities to ensure that the threat -- the potential threat from Iran in protecting the security of both Europe and the United States -- that was our focus and that remains our focus on missile defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would point out that when we announced that, the Russians hailed that.\xc2\xa0 So our stance on missile defense hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, despite the fact that they are now -- seem to be looking at it through a different lens.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s also -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken -- talking about a missile defense capability, offensive in nature, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President bring it up in Prague when he goes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If President Medvedev -- if they discuss missile defense -- the President will simply reiterate what he and others have told anybody in the world that our posture on missile defense is to ensure the security of this country and our allies in Europe from a growing threat, and possible threat, from Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Prague schedule doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any Obama-Medvedev availability on it, press availability.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is -- there was I think a little confusion on the press schedule that went out.\xc2\xa0 There is a -- the signing, the statements, and the Q&amp;A, it\xe2\x80\x99s all blocked off as the signing.\xc2\xa0 So our apologies if that confused --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The usual number of questions per side?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A half each, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I always love these things.\xc2\xa0 We go to these things, and we\xe2\x80\x99re like one question apiece.\xc2\xa0 And then whoever gets called on asks four questions and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do you blame us?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s always curious to know that when you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked four questions and then you say, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we only got one question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know what that feels like.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I would not, in your case, be thinking of a question for Prague.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will come back to me.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about an issue brought up by the group called the September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows. Apparently, they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent a video letter to the President expressing concerns about the trial of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad.\xc2\xa0 They support the decision to go with a civilian trial.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re expressing concern now that there are discussions and negotiations of a compromise with folks like Senator Lindsey Graham for getting KSM to a military tribunal.\xc2\xa0 They say to do so would amount to the President buckling under political pressure. First, is there anything new on that front with discussions about the trial?\xc2\xa0 And, second, how do you respond to their --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do not know whether the letter has -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know in what part of transit that\xe2\x80\x99s in.\xc2\xa0 I would say this, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new that I know of.\xc2\xa0 I still think we\xe2\x80\x99re a few weeks away from a decision.\xc2\xa0 I would say that we are looking at many possibilities based on the fact that Congress became heavily involved in the potential choosing of venues for such a trial.\xc2\xa0 And we understand the security and logistical concerns that a city like New York has.\xc2\xa0 So, given those concerns and given congressional prerogatives, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at all available alternatives.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 On the ratification in the Senate, do you all have any early indication of whether any of the Republicans in the Senate do plan on blocking it or trying to block it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you have any sort of early read since you announced it on any stumbling blocks?\xc2\xa0 You talked about the ones that are supportive, but you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with NSC and see whether they have heard -- I think when people get an opportunity to look at the text of the treaty, which will happen in short order, they\xe2\x80\x99ll see, as I said earlier, that this is strongly in our national interest.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this prejudges his decision, but the statement that Senator Lugar put out around the time of our announcement I think many believed was encouraging in his desire to see swift ratification.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99d just mention, as I said to Bill, this is normally an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to put aside what normally happens in Washington and come together to ratify something that we have seen Democratic and Republican Presidents do for many years.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that that happens again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just on the meeting this morning with the African American religious leaders, can you describe how that meeting went and what they talked about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not have a readout from that, but let me try to get something for you guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Does the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You were acting all aggrieved a minute ago, Lester, like somehow you only -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Does the President\xe2\x80\x99s apology to Doris in North Carolina for his 17-minute answer to her one question mean that in future White House press conferences he will also be brief in response so as to allow more than 13 questioners, presuming he ever has any more press conferences?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Was that one or four?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was just one?\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s another?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other.\xc2\xa0 Just one other.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward with great anticipation to that.</p>\n<p>Lester, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m largely the one who coined the phrase that it used to take the President several minutes to clear his throat giving answers, so -- I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s not watching.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, there are complex issues in our times that this President and this Congress have to deal with.\xc2\xa0 Not all of it can be done in neatly phrased eight-second sound bites.\xc2\xa0 When talking about something the size and the scope of health care reform it takes a while to sketch out the landscape and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President enjoys doing, either in an interview setting or in a town hall meeting where citizens get to ask those questions directly of the President.</p>\n<p>I was going to give another 16 minutes on that answer, but I decided -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, keep it short.\xc2\xa0 Is the President grateful for the statement, \xe2\x80\x9cWe consider health reform to have been an important battle and a success of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s government,\xe2\x80\x9d as made by Fidel Castro?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that statement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he made it and it\xe2\x80\x99s there.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He probably e-mailed you directly, Lester.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President likes this statement, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Did the President like it or not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am unaware that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the statement.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll come back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, you funny man.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to keep myself entertained, Lester.\xc2\xa0 So please tip your waitresses.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be here all week.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, there\xe2\x80\x99s a psychological statement saying, we cannot change anything unless we accept it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you tried to change your situation towards Iran -- to accept nuclear Iran?\xc2\xa0 And dealing with nuclear Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has -- the President, in an interview yesterday, said he understands and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the right of countries to peacefully pursue nuclear power.\xc2\xa0 But Iran has obligations as part of the NPT that it must live up to. Over the past many years, it has taken some very provocative steps in direct avoidance of those obligations.\xc2\xa0 The President outlined with President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Brown at the G20 an effort by the Iranians to go around the IAEA in a clandestine effort that many presumed was to create nuclear material for a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is -- that breaks their obligation and their commitment to the international community.</p>\n<p>So I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past more than a year are efforts at engagement that Iran has decided on each and every -- at each and every turn to step back from.\xc2\xa0 That has brought the international community along to the point where our partners in the P5-plus-1 will soon, as the President and others have acknowledged, take strong sanctions into the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And the President hopes to see the sanctions pass the Security Council by spring.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But regarding meeting with President of Armenia and President of United States, any meeting with the Prime Minister of Turkey?\xc2\xa0 The three of them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No meeting.\xc2\xa0 Obviously on any number of occasions, offers have been given to accept the help of the international community if it lives up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 And each and every time, when faced with either living up to those obligations or walking away from them, the government of Iran has every single time walked away from them.</p>\n<p>Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, thanks.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as President decision last week to sign 123 U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement, Indians are celebrating in India, and also across the street at U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S.-India Business Council, 500 Fortune companies, are applauding President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 Are you making any kind of -- having any kind of ceremony when Prime Minister of India visits next week here on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific event around that issue.\xc2\xa0 As we talked about last week, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President -- President Bush and President Obama both supported.\xc2\xa0 I assume it will come up in their bilateral meeting next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as far as this U.S.-Russia nuclear agreement and also this posture is concerned, many think tanks are saying that although U.S. and Russia will reduce, but China is rising and building up all the nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons and spreading.\xc2\xa0 So what -- where do we stand as far as China is concerned in the future?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously proliferation and many other topics the President -- President Obama and President Hu will get an opportunity to discuss next week.</p>\n<p>Obviously we had an expired START agreement with Russia that needed to be renewed, needed to see deeper cuts in each side\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes it was an enormously -- it is an enormously important step, as I said earlier, on the road to reducing the nuclear threat in our world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a number of cases sort of wending their way through the courts right now challenging DOMA and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Last week the Department of Justice filed another brief defending \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It angered a lot of advocates; some legal scholars thought it was a step backwards in terms of dismantling the law.\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all concerned that DOJ is a little insular or tone deaf on issues that are sort of politically sticky, especially those of interest to the L/G community?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, obviously the President has enunciated his support for ending \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d rolling back -- made a commitment to roll back DOMA in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Justice Department has -- is charged with upholding the law as it exists, not as the President would like to see it.\xc2\xa0 We have obviously taken steps on the front of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a genuine amount of progress.\xc2\xa0 I will say, was it odd that they included previous statements from General Colin Powell on a belief set that he no longer had?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President would disagree with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him talk about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To get back to what Secretary Gates may have said a couple of years ago regarding nuclear use posturing, it\xe2\x80\x99s always been sort of ambiguous by design in the past.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work or really needed changing significantly?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this, we have -- as I said earlier, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s new posture review is predicated on the logic of incentivizing good behavior, of ensuring the security of those that live up to their obligations, and provides no assurance to those that either have a nuclear weapon or in the case of Iran and North Korea aren\xe2\x80\x99t living up to its obligations.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered -- we\xe2\x80\x99re entering into a different period with relative stability and peace among larger countries in the world.\xc2\xa0 This is a posture review obviously designed to drill down a bit on places like North Korea and Iran, and to demonstrate to countries around the world, as I said earlier, if you live up to those obligations, you will enjoy the benefits of being an active, responsible member of the international community.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a couple things on the NPR.\xc2\xa0 Is it true that the administration was considering a blanket \xe2\x80\x9cno first use\xe2\x80\x9d policy as recently as a few weeks ago?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with those -- I was not in the 150 or so meetings that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m told that during the campaign, the then-candidate Obama talked about de-alerting the nuclear force.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why did he --**</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, we obviously have bombers that are no longer on alert.\xc2\xa0 We have ICBMs and sea-based missiles that do remain on alert status.\xc2\xa0 Our forces are configured in such a way that a retaliatory strike does not need to be launched at the first detection of a foreign launch.\xc2\xa0 The Nuclear Posture Review proposes that we consider a series of options that extend presidential decision-making time, by strengthening command and control apparatus around those nuclear weapons, and that we open discussions with Russia to reduce the possibility of either an accidental launch or a false detection of a launch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you consider this a version of a de-alert?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President believes that this gives -- extending that decision-making times gives a President the ability to ensure that that decision is -- whatever decision he makes is one that\xe2\x80\x99s based on the best available information for the longest period of time.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been several very serious bomb attacks in Baghdad over the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 How serious -- closely is the White House following this situation?\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that the continued political vacuum following the elections could offer a window for insurgents?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think many expected that insurgents would use this time to roll back the progress, both militarily and politically, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The leadership and team here have spoken with our ambassador and with General Odierno.\xc2\xa0 He believes that this does not threaten our ability to draw down our forces later in the year.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we are very focused on, and Vice President Biden is very focused on, the steps that need to be taken to ensure political advancement in Iraq after these elections.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just back on China really quick.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a little more detail on what the President is expecting out of this meeting with President Hu next week?\xc2\xa0 NPR mentioned several times the need for transparency with their nuclear arsenal.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything tangible that\'s expected to come --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think obviously proliferation will be a big part of that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously whenever we get together with China, discussions about energy will be on the table, discussions about the global economic recovery, and certainly discussions about what the President has talked about in terms of a market-based currency will be on there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll have something, again, more detailed at the conclusion of it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and I think right now it\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, Monday morning.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on two things.\xc2\xa0 On Karzai and his statements, what kind of credibility concerns are there when it comes to Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to find Osama bin Laden?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t want to get into, from up here, the efforts that are ongoing to specifically root out and identify and capture terrorists.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President step up the pacing in this region of the world, in both Afghanistan and in the surrounding countries, to the point that has degraded the capabilities of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And I would just leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has he caused any kind of concerns in this administration about his credibility?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that there are credibility issues with him after these statements about voting in his country?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 About what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The voting statements in his country.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that we have -- we found the remarks to be -- continue to be troubling.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think people that read the remarks here don\xe2\x80\x99t understand based on, as I said earlier, based on the notion that what he alleges has fully been investigated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I understand you about the remarks, but does it lend you to feel like, okay, it might permeate into other areas, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about this one area?\xc2\xa0 Are there concerns about other areas --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have and the President has been concerned about governance and corruption in Afghanistan before the election, during the time period in which the election was in flux, and on the phone call congratulating President Karzai on his reelection.\xc2\xa0 So obviously the team spent an enormous amount of time discussing governance and corruption during the Afghanistan-Pakistan review that took place over the fall, over many, many hours.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, the black ministers meeting.\xc2\xa0 Why was it important to have today and why did it even happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout on the meeting.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President wanted to, as we celebrate Easter, have folks here at the White House to share in what is a very important holiday for many.\xc2\xa0 And I will try to get a readout of some more specifics --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not necessarily the readout, but they were a subset before the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\'m talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to know why.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President just wanted an opportunity to talk to them about the work that the administration is continuing to do.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Census, Erick Erickson, a commentator for CNN, a couple of days ago, he said he was not going to fill out his Census form, and if a Census worker came to the door, he said he would \xe2\x80\x9cpull out my wife\xe2\x80\x99s shotgun and see how that little twerp likes being scared at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So my question is, do those remarks concern the White House?\xc2\xa0 And are there any --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It should concern CNN -- probably first and foremost.\xc2\xa0 Probably concerns his wife as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts about protection for Census workers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a lot of people that get on cable TV and say stuff so that people will quote it back to other people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously the Census determines the representation you have in what we call representative democracy.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s why somebody like Karl Rove, who obviously I and others in this administration have disagreed with for going on many years, understands that the lunacy of ripping up your Census form or not sending it in or, God forbid, the remarkably crazy remarks of somebody that would threaten somebody simply trying to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re adequately represented in this country.\xc2\xa0 These days it never ceases to amaze you -- and usually it\xe2\x80\x99s only trumped by what somebody will knowingly say tomorrow about -- I think it was Lincoln who said, \xe2\x80\x9cBetter to be thought a fool than to open one\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and remove all doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think that would be my advice.</p>\n<p>Glenn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thanks for giving me a chance to validate Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s quote.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is Lincoln, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some remarkably disturbing footage out today of a U.S. helicopter engaging with some folks in Baghdad in 2007; 12 fatalities.\xc2\xa0 In this video the pilots can be heard remarking when an individual flees holding a baby in his arms, that it was the fault of those individuals for bringing the children into combat. Has the President seen that?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that that sort of activity on its face appears to have been appropriate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Glenn, I do not know whether the President has seen the video that was released on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Obviously it is very graphic in nature and it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely tragic.\xc2\xa0 For details of the investigation that the Defense Department and the Pentagon did on that, around that incident, obviously I would point you over to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Many of you all have traveled with the President -- this President or other Presidents -- in war zones.\xc2\xa0 Many of you know colleagues that have reported from exceedingly dangerous places in the world.\xc2\xa0 Our military will take every precaution necessary to ensure the safety and security of civilians, and particularly those that report in those dangerous places on behalf of news organizations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this warrants some additional investigation, though?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Glenn, I don\xe2\x80\x99t in all honesty know enough about what was done previously, which is why I would point you over to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any statement on the decision that just came down this morning on net neutrality?\xc2\xa0 And also -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you two now.\xc2\xa0 Related to that there are two vacancies on the D.C. Circuit Court that the President has yet to put nominations for. Why the delay?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on the circuit court.\xc2\xa0 I have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the administration -- I don\'t think the White House has had an opportunity to fully evaluate the court case representing a -- [cell phone rings] -- double pepperoni available at the gate?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, I will -- yes, extra cheese, onions ready to be picked up.</p>\n<p>I will check on the D.C. court.\xc2\xa0 We have not had an opportunity to fully evaluate the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision -- the decision affecting the FCC, which as you know is an independent agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the administration broadly support the notion of net neutrality, though?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It does, it does, it does.\xc2\xa0 And the President discussed that obviously in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to that and committed to providing businesses with the certainty that they need, as well.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for letting so many people ask questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that pat on the head, Lester.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:07 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
