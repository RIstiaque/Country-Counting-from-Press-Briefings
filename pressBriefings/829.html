EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Good day -- it\'s 12 o\'clock noon.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us as we make our way south to the great state of Florida.\xc2\xa0 I think you know what the President is doing there today, so no need to go over the schedule.</p>\n<p>I just want to note that there was -- Senator McCain gave an important interview the other day, and I think it\'s an indication that there\'s still a possibility of bipartisanship, bipartisan cooperation and agreement, because Senator McCain pointedly complained about the fact that at Nationals Stadium, Teddy Roosevelt -- the mascot for Teddy Roosevelt has yet to ever win the race among the presidents.\xc2\xa0 This is an outrage.\xc2\xa0 I agree with Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 I\'m comfortable saying that my boss agrees with Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 After all, it was President Obama who gave the speech I\'m sure you all remember in Osawatomie, Kansas last year -- a place and a speech that is very resonant in the history of President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>\n<p>With that, we\'ll take your questions -- unless you have a topper.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to -- since we\'re on our way to the Univision town hall the President will be doing -- to take a moment just to talk about Mitt Romney\'s performance last evening. He spent 35 minutes, as I understand it, with the hosts at Univision.\xc2\xa0 During that time he reminded not only the Latino community, millions of people across the country, but the middle-class families on why they can\'t trust him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Just a few highlights.\xc2\xa0 Last night he said again he\'d veto the DREAM Act.\xc2\xa0 He criticized the Obama administration\'s deferred action of policy, refusing to again answer the question -- I think it\'s been at least half a dozen times he\'s been asked by multiple networks -- whether he would continue the executive order -- refused to answer that, leaving millions of young people uncertain for months to come.\xc2\xa0 He doubled down on self-deportation, saying he wanted a long-term solution but refusing to propose his own plan there, and also refusing to include the context of why people would self-deport, because his plan would make it so terrible for Latinos and immigrants across the country.</p>\n<p>And finally, he also said he was happy to be the grandfather of the health care plan, which is interesting given that he continues to say he would veto it on his first day in office, leaving 9 million Latinos without health care.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not sure how that squares, but just wanted to highlight that for all of you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this venue today, the thrust of Mitt Romney\'s argument is that the President\'s policies -- his economic policies have not helped Latino voters during the last four years.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the President\'s response to that?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of issues that Latino voters care about.\xc2\xa0 Of course, there is immigration policy, and if we start just with that, Mitt Romney has the most extreme position of any candidate in modern history running for President on that issue.\xc2\xa0 He has endorsed the policy of self-deportation.\xc2\xa0 He has said the Arizona law should be a model for the country.\xc2\xa0 He has said he would veto the DREAM Act.</p>\n<p>So that alone is not a winning package of policies for Latino families.\xc2\xa0 But if you take it to more broad issues, including health care, there are 9 million Latinos in this country who have health care because of the Affordable Health Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney wants to veto that his first day in office.\xc2\xa0 That\'s bad news for Latino families.</p>\n<p>His budget that he supports would cut education by 20 percent.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue Latinos care deeply about in this country.\xc2\xa0 He has said his policy on middle-class tax cuts -- this is an issue that would impact, again, millions of families.</p>\n<p>We\'re happy to line up any day of the week the President\'s policies, the President\'s vision on these issues and how they would impact not just middle-class families but Latino families. And I expect you\'ll hear the President talk about that today.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add a couple of things -- that thanks to the President\'s policies, middle-class Americans have, on average, seen their taxes go down $3,600 since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 And that includes obviously Hispanic Americans -- middle-class Hispanic Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President has administratively taken action to allow millions of Americans to take advantage of historically low interest rates.\xc2\xa0 Latino American homeowners have been able to take advantage of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is pressing Congress to take action to allow millions more Americans to take advantage of these historically low interest rates, to refinance and lower their mortgage payments, which would be a boon to Latinos.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, one element of the American Jobs Act, which Republicans have adamantly refused to pass and allow to become law, was investments in infrastructure that would put construction workers back on the job.\xc2\xa0 And as all of you know, the construction industry has a heavy Latino American representation in it.\xc2\xa0 And if Republicans would, with Mitt Romney\'s support, stop blocking passage of that provision of the American Jobs Act we\'d see many more construction workers back on the job, rebuilding the infrastructure of this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Inspector General report is due out on the Colombia prostitution scandal.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any comment and the fact that FOX News is reporting two White House advance team members will be implicated in that report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me tell you this.\xc2\xa0 There is an Inspector General report that is not out, we do not have, and none of the people in that anonymously sourced story have seen, by their own admission.\xc2\xa0 So I have no comment, again, on an IG report that nobody has seen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House has not seen this report at this time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me repeat -- nobody has seen -- we have not seen, FOX News\xe2\x80\x99s sources have not seen, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll await the report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 FOX is going to take that?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to defend your own reporting?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the White House, though, stand by the White House Counsel report from last spring that no White House personnel were involved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, as I said at the time, the White House Counsel reviewed and found no evidence of White House staff involvement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with President Karzai, whether you can give us any more of a sense of whether the President and Mr. Karzai made progress on the green-on-blue violence issue, or any other of the topics that have been kind of a source of some tension in recent months?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President held a videoconference with President Karzai as part of their regular consultations and following up on their phone call of last week. The two Presidents discussed a range of issues, including efforts to stem insider attacks on U.S. coalition and Afghan forces, the so-called green-on-blue attacks.\xc2\xa0 They also discussed the importance of continuing to encourage restraint and non-violence in reaction to inflammatory materials, and continued implementation of the U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership Agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President expressed his condolences and remembrances on the eve of the one-year anniversary of former Afghan President Rabbani\xe2\x80\x99s assassination.\xc2\xa0 And the two leaders agreed to continue our work together in support of an Afghan-led reconciliation process.</p>\n<p>The President reiterated his strong support for Afghan sovereignty, and the two leaders agreed to take additional concrete steps to implement the Strategic Partnership Agreement, including launching the U.S.-Afghan bilateral commission in coming weeks, and beginning negotiations on a bilateral security agreement.</p>\n<p>In terms of the green-on-blue attacks, as I said yesterday, this is obviously a matter of concern, and that concern has led to ISAF issuing a directive to heighten protection for -- and take measures to protect our troops on the ground in Afghanistan. And that has led General Allen to make changes in our partnering operation, changes that will enhance security for our forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we had some positive news in the housing market yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Does the President get a sense that the housing situation is rebounding?\xc2\xa0 Is he optimistic?\xc2\xa0 Just give a sense of where he is.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Hans, the housing market was hit extremely hard by the collapse and the Great Recession, and it has proven to be a very challenging problem, one that the President has addressed with numerous initiatives.\xc2\xa0 Any piece of data that indicates improvement in the housing market is welcome.</p>\n<p>But our reaction to individual pieces of data is always fairly muted because we look at trends and we look at what works still needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, there are measures that would become law if only Republicans would support them that would assist millions of now homeowners in refinancing their homes and being able to take advantage of historically low mortgage rates.\xc2\xa0 And that would also help improve the housing market, the President believes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we welcome positive signs, but we know there is much work to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to get anything from the President on housing today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview for you of his remarks or answers to questions that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he might get.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask it differently.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to get anything from the President on piracy today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have no preview of his remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple things on Libya, a follow.\xc2\xa0 FOX has some intelligence sources saying that al Qaeda was involved in this attack and possibly a former Guantanamo detainee.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have a reaction, comment on that.\xc2\xa0 And then second, there was a counterterrorism official on the Hill yesterday calling it a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 Any further administration clarification on what you\xe2\x80\x99re classifying the attack?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- hold on one second, let me find this here.\xc2\xa0 I think the sources that you cite I think include the open hearing with the NCTC Director, Mr. Olsen, in which he discussed indications of possible involvement of elements of extremist groups, including possible participation by elements of al Qaeda and particularly al Qaeda in the Maghreb, an al Qaeda affiliate.</p>\n<p>It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials.\xc2\xa0 So, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s self-evident.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to a couple of things that Mr. Olsen said, which is that at this point it appears that a number of different elements were involved in the attack, including individuals connected to militant groups that are prevalent in Eastern Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He also made clear that at this point, based on the information he has -- and he is briefing the Hill on the most up-to-date intelligence -- we have no information at this point that suggests that this was a significantly preplanned attack, but this was the result of opportunism, taking advantage of and exploiting what was happening as a result of reaction to the video that was found to be offensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify, does the President see that it was an attack on 9/11, a terrorist attack on 9/11?\xc2\xa0 Is that the administration or the President\'s view?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The attack occurred on September 11, 2012.\xc2\xa0 So we use the same calendar at the White House that you do, and, yes, he sees it.\xc2\xa0 I will simply point you to the testimony of Mr. Olsen, in which he said, based on the information that they have now -- and this is an ongoing investigation -- their judgment is that it was an opportunistic attack in which elements including, possibly, elements of al Qaeda in the Maghreb, participated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to something you said, the self-evident part of that.\xc2\xa0 Just help me understand that.\xc2\xa0 It was a self-evident terrorist attack because acts of terror were committed?\xc2\xa0 Or it was self-evident because you\'ve -- because it actually happened on 9/11?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I meant it was self -- that had this happened on any day of the week in any month, this would have been a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 This was an assault on our embassy, a violent attack on our -- I mean, rather our diplomatic facility there that resulted in the deaths of four Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s the definition --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s on the President\'s schedule for the U.N. meetings next week?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any bilats scheduled with any world leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no bilats scheduled, as we\'ve said all along.\xc2\xa0 He will obviously be making remarks.\xc2\xa0 And I have no more than that to provide to you at this time, but there are no bilats scheduled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s scheduled to do an interview with The View while he\'s up in New York.\xc2\xa0 I mean, how should people look at that?\xc2\xa0 He has time to do an interview like that, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to meet with world leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think his engagement with foreign leaders has been, and will continue to be, extremely robust.\xc2\xa0 We just simply have no formal bilateral meetings scheduled at this time.\xc2\xa0 If the schedule changes, I will be happy to update you.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, his attendance at UNGA is in keeping with attendance by past Presidents engaged in a reelection campaign and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be there overnight in New York.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he not have time for foreign engagements for leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m simply saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any schedule updates for you at this time.\xc2\xa0 We have no bilateral meetings to announce.\xc2\xa0 There are none on his schedule at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President on Letterman the other night and then Joe Biden in Iowa this week really sort of soft-pedaled their discussions of the Mitt Romney video where he talked about the 47 percent of Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t pay income taxes.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect to hear sort of a tougher line on that from the President either today or going forward?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, what you heard the President say is absolutely what he believes, which is that when you\'re elected President, when you\'re running for President, you represent 100 percent of people in this country, and that the question that we should all raise about that video is, who is Mitt Romney talking about?\xc2\xa0 Was he talking about military veterans returning from serving overseas who are receiving benefits?\xc2\xa0 Is he talking about seniors who have worked 50 years and getting Social Security?\xc2\xa0 Is he talking about students who work two jobs and have student aid?</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely what he believes, is -- well, what his response was, was just that it was disbelief that Mitt Romney was ruling out 50 percent of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There were clearly many pieces of that video that you all have reported on and talked about in the past couple of days.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview what the President will talk about.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\'ve said we\'re looking at this for other forms of paid media.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any preview for that either.</p>\n<p>But if you look even at the foreign policy pieces of that, in just the last few weeks alone, every time Mitt Romney has dipped his toe into the foreign policy pool, he has raised questions not only among Democrats but among Republicans and people in his own party about whether he\'s prepared to be Commander-In-Chief.\xc2\xa0 He offended one of our closest allies -- I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s more than a few weeks ago -- when he went to London. He failed to mention troops in his speech that he gave at the convention.\xc2\xa0 He stepped over the line in criticizing, accusing the President of sympathizing with the attackers in Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, this week we\'ve seen further evidence that he says something different in public and private.\xc2\xa0 And I think that just continues to feed into a narrative and raise questions about whether he\'s prepared on that level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President said on Tuesday that there would be plenty of time to discuss the video.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that there are other plans --</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 -- with us for another 47 days here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there specific plans as far as how to -- what to do with it as this point, or how --</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview our strategy.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the large question this raises is why is Mitt Romney ruling out 50 percent of the country?\xc2\xa0 Who are these people he\'s talking about?\xc2\xa0 And the Commander-In-Chief question I mentioned. We have a lot of time to go.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot of discussions, debates, paid media that will be had.\xc2\xa0 And stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, there was a flap last week over the President not meeting in person with Netanyahu in the upcoming UNGA.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that, given Netanyahu\'s relationship with Mitt Romney, that the Prime Minister may have taken sides in this election?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I watched the Sunday shows last weekend, as many of you may have as well, and what the Prime Minister made clear during that interview was both that his schedule, as we said, didn\xe2\x80\x99t match up with the President\'s schedule, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet; and second, that he had no desire to get involved or engaged in presidential politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President enjoys strong support from the Jewish community in this country because they know he has been a steadfast friend of the Jewish state, and he has provided unprecedented security cooperation and assistance to Israel, and he has stood squarely with Israel on the world stage.\xc2\xa0 And that was a lot of what you heard Prime Minister Netanyahu say on Sunday as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there are a number -- just to take this to the political side -- there are a number of issues beyond that specific issue that Jewish voters in this country care about -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s access to affordable health care, making sure middle-class taxes are extended.\xc2\xa0 And these are the issues that the President will continue to talk about as well as his steadfast support for Israel.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just add, if you look at what Prime Minister Netanyahu said on Sunday, he made clear that he believes that the President is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And this is obviously a top issue both for the Israelis and for the United States.</p>\n<p>And he and Defense Minister Barak have made clear in the past that the level of cooperation and support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security that this administration has provided is unprecedented in the U.S.-Israel relationship.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part -- because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, and it will continue.</p>\n<p>I would also note that the President spent an hour on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu last week and that it is a simple fact that he has spent more time in person and on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu than any other foreign leader since he took office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President met with Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any plans to visit Burma when he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the region for the Southeast Asian nation summit in November?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no foreign travel updates for you today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aung San Suu Kyi has called a couple of times this week for an easing of -- further easing of U.S. sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, did that come up in the meeting he had and if so, did he indicate a willingness to move in that direction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there were -- it was a broad conversation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific items that were discussed.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is we are working with the government of Burma very effectively on a process that -- whereby reforms undertaken by the government of Burma are met with actions taken by the United States in terms of easing sanctions and other measures.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues, as Secretary Clinton has discussed.\xc2\xa0 But we are actively engaged with President Thein Sein on this issue and his government, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be engaged in that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you -- have you called it a terrorist attack before?\xc2\xa0 Have you said that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, but -- I mean, people attacked our embassy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an act of terror by definition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do with what date it occurred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I just hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard the White House say that this was an act of terrorism or a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 And I just --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the fact that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t is not -- as our NCTC Director testified yesterday, a number of different elements appear to have been involved in the attack, including individuals connected to militant groups that are prevalent in eastern Libya, particularly in the Benghazi area.\xc2\xa0 We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al Qaeda or al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s affiliates, in particular al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.</p>\n<p>He also pointed out that -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out as well -- that the FBI investigation into this tragedy is ongoing, but according to the best information we have now, we believe it was an opportunistic attack on our mission in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 It appears that some well-armed militants seized on the opportunity as the events unfolded that evening.\xc2\xa0 We do not have any specific intelligence that there was significant advanced planning or coordination for this attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, that is the best information we have right now.\xc2\xa0 There is an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 As more information becomes available, we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate it -- our experts will evaluate it and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll brief the Hill and make people aware of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, I just -- I just wanted to clarify.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No worries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President aspire to be in the President\xe2\x80\x99s race some day?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let history decide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pandering to Teddy Roosevelt.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:25 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
