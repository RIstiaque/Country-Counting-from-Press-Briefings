Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p align="center">\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for an answer to a question (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t*The President was briefed on Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari earlier this month and yesterday he was informed that an arrest was likely.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:18 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late.\xc2\xa0 I apologize.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New regime.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a new leaf.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What, the apology?\xc2\xa0 Gibbs never apologized.\xc2\xa0 I take it back.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There you go.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, I have a couple of details about recent conversations that President Obama has had with foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 First, since the readout was sent last night fairly late, I just want to make sure that all of you know that last night around 8:00 p.m. Eastern, the President spoke with Mexico President Calder\xcf\x8cn.\xc2\xa0 President Obama expressed appreciation for the strong investigative work of the Mexicans to arrest one of Special Agent Zapata\xe2\x80\x99s alleged killers.\xc2\xa0 And President Calder\xcf\x8cn expressed appreciation for the cooperation of American agencies that made the arrest possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that neither the United States nor Mexico could tolerate violence against those who serve and protect our citizens, as Special Agent Zapata did so selflessly through his own life.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama also said he was looking forward to welcoming President Calder\xcf\x8cn to the White House on Thursday, March 3rd, to discuss our important bilateral relationship and key global issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to mention that this afternoon the President is scheduled to speak with Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy to coordinate our actions in response to the situation in Libya.\xc2\xa0 We expect additional conversations with foreign leaders on this topic in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I am ready for your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the Americans that are in this situation with the ferry that\xe2\x80\x99s not able to leave Tripoli?\xc2\xa0 Are there contingency plans to get them out?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The State Department, the government is working very hard to evacuate the Americans from Libya.\xc2\xa0 The details of those operations are available at the State Department, but we are doing everything we can to safely evacuate them from Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that evacuation still not having happened, how does that complicate the U.S. response to the situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think you heard the President say yesterday very clearly what our -- what his position is towards the situation, towards the actions of the Libyan government, very clear condemnation of the violence against the protesters there, violence against Libyan citizens, he also is obviously very concerned about the safety of Americans, and that is a priority.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any movement on sanctions, no-fly zone?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously sanctions are something we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into specifics.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with the international community, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping and believe that the international community will speak with one voice, as I think is often the case.\xc2\xa0 When the international community comes together and speaks with one voice it has a powerful impact in terms of persuading a government like Libya\xe2\x80\x99s to do the right thing, to stop the kind of violence it\xe2\x80\x99s been perpetrating on its own people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re examining a lot of options -- sanctions are one of them, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to specify that one is going to happen and one\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will sanctions be on the agenda when the President speaks to Cameron and Sarkozy today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they will be discussing Libya.\xc2\xa0 And I think that they will be discussing different options that we can take -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, other countries, international partners -- to affect the behavior of the Libyan government.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, broadly speaking, our options will be discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of military options are being considered?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that there are no options we\xe2\x80\x99re taking off the table.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on are the options that we can take to affect the situation in the nearer term.\xc2\xa0 And we would like to see the kind of concerted, broad-based international action that can compel the Libyan government to cease and desist from the kind of actions it\xe2\x80\x99s taking against its own people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as keeping U.S. citizens safe in Libya, who is the -- who are you guys talking to within the Libyan government?\xc2\xa0 I mean, while we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the ferry to go since the weather is not supposed to change for at least the next few days.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the security of these American citizens is an extremely high priority, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything from this podium or publicly that would affect their security.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into what specifically we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re safe.\xc2\xa0 We are taking -- doing everything we can to evacuate them, to make sure they are safe.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into how we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Colonel Qaddafi today in a rambling phone interview with Libyan state television, as well as two days ago, talked about how the protesters had been fed hallucinogens by Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the administration had any response to anything Mr. Qaddafi has said in the last couple days.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve approached this, the way the President has approached this, is that our position on the unrest in these countries is not about an individual leader.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the responsibility that each government has to not respond with violence to peaceful demonstrators, to not restrict the universal rights that their citizens have, and to move forward with the kind of reforms that will be responsive to the legitimate aspirations of their people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about personalities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would simply note that one consistent theme I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the way that we have responded to these developments, these events in the Middle East, in the region, has been to make it clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s also not about the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about the United States dictating outcomes, picking leaders, telling countries who can run, who can be their leader and who can\xe2\x80\x99t be -- because what we have seen are legitimate, organic, grassroots risings by the peoples of these countries demanding more freedom and greater opportunity in their lives.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about individual leaders and it\xe2\x80\x99s about the peoples in these countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The French Defense Minister has talked openly about imposing a no-fly zone more openly than the U.S. has talked about it.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to explain what other leaders in other countries have said or other senior officials from other countries.\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to specify which options are on or off the table.\xc2\xa0 We are discussing a full range of options with our partners at the U.N. and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And we expect to take action in the near term with the international community to, we believe, hopefully compel the Libyan government to stop killing its own people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any theory as to why other nations have been allowed by the Libyan government to land planes to extricate their citizens and the Libyan government has not allowed the United States to do so?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, for the details on our efforts to extract American citizens from -- or help evacuate American citizens from Libya I refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I just know that we are doing everything we can to make that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Back to the military options.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been presented yet with a military plan on Libya from the Pentagon?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific options that are under consideration or not under consideration.\xc2\xa0 I would again point out that we want to work with our international partners because we think the most effective action in many cases can be when the international community speaks with one voice and acts in a united way.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling out bilateral options, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that that is a focus right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out that there is a military option?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling anything out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you won\xe2\x80\x99t say if the President has been presented with a military option yet?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a list of priorities in terms of what options you would like to attack first?\xc2\xa0 This is -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s no-fly zone, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s military -- has the administration put together a list of options in priority?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked and it\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed, the possibility of different kinds of sanctions, different measures that can be taken.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously on the table.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to categorize which options might come in which order, but we are interested in acting quickly because we have a situation in Libya that demands quick action.\xc2\xa0 So we are interested in some of the actions that can be taken in the near term.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any frustration for the administration that this is a country that the U.S. has no real deep ties to, no real financial ties to, and so the options, what\xe2\x80\x99s available, what may have been available in Egypt or other places is not available in Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, each country that has been affected by this unrest is different.\xc2\xa0 Each country in the region is different.\xc2\xa0 Each country has different traditions, political systems and relationships with the United States and other countries around the region and the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the way we approach our policy positions and make our decisions based on -- in reaction to the events in these countries is obviously affected by those differences, while it\xe2\x80\x99s also guided by the principles that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that apply to -- that guide our approach to all these countries and the unrest in them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a long way of saying each country is different and we deal with them and their differences as necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You said that it\xe2\x80\x99s not about an individual leader and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that all along and it was said during the Egyptian situation also.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t reluctant or hesitant to use the name Mubarak when he spoke, but he seems reluctant to even mention the name Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 Why the difference?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read over -- read too much into that because the overlying principle here is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the individual leaders, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the United States deciding who should or should not lead a country -- that\xe2\x80\x99s for the people of the country to decide.\xc2\xa0 And that in many ways is what this unrest has been about, either specific leaders or regimes or the way that the governments have treated their peoples.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would point you, again, to the fact that the leader this country, Colonel Qaddafi, has tried to suggest that the United States was behind the uprisings of its own people or the demonstrations, the peaceful demonstrations, in its own country by its own -- by Libya\xe2\x80\x99s own people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not the case.\xc2\xa0 And I think Jake pointed out that now he\xe2\x80\x99s searching around for somebody else to blame.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur focus is on the principles we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlaid -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out on the need for these governments in the region and around the world to be responsive to the legitimate aspirations of their people, and first and foremost, not to use violence in response to peaceful demonstrations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on military options, I know you said you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take anything off the table.\xc2\xa0 But my guess is a lot of the American people would like one option taken off the table and that\xe2\x80\x99s sending significant numbers of U.S. troops into Libya.\xc2\xa0 Is that an option you can take off the table?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to my answer.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s productive for us as we\xe2\x80\x99re examining our options to take one option or the other off the table.\xc2\xa0 But I am focused on -- I mean, we are focused on working with our partners internationally to take steps that will persuade or compel the Libyan government to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then I guess the logic of that is if you won\xe2\x80\x99t take that off the table, then sending significant numbers of troops is on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just will say that I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking options off the table -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Wisconsin -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, on the Wisconsin situation, Congressman Ellison and others have called for the President to come out to Wisconsin and stand with the workers.\xc2\xa0 Is that under discussion?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, Chip.\xc2\xa0 I think what we have made pretty clear is that the President thinks and we think, he\xe2\x80\x99s stated this, that obviously a lot of states in the union are dealing with fiscal issues, big problems in their state budgets that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And they need to act responsibly, tighten their belts, live within their means, just as we in Washington, the executive branch and Congress need to do with our federal situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And forgive me --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But again, he believes very strongly that the way to achieve that, just like the way to achieve it here, is that people need to come to the table, work together, share the sacrifice, and produce the result that the people in the states want and, again, extrapolating to the larger picture here, the whole country -- do the things that we need to do to live within our means so that we can invest in the future, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true on a state level.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And forgive me if I\xe2\x80\x99m being redundant, I missed much of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about what he said about joining the picket lines back in 2007 when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf American workers are being denied their right to organize when I\xe2\x80\x99m in the White House, I will put on a comfortable pair of shoes and I will walk on that picket line with you as President of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is he ready to put on a comfortable pair of shoes and fulfill that promise?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Chip, that the President, as President, has a -- obviously an ability to be heard when he speaks, and he spoke to the situation in Wisconsin and his views on it last week.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you weren\xe2\x80\x99t with him at the time, but do you think he meant that when he said it?\xc2\xa0 Is that a promise?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t with him at the time, but again, I think that the President has different means of speaking out on issues and being heard, and clearly he did -- he made his viewpoints known on the situation in Wisconsin, the need for people to come together.\xc2\xa0 He takes very seriously the fiscal situation that the states find themselves in -- some of the states -- and understands it because he understands it at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 But he encourages the parties involved to come together and sacrifice together and reach a solution that serves the interests of all the people of the states, just like he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to do for the broader nation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The inspector general of the Home Affordable Modification Program says it\xe2\x80\x99s effectively failed.\xc2\xa0 Does the President disagree?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on a second.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I have anything on that for --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Spencer Bachus of Alabama.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- okay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether or not the President agrees with the IG\xe2\x80\x99s report, Spencer Bachus of Alabama plans hearings in the House next week, and he is going to try and cut funding for it.\xc2\xa0 Would you fight that attempt?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do in response to a possible action by a senator.\xc2\xa0 So if and when something happens we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a response.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Would you consider saving 600,000 or 700,000 mortgages when the goal was 4 million to be a success?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about the seriousness with which we have been trying to deal with stabilizing the housing market, helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that, as you state, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of homeowners are in their homes because of the program.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working to make sure that those responsible homeowners that can be helped are able to stay in their homes.\xc2\xa0 And it is important to remember that those homeowners have been helped by this program.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Wall Street Journal says you\xe2\x80\x99re working on a new program that would have the industry put up a pool of money to reduce the principals of loans that are underwater.\xc2\xa0 Comment?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on possible programs we may be working on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the Saudi national arrested last night in Texas, apparently trying to construct a bomb and targeting former President Bush?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say a few things about that.\xc2\xa0 The President was informed about the operation by John Brennan prior to the arrest.\xc2\xa0 This arrest -- I assume everybody here knows about this story -- the arrest once again underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad.\xc2\xa0 The President thanks the FBI, the Department of Justice and the rest of our law enforcement, intelligence and homeland security professionals who continue to keep us safe and who, once again, have served with extraordinary skill and with the commitment that their enormous responsibilities demand.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor anything else, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to refer you to the Department of Justice because obviously this arrest has been made and there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was told before the arrest?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he was aware of it before the arrest.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That the arrest was coming or that this was a lone-wolf terrorist out there that they were worried about?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was informed that the arrest was coming.*</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether the President has asked Secretary Gates to come up with a contingency plan to enforce a no-fly zone or start working with NATO on that respect?\xc2\xa0 There is some reports that that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place.\xc2\xa0 I understand you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t ruling any options out, but are plans being updated at least so that if the President gives an execute order this can happen fast?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that when we\xe2\x80\x99re examining all options, and that option has been tabled, I guess, at least in the press, but certainly been discussed in other venues; that by exploring those options we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the feasibility.\xc2\xa0 And I mean that broadly about all the options that are -- that could potentially be on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So without getting into updated plans for this option or that, exploring the options means just that:\xc2\xa0 examining what our options are and what might work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of consultation has there been with NATO?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I refer you to the Defense Department, but, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go down one lane here on one option and leave you with the impression that ---</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but has there been any consultation --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that I\xe2\x80\x99m ranking them.\xc2\xa0 Again, there have been -- we are examining all the options that are available to us, and conversations around that examination are obviously taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of sanctions, can you -- is there a concern that if you -- that some set of sanctions are going to harm the -- I guess the free part of Libya, the eastern -- where Qaddafi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have control?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there a way to do sanctions that can humanitarily help one part of the country while punishing the government itself?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we look at the options, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously examining the impact of different options.\xc2\xa0 And our interest is not in causing more harm to innocent people in Libya, the very people we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help, the international community is trying to help by getting -- doing what it can to get the Libyan government to stop its behavior.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that is a consideration about how you would execute different options in a way that have the greatest impact towards the goal we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve without negative consequences.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you raised the humanitarian aspect of this, the Libyan government has a responsibility not only to refrain from violence but to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those in need.\xc2\xa0 And as humanitarian assistance is attempted to be made available to Libyans, that\xe2\x80\x99s another responsibility that the Libyan government is going to be held accountable for.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the government -- does the administration view this as a full-fledged humanitarian crisis taking place right now in Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The administration views this as a serious issue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are working -- why Secretary Clinton is traveling to Geneva, why Bill Burns is traveling and engaging in these consultations, why the President is having phone calls with other leaders tonight on this issue and will continue to have conversations with other leaders about it.\xc2\xa0 This is -- has definitely -- is definitely a focus of our efforts right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on the continuing resolution debate, is the President open to signing a short-term continuing resolution that does have some spending cuts in it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, there are two broad points to make here.\xc2\xa0 One, the President made clear when he released his budget that he believes we need to cut spending.\xc2\xa0 Democrats on the Hill have also said that they agree, we need to cut spending, as have Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wants to work together, the President wants to work together with the leaders of Congress, both parties, to make that happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the continuing resolution, the short-term funding of the bill, how that process will be negotiated out, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge different options.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that we -- two things:\xc2\xa0 that we can work something out, and that the American people absolutely want us to work something out, because as the leaders of both houses of Congress have said, Republican and Democrat, as the President has said, it is not in the interests of the American people for the government to shut down.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because -- principally because of the impact it could have on our economy.\xc2\xa0 We are still in the stages of recovery here, and the negative consequences of a shutdown, the uncertainty that that would create, could be detrimental to our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President encouraged or discouraged by what he\xe2\x80\x99s watching take place right now between Speaker Boehner and Senator Reid?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes the leaders of the House and the Senate need to get together to work something out.\xc2\xa0 And he and senior members of the administration are engaged in conversations on the Hill as well.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, there is a congressional process here that has to work.\xc2\xa0 The House passes something, the Senate passes something, compromises are worked out.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also participating in that process because we believe we can work together to get something done, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Last week the President suggested one consequence of a government shutdown would be Social Security checks not going out.\xc2\xa0 During the Clinton shutdowns, Social Security checks did continue going out.\xc2\xa0 Is there reason to believe it would be different this time around?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we can find the common ground that we need to find in order to avoid a government shutdown, and that leaders in both parties agree that that\xe2\x80\x99s what we need to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was pointing out some of the consequences, the potential consequences of failing to act, of failing to prevent a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 And some recipients, new retirees, new applications might not receive their checks.\xc2\xa0 If retirees have questions about their checks, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get their check in the mail, if they have a change of address, all those things could prevent them from getting their check.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are obviously consequences that directly affect people who are recipients of Social Security benefits, and there could be.\xc2\xa0 But the broader point is that the uncertainty created by this, the number of consequences that could unfold if this does happen, would create the kind of environment that would be harmful to the economy overall, which would then -- Speaker of the House said yesterday he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on jobs and the economy; the President makes clear every day, as he will this afternoon when he speaks with his new council on jobs and competitiveness, that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we do not want and we do not believe the leaders of Congress and we know the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t want actions to be taken in Washington that upset this recovery, set us back, affect growth and affect job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Glenn.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there are reports on the ground from Benghazi and other cities of people being killed -- a woman, for instance, I think this was Tripoli, there was a report of a woman being shot for standing on the balcony to sort of look out and see what was going on.\xc2\xa0 There was a quote I think in a CNN dispatch today of a person in a crowd in Benghazi saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are being murdered and the world is just standing by.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday said the world is watching.\xc2\xa0 What is the message the administration is giving to the people who are being killed right now in Libya about what the United States intends to do to keep this kind of thing from happening to people who are simply exercising their desire for freedom?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear that we absolutely support the people of Libya, the people of Bahrain, the people of Egypt, other people who have peacefully expressed their desire for change in their country.\xc2\xa0 Again, I take you back to our governing principles as we approach these problems.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are working with the international community to take the kind of action that will prevent the Libyan government from continuing to wreak this kind of havoc on its own people.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about how strongly he condemns this action.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s abhorrent.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how does sending Secretary Clinton to a conference on Monday ameliorate the situation for people on the ground --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re interested in outcomes.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re interest in doing -- taking the measures that will actually have the desired effect, which is to get the Libyan government to stop the bloodshed.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been absolutely focused --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me speak to Glenn here.\xc2\xa0 The President is absolutely focused on this, as is Secretary Clinton and the rest of the national security team.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that more forceful -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a bit about sort of the Americans on the ground -- is there a concern that a more forceful response by the administration could result in more bloodshed against Libyan protestors?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what might happen, but anytime you have a situation like this you have to gauge what the response will be to the actions you take.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fluid, dynamic and dangerous situation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to getting this right so that the Libyan people are no longer subjected to the kind of violence that they\xe2\x80\x99re being subjected to by their government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back on the situation with Libya.\xc2\xa0 Protests have just been spreading in North Africa and the Middle East; the result is gas prices going up here in America.\xc2\xa0 Is this administration asking countries in Africa that support -- that I guess export oil to us -- is this administration asking Canada, is this administration asking Mexico, is this administration asking Saudi Arabia to increase their output to keep prices down?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, whenever you have unrest in this part of the world, there are going to be reactions in the oil markets, and that is obviously something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 The situation remains fluid, but we are monitoring this closely.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very cognizant of the fact that oil prices can affect the economy and can affect people in their wallets and pocketbooks.\xc2\xa0 But we are in touch with the IEA and oil-producing countries about the developments in the market.\xc2\xa0 We have the capacity to act in the event of a major supply disruption.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on any particular action and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, again, speculate that -- predict what may or may not happen in terms of disruption.\xc2\xa0 But the global community has -- global system has a lot of experience in managing the kind of disruption that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and our focus now is on monitoring this and making sure that we know what our options are if they need to be taken.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue of supply and demand for the sweet crude.\xc2\xa0 And is the administration concerned that analysts, oil analysts, are talking about the possibility of $5 a gallon?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we saw $4.11 a gallon at its height and people were really upset then.\xc2\xa0 The economy was starting to show signs of breaking.\xc2\xa0 So what is happening right now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can assure you, April, that we are very closely watching this situation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on where oil prices may or may not go or what the effects of unrest in Libya may or may not have tomorrow or next week or down the road on oil prices.\xc2\xa0 But we have the capacity to act in case of a major supply disruption, and we are talking with international institutions and other -- and oil-producing nations to -- as we examine the developments in the markets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s question real quick?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given what Glenn says, that there are people being killed en masse right now in Libya, what is the timeline for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s getting the international community together and getting a tangible response to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xc2\xa0 What is -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the timeframe?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can assure you we are working on this aggressively, and specifically with the goal of taking action that can be most effective, most efficiently.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell you that this is going to happen tomorrow and then something else will happen in two or three days because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about actions that we are coordinating with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview, again, take options on or off -- take options off the table.\xc2\xa0 But believe me, we are moving very quickly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coordination -- coordinating an international response to something is basically the definition of herding cats, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very fast-moving situation over in Libya.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell me what the timeline is, is there even a timeline for getting a response in place?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would point you to the fact -- look at the international reaction.\xc2\xa0 This is a case where what Libya has done has garnered very little support around the globe -- quite the contrary.\xc2\xa0 The international community is speaking almost with -- entirely with one voice in condemning what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this is a case of herding cats.\xc2\xa0 I believe that this is an opportunity to act in a concerted way with our international partners.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no timeline for a specific --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a timeline.\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me -- yes, Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the -- sort of following up a little bit on April\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Several Democratic members of Congress have asked the President to consider releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep prices from rising too much.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that he\xe2\x80\x99s considering?\xc2\xa0 How does he react to these members\xe2\x80\x99 of Congress request?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would just repeat what I said, which is that we have the capacity to act in case of a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 Right now we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re simply monitoring the situation and discussing with the IEA and oil-producing states what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the markets, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview what might happen if a further disruption happens and what our options are.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama back in August of 2008 advocated using oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve back in August \xe2\x80\x9808 when the price of oil was about $120 a barrel.\xc2\xa0 At what price would President Obama want to release oil?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important about that to remember is that the causes of the surge in oil prices in 2008 were quite different from the circumstances that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now.\xc2\xa0 And then I would say that we are examining our options and we have the capacity if necessary to act in case of a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a one-size-fits-all response when the actual circumstances are quite different.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we do another topic, Jay?\xc2\xa0 Please, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- all the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your name with the glasses.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 My name is Sarah.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sarah.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 My question is if we should have a government shutdown, would the people still get paid, or -- I was going to ask about Social Security, because obviously that would affect me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is that -- what you just said, that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be touched?\xc2\xa0 Or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet, or what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- first of all, part of the problem is the uncertainty that it creates.\xc2\xa0 But there are what I -- the point I want to make very clearly is that we believe we can work together with Congress to avoid a shutdown because we all agree that a shutdown would be disruptive to the economy, affect our capacity to grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an outcome that no one -- we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want and the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t want.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict what might happen in a circumstance that we very much hope to avoid.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 About the uprisings.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that all the nations are different and all the relationships are different.\xc2\xa0 So then what metrics is the administration using to evaluate that an uprising in one country is different from an uprising in another country and that the response should be different from one country to another?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because each country is different there -- you have to measure that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re guided by these principles that I talked about yesterday that were enunciated by the President in his speech in Cairo, about the need for the countries in the region to respond to the aspirations, the democratic aspirations of their peoples, because they had a problem on their hands.\xc2\xa0 And that still pertains, that is our approach:\xc2\xa0 no violence; respect for the universal rights of your citizens; and actions, reforms, that respond to the demands and aspirations that are legitimate of the people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of how you evaluate, again, these are events that are happening from the ground up.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen them -- in Egypt, how the people on the streets represented all walks of life in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we look at that in each country and how broad-based the unrest is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fundamentally, peaceful demonstrations should never be responded to with violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some other topic, Jay?\xc2\xa0 Jay, some other topic?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another international story, is there any comment from the White House about the extradition of Julian Assange to Sweden?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no comment on that because it\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is meeting with Richard Trumka today, along with Hilda Solis, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why the President was not on that list and does -- did the President drop in on that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President did, but I will double-check.\xc2\xa0 And if he did, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he did and this was a long-scheduled meeting.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Vice President meets with labor leaders periodically.\xc2\xa0 This is -- has been scheduled for quite a while.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re right in the middle of a big labor fracas.\xc2\xa0 Is the President trying to keep his distance from this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made very clear, as all of you wrote about and many of you made more of than what was actually the case, his view on the need for public sector employees to tighten their belts just like everyone else in these -- as we all try to get control of our budgets at the state level and the federal level -- but his concern that what not happen is that the fiscal problems that states find themselves in be used as an excuse to go after the fundamental bargaining rights, collective bargaining rights, the sort of underlying foundation of unions.\xc2\xa0 So I think he made his position on that very clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, a different topic, following yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s decision by the Department of Justice to drop its defense of DOMA, members of Congress have reintroduced legislation to actually overturn the law.\xc2\xa0 Considering that the administration now has a position that DOMA is unconstitutional, will we be expecting support from the President for these pieces of legislation to make the law inoperative?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has long believed that DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, is an unnecessary and unfair law.\xc2\xa0 He supports the repeal of the law.\xc2\xa0 As for its constitutionality, obviously he made clear his views on that in the decision he made that was announced yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But he does support the repeal, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michael.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, why did the President tell us that Ray Davis --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Michaels in here.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President tell us -- why did the President tell us that Ray Davis was a diplomat?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Mr. Davis was received by the government of Pakistan as an employee of the embassy and he was granted diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Conventions.\xc2\xa0 And what we are saying very clearly is that he needs to be released in accordance with those treaties, which apply to the personnel of countries -- not just the United States in foreign countries, but Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s employees in the United States and around the globe, and every other country that are participatory -- that participate in those important treaties.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamental principle that can\xe2\x80\x99t be compromised.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not misleading in any way for the President to say this man is a diplomat, when he in fact was working for the Central Intelligence Agency?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What he said -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is the fact that he was received by the Pakistani government as an employee of the embassy, of the United States embassy, and had the protections of the Vienna Conventions.\xc2\xa0 And that needs to pertain and needs to hold true and he needs to be released according to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michael.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency, is there any guidance White House officials get about when it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to meet off campus with a lobbyist and when a lobbyist meeting should be on campus?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This administration has taken extraordinary actions to be transparent.\xc2\xa0 I think this question stems from a story that, frankly, was absurd.\xc2\xa0 We release hundreds of thousands of records voluntarily, a policy instituted by this President because of his desire for transparency -- something no administration had ever done before.\xc2\xa0 The decisions about where -- and those records are available to every American citizen online to be reviewed, and all different types of people come to the White House complex for meetings on issues.\xc2\xa0 And our level of transparency and disclosure is unprecedented because the President believes deeply in it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that, as any of you who have walked around this complex know, been in the West Wing -- not like the TV show; very small space, very few meeting rooms.\xc2\xa0 The Old Executive Office Building -- the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a third of which has been under renovation since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here -- very limited space.\xc2\xa0 Jackson Place is a White House conference center -- so designated -- and therefore when we have large meetings sometimes we use that space if there are no spaces here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you agree that there\xe2\x80\x99s effectively a transparency loophole here, if the goal is to show when lobbyists, powerful interests, are meeting with White House officials, that right now it\xe2\x80\x99s routine for White House officials to meet off campus with these people and there\xe2\x80\x99s no daylight on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is routine for the White House officials to meet with all types of people, including lobbyists, and frequently here.\xc2\xa0 The suggestion that we\xe2\x80\x99re not being transparent is laughable given the unbelievable precedent this administration has set in its -- closing the door, the revolving door, and releasing these records.\xc2\xa0 There are no -- the WAVES system, which is the system that produces the records, operates in certain buildings and not others.\xc2\xa0 And for those decisions, how that operates and why, I refer you to the United States Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 But the principle here is the unprecedented level of transparency that we have provided because we believe deeply in it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be inappropriate for a White House official to intentionally arrange a meeting off campus to not be caught by the WAVES records?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have meetings with all sorts of people.\xc2\xa0 We have them here.\xc2\xa0 Those records are available.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would it be appropriate if you choose to go off campus because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to show up in the files?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s yes or no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The guiding principle here is transparency, and we believe that -- nobody is, that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, is hiding where they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting.\xc2\xa0 The meetings that happen at Jackson Place, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big meeting place and that\xe2\x80\x99s where --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s so big, why not change the policy and release those names --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do not control where the WAVES is.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- in terms of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could release them separately.\xc2\xa0 You could change the policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware what policies might be instituted in the future.\xc2\xa0 But what I think is fundamentally important to remind you of is that we release information that has never been released before.\xc2\xa0 I think you probably remember, you were covering the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 They went to court, to the Supreme Court, to prevent the disclosure of people who were meeting with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 We voluntarily release the records that are available to us.\xc2\xa0 And we never said that there was a way to get every name in every meeting.\xc2\xa0 The principle is disclosure, and we have gone to extraordinary lengths to make that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you consider changing the policy to increase disclosure?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict about future policies that may be put in place.\xc2\xa0 I just want to remind everybody about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done and why.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on this side?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The woman in red.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the level of concern in the White House about the nine metric tons of mustard gas that are currently stockpiled in Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to move quickly on Libya today.\xc2\xa0 But the President said yesterday, Wednesday, that Secretary Clinton will be going to Europe on Monday to consult with the Human Rights Council.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s five days.\xc2\xa0 A lot of Libyans can die in five days.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, Secretary Burns is also traveling to deal with this issue.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton, the President, officials at every level of the national security team are working on this full time.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, in addition -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite finished -- in addition, my other question was, you said it\xe2\x80\x99s very important for us to speak as one international voice.\xc2\xa0 Some of the European counterparts are already calling for sanctions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing options with --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not join in with them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are absolutely interested in examining sanctions as a possible option.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re examining all options and we will have -- we will take action as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Jared.\xc2\xa0 Yeah.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the European counterparts, you said at the top of the briefing that Cameron and Sarkozy are getting calls from the President.\xc2\xa0 Is there any outreach to Hu and Medvedev to get the other members of the U.N. Security Council P5 for something on that level?\xc2\xa0 Is that on the table?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be discussing, having conversations with other foreign leaders going forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on who, specifically, or what contacts the State Department might be making or our ambassador at the U.N.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go here, sorry.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President makes phone calls like the two that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make today, there\xe2\x80\x99s always some groundwork before them.\xc2\xa0 So would you describe this as a decision call on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen next with these two other leaders, or is this just continuing the consultations?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, on the assets of Qaddafi and his family, the Swiss government today has frozen the assets of Qaddafi, his sons and the rest of the family.\xc2\xa0 Are the wheels in motion for that to happen here?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we are examining a variety of options and that we will move as quickly as possible to implement them.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the arrest in Texas, does the White House believe President Bush was a target?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the details of this investigation, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama spoken to President Bush about this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he has, but President Bush was notified.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a follow-up on that?\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I ask a follow-up on that?\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of allegations that this student, who is a Saudi who was arrested, should not have been in this country.\xc2\xa0 Is there a loophole in the immigration system?\xc2\xa0 Should the screening process be tightened to screen out potential jihadists?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on this investigation in any capacity, so -- I mean, in any detail.\xc2\xa0 Questions about immigration I direct you to DHS.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three other topics, please?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements on presidential travel.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, on the Somali pirates.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been nothing said in the few days since the Americans were slaughtered.\xc2\xa0 There are some increasing calls to bomb the headquarters of the Somali pirates.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sort of strategy?\xc2\xa0 What are you going to do with them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would not and could not speak about operations that may or may not happen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that anything is happening, Connie, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something I would talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything in public?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we -- obviously outraged by the actions of pirates that result in the deaths of American citizens.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as you know, I believe has expressed his sincere condolences to the families of the victims.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into details.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict what the Libyan government will do.\xc2\xa0 But what I do know is that this administration, leaders of governments around the world are outraged and appalled by what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen in Libya and will take and are taking the actions that they believe will be most effective in changing the behavior of the Libyan government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would any sanctions be partly designed not necessarily just targeting Qaddafi, but family members, other power centers that might kind of convince them to try and peel away from Qaddafi?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would only say that we\xe2\x80\x99re examining a variety of options.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>\n\t2:11 P.M.
