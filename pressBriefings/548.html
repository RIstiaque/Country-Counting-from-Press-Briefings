EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 What can I do for you?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, we have a lot of very detailed questions and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to get them underway right out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that, yes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m at your service.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When should we expect the President to sign the debt ceiling bill?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I checked on that before we left and we had not received the bill.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have any updates on that for you right now, but as soon as I do we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate did send it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to do tomorrow and Sunday and Monday?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President looks forward to meeting with King Abdullah this evening at -- meeting with him tonight and then a working dinner afterwards.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jordan is an invaluable partner and close friend of the United States, and Sunnylands provides a real intimate opportunity to discuss a lot of the issues they face both in that region and around the globe.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long is the King\xe2\x80\x99s stay?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk to them about their schedule.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner.\xc2\xa0 Are there other activities?\xc2\xa0 When he was here with President Xi, for example, they went for a walk and had a private conversation.\xc2\xa0 There was a presentation of a gift.\xc2\xa0 Are things like that going to be happening tonight?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We expect a working dinner -- sorry -- the meeting and then the working dinner.\xc2\xa0 And then I don\'t anticipate a public schedule beyond that over the weekend.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re at Sunnylands.\xc2\xa0 He was here last June and now he\xe2\x80\x99s back.\xc2\xa0 Is there something about Sunnylands that has brought him back two times in the past year?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President really enjoys the opportunity to sort of have an informal, intimate discussion with a leader that he\xe2\x80\x99s so close with, King Abdullah, and out of the swirl of Washington.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more conducive to a conversation, given all the issues they face and given their warm relationship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about Fresno.\xc2\xa0 One of the central elements of the Feinstein-Boxer bill involves flowing water from north to south in California, and part of that can be done administratively.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to encourage that in his appearance in Fresno?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are encouraged by progress in the Senate on efforts to ease the pain of this historic drought and we hope that Congress will advance that legislation swiftly.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a number of complex and dynamic issues going on at the same time and there\xe2\x80\x99s no easy answer -- until California just gets more rain -- and that requires additional discussion with our state, local and congressional partners.\xc2\xa0 But we look forward to continuing those conversations as this legislation moves forward.</p>\n<p class="p2">Today, we\'re very pleased to note that several state and federal agencies are working together to allow for the maximum pumping of water, consistent with state and federal regulations, including requirements that protect health and safety during the course of this drought.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the House bill that Republicans say would address the drought?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, we put out a position of administrative policy on that a while ago, but the short version is this would not alleviate the effects of California\xe2\x80\x99s current drought and would disrupt decades of work that supports building consensus solutions and settlements that equitably address some of California\xe2\x80\x99s most complex water challenges.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will the President be doing Saturday, Sunday and Monday?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t anticipate a public schedule for this weekend.\xc2\xa0 If that changes I\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have any other -- what will he be doing for his personal time?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President has enjoyed the golf course on Sunnylands before and I would not be surprised if he does that again this trip.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- enjoyed the cuisine of Bobby Flay I think the last time he was out here.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a special celebrity chef along or coming out to Sunnylands?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that, but is that you fishing for an invite?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just fishing for information.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Jordan and Syrian refugees, is there anything that the U.S. can do further to help Jordan absorb refugees from Syria?\xc2\xa0 And do you expect that to be part of the discussion with the King?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I do expect that to be a conversation with the King.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to working with Jordan to support the more than 600,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan and Jordan host communities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working together with the U.N. to press for greater humanitarian access inside Syria, and the United States and Jordan both strongly support the Geneva II process and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian conflict.\xc2\xa0 I expect them to very much discuss this this evening.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us -- we know that Congressman Costa and Senators Feinstein and Boxer are on the plane.\xc2\xa0 Is there anyone else on the plane, either political or friends of the President who are traveling to California?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Am I not good enough?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re awesome.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the drought, I think those are the people that would be of most interest to you.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how about for Sunnylands -- are there any -- no other guests?\xc2\xa0 We left the House Democratic retreat, where he spoke earlier today.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk with us about what commitments he\xe2\x80\x98s made toward fundraising for Democrats -- House Democrats between now and the midterm elections?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, but I want to be clear that the conversation this morning, even after you all left, was very much focused on the legislative agenda for 2014 and sort of talking about the economic opportunity framework laid out in the State of the Union and how they can work on achieving that together over the course of the next 11 months.</p>\n<p class="p2">In terms of what he is going to do in the midterms, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the outside groups coordinating that.\xc2\xa0 I think there were several announcements over the weekend and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have anything more to add.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any more specifics about what he told them at the retreat?\xc2\xa0 You said they talked -- what sort of legislative items?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think definitely minimum wage came up, a lot of the sort of underpinnings of the economic opportunity framework that the President laid out at the State of the Union, and also the ways the President is going to use the pen and the phone to exercise his executive authority to help the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House reacted at all to this idea of doing a discharge petition to move immigration forward, which Senator Schumer said he supported?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We have laid out our principles on this and we now believe it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Congress to work its will.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So discharge petition is -- that would be okay?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually said we\xe2\x80\x99re going to step back\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this has been very clear, he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out his principles, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a step back.\xc2\xa0 The Senate obviously passed a bill and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let the House work its way.\xc2\xa0 We hope very much that immigration reform becomes a reality.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you happen to know if King Abdullah had some other reason to come to California?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious about whether he\xe2\x80\x99s flying across the country just for this one dinner for the President and if that\xe2\x80\x99s actually something he asked for?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Jordanians for that question.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we ask about stuff that may or may not have come up during the retreat?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Iran come up?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, as a topic.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific conversations between members and the President. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out every Q&amp;A back and forth with the President but this was a good try on the new guy.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President and Mrs. Obama feel about being apart on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Zach, I had no idea you were such a romantic. But as you know, the First Lady actually got asked this question I think last week by Ryan Seacrest about their Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day plans.\xc2\xa0 She said they\xe2\x80\x99re going to low-key it this year, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to leave it at that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know where she is today or this weekend?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s office for questions on her travel schedule.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect in the Fresno stop -- I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, but can we expect the President to talk about climate change and greenhouse gases in connection to the drought in California?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, no single episode of extreme weather -- no storm, no flood, no drought -- can be said to have been caused by global climate change.\xc2\xa0 But the science is clear that weather practically everywhere is being influenced by climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the White House position not that it\xe2\x80\x99s just climate change but that it is manmade climate change, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that are --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Dr. Holdren read out a lot of sort of the science on the call yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d just refer you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming remarks.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to talk about this climate fund while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Fresno?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us any more about that?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I am happy to.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to keep making the case to the American people that we\xe2\x80\x99re already being hurt by climate change.\xc2\xa0 The pain will only get worse for our children and grandchildren if we leave it for future generations to deal with.\xc2\xa0 And even if Republicans in Congress refuse to take common-sense steps to cut back on carbon pollution, you\xe2\x80\x99d think that they\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in joining us to make sure that our communities are prepared for increasingly severe weather that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously experiencing.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the fund a pen and phone thing, or does he need Congress to sign off on that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 One minute.\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, 2015 budget, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be releasing next month that will include a $1 billion Climate Resilience Fund.\xc2\xa0 Through this fund, the President hopes to take major steps.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier today, Jay said that they\xe2\x80\x99re not previewing items from the upcoming budget, but this is being previewed.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think because we are -- the President wanted to go to Fresno and hear directly from folks about the challenges that they face from this historic drought -- farmers, ranchers, small businessmen -- and also propose concrete action items that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President felt strongly that he should be able to talk to them about what he believes that the federal government should be doing to help.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to get on the record, if there is golf later this weekend, is the White House committing to releasing a full list of friends, donors, celebrity athletes, anyone with whom the President may be golfing?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it is our standard process to let you know when the President golfs and who it is with.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any foreign leader calls so far or expected on the flight?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out for you right now, but I will let you know if that changes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 King Abdullah is arriving separately at Sunnylands on his own --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on his travel.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the plane?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But I do have a week ahead.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Do you have one more, Steve?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">On Monday, the President will return from Rancho Mirage, California.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will deliver remarks at an event on the economy in the Washington, D.C. area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">On Wednesday, the President will travel to Toluca, Mexico to participate in the North American Leaders Summit.\xc2\xa0 At the summit, the President will discuss a wide range of issues including economic competitiveness and citizen security with the Mexican President and Canadian Prime Minister.</p>\n<p class="p3">On Thursday, the President will return from Toluca and attend the Democratic Governors Association dinner.</p>\n<p class="p2">And on Friday, the President will meet with Democratic governors in town for the annual NGA Winter Meeting to discuss his \xe2\x80\x9cOpportunity For All\xe2\x80\x9d agenda and the \xe2\x80\x9cYear of Action.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the NGA dinner at the White House or somewhere else?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s at the White House, but I have to double-check.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know about the Tuesday economic -- what do we know about that?\xc2\xa0 The Tuesday economic event?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us more?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more for that as it becomes available.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Olympics, has the President been watching the Olympics?\xc2\xa0 Can you fill us in?\xc2\xa0 Is he watching -- is there a feed right now?\xc2\xa0 What does he like?\xc2\xa0 Does he like the slope stuff or skating?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he into?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously an avid sports fan. He\xe2\x80\x99s been enjoying the Olympics, as we all have.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific color to read out to you right now, though.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to watch \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of Cards\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I heard a movement that they were trying to release it early.\xc2\xa0 Did that happen?\xc2\xa0 Is it today?\xc2\xa0 I will have to ask.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did your first gaggle go?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You guys can be the judge.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t2:25 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
