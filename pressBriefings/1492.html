EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We have several briefers here this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We have Gary Samore, who is the Coordinator for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation over at the National Security Council, who is going to be briefing on tomorrow\'s summit.\xc2\xa0 We have also brought over Ambassador Alex Wolff, who is our Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 They are going to start off because Gary has to run off to a meeting.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll turn it over to Mike McFaul, who will read out the President\'s meeting just concluded with President Medvedev of Russia.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So, Gary, if I can ask you to come up and kick off.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the Big Apple -- got mine here.\xc2\xa0 I just want to say a few things about the U.N. Security Council summit tomorrow on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">This is the first time in history that the Council at the summit level -- or I think at any level -- has focused an entire session on these set of issues.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that reflects the importance that President Obama places on his efforts as he laid out in his Prague speech.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The important elements in the Prague speech, as you\'ll recall there were three main pieces of the strategy.\xc2\xa0 The first is nuclear disarmament -- that is to say the countries that have nuclear weapons taking steps to eliminate them -- including a new arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia; the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty being ratified and eventually being brought into force; and a treaty to end the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The second element is the non-proliferation element, preventing additional countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And that involves strengthening the NPT, the inspections, making sure that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the resources and authority to carry out its mission; making sure that the U.N. Security Council plays its role in terms of taking actions in the cases of noncompliance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And the third element of the U.S. strategy as President Obama has laid out is encouraging peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a safe manner.\xc2\xa0 That includes careful controls on sensitive nuclear materials and technology.\xc2\xa0 It includes efforts to try to develop a new architecture for international nuclear cooperation, such as multilateral fuel banks.\xc2\xa0 And it includes steps to make sure that nuclear materials are secure and they\'re not vulnerable to theft by criminal groups or terrorists.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So we hope that the Security Council meeting tomorrow will provide an opportunity for the 15 leaders and some important members from international organizations to discuss those issues and to pass a resolution that would endorse the key parts of the President\'s overall strategy, including some fairly technical matters which the Security Council has never spoken on before -- and in particular, the Security Council is the only international institution that has the authority and the responsibility to take action to ensure that those cases of proliferation that pose a threat to international peace and security are appropriately addressed, including violations of the NPT.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So we think that is the main value that the Security Council has in taking on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask Ambassador Wolff to talk a little bit about the choreography of the meeting tomorrow and how it will actually be conducted.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Alex.</div> <div class="legacy-para">AMBASSADOR WOLFF:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Gary.\xc2\xa0 The session will start tomorrow at 9:15 a.m., as Gary mentioned.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have all 15 members represented either at the head of state or head of government level.\xc2\xa0 I believe we\'ll have 12 heads of state, three heads of government.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary General will be attending and speaking, as will Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the IAEA.\xc2\xa0 We expect to adopt the resolution at the top of the meeting and if everything goes as planned, as we expect, it should be adopted unanimously and universally supported by all members.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President would be of course in the chair running the meeting and would make some opening brief remarks; turn it over to the Secretary General; and then the heads of state or government would then follow in an order that was done by draw; and we\'ll wrap up with Mr. ElBaradei finishing up the events.\xc2\xa0 So if everything goes as planned, we\'ll have the session done with within about two hours.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the vote is at the beginning, not the end?</div> <div class="legacy-para">AMBASSADOR WOLFF:\xc2\xa0 Voting would be at the top, at the beginning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, in the draft resolution that\'s bouncing around there are three or four items that seem to indicate you\'re kind of laying some kind of legal architecture for a response to either a state that leaves the NPT or states that violate their obligations under the IAEA and the NPT, and I wonder if you could address that, exactly what you\'re trying to do there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we want to talk about the specific provisions because the resolution hasn\'t been adopted yet, but as I said in my opening remarks, the Security Council has a unique and distinctive role in the international regime, because it\'s the only body that has the authority and the responsibility to address issues of non-compliance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And we looked to the Security Council, given its broad mandate, to act in cases of threats to peace and security to carry out that role.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that this resolution can enforce and strengthen that role, that\'s a major accomplishment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit, as this draft resolution has been going around -- my understanding was that you guys have been seeking to strengthen pieces of it, make it stronger and have met some resistance over the last couple of days, especially from the French, to that effort.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\'s the man who has done all the heavy lifting.\xc2\xa0 So he should answer that question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">AMBASSADOR WOLFF:\xc2\xa0 I think most of the discussion that we had on strengthening the resolution itself was the classic discussion that you would have in this type of negotiation.\xc2\xa0 Of course if you look at the composition of the 15 members of the Security Council, they come from varying positions on the issue. We have the five declared nuclear powers, and there\'s the Permanent Five members of the Security Council, the elected members, not of which, of course, are nuclear powers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So in terms of the focus each have, some wanted an accent more on disarmament issues, some wanted an accent more on non-proliferation issues -- again, the sort of thing one would normally expect in this type of negotiation.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We also want to make it clear that there is a deliberate effort here to focus on this issue comprehensively, and not use this meeting to focus on any specific country or problem.\xc2\xa0 The resolution reflects that as well.\xc2\xa0 It is, in effect, a framework for how we deal with these issues.\xc2\xa0 And we have regimes in place for dealing with individual cases.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would this resolution apply to countries that are not signatories to the NPT?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 Well, the U.S. position is that all countries should join the NPT, and so the resolution will address that issue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not illegal to not join the NPT?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not illegal, absolutely right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the Security Council going to assert authority that they can do things to countries that don\'t wish to or have never signed up then?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\'t want to get into the details of the resolution.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have to look at that tomorrow after it\'s been adopted.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of establishing the U.N. Security Council\'s call on countries to adhere to the NPT, that\'s something that we would hope the -- that the resolution would endorse.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it change anything to the PSI?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 PSI, Proliferation Security Initiative, does it change --</div> <div class="legacy-para">AMBASSADOR WOLFF:\xc2\xa0 No, it doesn\'t change anything at all.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t touch on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 All right, any more questions before we turn it over to our next briefer?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, I mean, I don\'t know if this is for Mr. McFaul, but can you give us any kind of update on the START follow-on talks?\xc2\xa0 Mike, is that one for you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. SAMORE:\xc2\xa0 That\'s for Mike.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 A perfect lead-in for Mike McFaul, who is our Senior Director at the National Security Council for Russia.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So, Mike.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I actually don\'t have a readout.\xc2\xa0 I think the Presidents did a fantastic job of reading out the meeting exactly as it was.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I can improve upon that, so I\'ll just take your questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering about the Medvedev comments on sanctions, which went a little bit further than he\'s gone before. I assume you guys expected that, and I just want to get a feeling for how that came about and if you could address whether it was tied to the missile defense decision by the Russians, if not by you guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you heard the President say, President Obama, and was discussed in the meeting that we actually do share common strategic objectives when it comes to Iran.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t shared them --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t shared them before.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s important to realize.\xc2\xa0 And again, I don\'t want to try to do better than President Medvedev himself did in his statements. But when he said we do not have an interest in Iran having nuclear weapons, we are coming together in terms of a shared set of strategic objectives.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t really see any daylight about our objectives right now, vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Iran.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asking whether it\'s the same, I was asking how it came about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 That strategy -- so the strategy -- once you have common strategic objectives, you have to have a common strategy.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama could not be clearer that we have two paths.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s made it clear that he seeks a diplomatic solution, but we\'re not going to do that forever and we\'re not going to haggle about that indefinitely.\xc2\xa0 And if there\'s a time and a point when we have to switch to a different -- the second strategy, the more coercive strategy, we need to do that as a -- unified, and we want to do that with Russia.\xc2\xa0 And the way I read President Medvedev\'s statement and the whole conversation was that he agrees.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how did he get there?\xc2\xa0 Because it\'s a little different than where he has been.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Well, the whole project from day one in U.S.-Russia relations, and it\'s President Obama\'s view, is we\'re not going to trade, we\'re not going to give you this for that, and some kind of bizarre transactions.\xc2\xa0 We are -- as he said very articulately I thought, and very clearly in his speech in Moscow -- we\'re going to pursue our interests, our national security interests in all spheres at all times.\xc2\xa0 And on most of those issues, the coda in that speech and the coda of every conversation we\'ve had with the President -- with the Russians, at the highest levels on down, is on most strategic issues that the United States is pursuing, we don\'t see a disagreement with the Russians.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think over time, we have come to a place in U.S.-Russian relations where President Medvedev now has embraced that and sees that in fact we do have a lot more common interests in terms of just our interests as two countries as opposed to maybe where we were six or eight months ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, when you talked about we don\'t -- we\'re not going to trade, is that redressing this idea of this freeze-for-freeze idea; they stop enriching for six weeks and we stop seeking sanctions --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t mean to misconstrue.\xc2\xa0 I was talking more about with the Russians, not with the Iranians.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any comment on the freeze-for-freeze --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, can you tell us how much of the conversation today was about the steps beyond once the negotiations are concluded or once -- once we have the initial meetings with the Iranians in October?\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot of belief that these are -- that that may well not go very well.\xc2\xa0 How much of the conversation focused on what to do next on sanctions and on the next steps?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Almost the entire meeting was about Iran and it was about strategies -- not strategy -- for achieving our objectives in both tracks.\xc2\xa0 And I think it wouldn\'t be appropriate for us to talk about what Mr. Medvedev said.\xc2\xa0 You can ask him and his folks.\xc2\xa0 But there was a detailed discussion about several strategies, not just one, for achieving that -- our common strategic objectives.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there -- did you notice a difference now in the conversation and the tenor of the conversation between Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Obama on the strategies for dealing with Iran?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel -- are the Russians sounding more like they\'re on board with us?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, in two respects.\xc2\xa0 I want to remind you all that it wasn\'t that long ago where we had very divergent definitions of the threat and definitions of our strategic objectives vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Iran.\xc2\xa0 That seems to me to be a lot closer, if not almost together.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\'d just refer you to what the two Presidents just said.\xc2\xa0 I couldn\'t have said it better.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And on the strategies, of course -- I mean, President Medvedev said -- again, I\'d rather you use his words, not mine -- but for the Presidents to go both in discussion and publicly to say, we don\'t like sanctions but under certain conditions they are necessary.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- to me that\'s a very big change in their position.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what do you credit that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s -- you read his mind.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it has to do with this is in Russia\'s national interest as well.\xc2\xa0 Is it in Russia\'s -- but I don\'t want to speculate about his thinking.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what\'s changed?\xc2\xa0 It\'s been in Russia\'s interest for years.\xc2\xa0 What\'s changed now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only thing we see that\'s changed is the missile thing, so that\'s how we read it.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been told something else to read in --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would just say it\'s bigger than that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s trying to develop a strategic relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 It\'s trying to say we have common interests that are not just this thing for that thing, but a bigger framework.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a lot of interests.\xc2\xa0 Today was all about Iran, but in July, we spent a great deal of time about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And before nine months ago, we didn\'t talk about Afghanistan as a common threat. Now we do.\xc2\xa0 This one I think we\'ve achieved that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So it\'s about the definition of our interests.\xc2\xa0 And let\'s just be clear, those things change over time.\xc2\xa0 People rethink them, as we have as a government, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I would attribute it to.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michael, are you denying completely that the shift in U.S. strategy on this missile defense actually did improve the climate for these kind of talks and may have --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Let me be very clear as somebody who is in every single meeting on missile defense, from the lowest to the highest levels, the notion that we need to do what we did as a concession for Russia never was brought up.\xc2\xa0 And I just defer -- I refer you to Secretary Gates.\xc2\xa0 There is nobody that could say it clearer than him.\xc2\xa0 He said it -- and when the historic -- I know you\'re looking at me like -- but hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 I\'m getting to -- okay. So we did that and we did our review because of the threat in Iran, and that is what we did.\xc2\xa0 Is it the case that it changes the climate?\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s true, of course.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not cause and effect I guess is what I\'m trying to say. The causal arrow is the other way around for me.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you\'re talking about the very big change in the Russian position, is that sort of similar to what -- you\'re getting that from President Medvedev saying that sanctions may be inevitable -- sort of a step he\'s making in that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Again, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said it any clearer, as far as I\'m concerned.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just got his comments, by the way.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I\'m sorry, I\'m sorry, okay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 It becomes clearer after -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, that to me -- he could not have been clearer about what he was trying to communicate to the world today.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s something -- I don\'t want to -- he said it in other ways, but he was crystal clear as far as I was concerned today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you used the phrase coercive strategies -- is that limited to sanctions?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- we can\'t talk about that.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot more going on, I guess, in terms of strategies, but I think that\'s the principal one that they were focused on today, both our President and their President.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s a lot of other things, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 All right, Mike is going to have to run pretty soon, so one last question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to take issue a little bit, I mean, U.S. officials have been saying for years that the U.S. and Russia share a strategic goal of a non-nuclear Iran.\xc2\xa0 The Bush administration used to say that.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes down to the point Russia always has backed off -- watered-down sanctions, with blocked sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What evidence, concrete, do you have now that they\'re going to act differently if and when it gets to that point?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just refer you to what President Medvedev said.\xc2\xa0 I mean -- and you can go back and read the statements from what he said under the Bush administration and compare them, and they\'re different.\xc2\xa0 Now, why?\xc2\xa0 That\'s your -- I don\'t want to read their mind and try to figure that out, but I think we\'re at a different place in U.S.-Russia relations, as I just said.\xc2\xa0 As the President said very eloquently, we have common strategic objectives vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Iran, and when -- very clearly said, neither of our two countries want to see Iran have nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And President Medvedev could not have been clearer that he agrees with that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">That is a different position on the objective side.\xc2\xa0 And on the strategy side, again, the -- I can\'t improve on what President Medvedev said.\xc2\xa0 He could not have been clearer.\xc2\xa0 And that was the substance, of course, of what was -- of what was said privately as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just before you go, can you give us any kind of update on the START --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 We did discuss START, new START treaty, I guess we\'re calling it.\xc2\xa0 And both Presidents said, we are committed to getting that done on the timeline that they said.\xc2\xa0 They talked about some minor issues that need to be worked out, but the way I saw it was we are both firmly committed to making sure we get that arms control agreement done on the timeline that we had agreed to.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Okay, thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  5:49 P.M.
