Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:06 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0And happy belated Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day to all the fathers out there. \xc2\xa0Hope you all had a chance to relax with your kids, or a chance to call you father, or both. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim, nice to see you today. \xc2\xa0Do you want to get us started with questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0No announcements?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No announcements at the top.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I wanted to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s podcast with WTF. \xc2\xa0His use of the \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d word has created some stir in social media, which was part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s broader and deeper discussion of racism. \xc2\xa0But I wonder if his use of that was intended to be provocative? \xc2\xa0And given the reaction, does he in any way regret using it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He does not. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word and the reason that he used the word could not be more apparent from the context of his discussion on the podcast. \xc2\xa0The President made clear that it\'s not possible to judge the nation\xe2\x80\x99s progress on race issues based solely on an evaluation of our country\xe2\x80\x99s manners. \xc2\xa0The fact is that we\'ve made undeniable progress in this country over the last several decades, and as the President himself has often said, anyone who lived in this country through the \xe2\x80\x9850s and the \xe2\x80\x9860s and the \xe2\x80\x9870s and the \xe2\x80\x9880s notes the tremendous progress that we\'ve made. \xc2\xa0That progress is undeniable.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also undeniable is that there is more work that needs to be done, and there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we can do. \xc2\xa0And the fact is everyone in this country should take some inspiration from the progress that was made in the previous generation and use that as a motivation and an inspiration to try to make further progress toward a more perfect union.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In Charleston, there are political leaders and religious leaders calling, as you know, for the Confederate flag to be taken down from the state capitol. \xc2\xa0And the President has said that the Confederate flag, in his estimation, belongs in a museum. \xc2\xa0But does the President believe that officials in South Carolina should take that flag down, or does he believe it should be up to the people of South Carolina to decide?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess I don\'t entirely understand your question. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, would the President call on them, on state officials, to take that flag down, or does he believe that that\'s a debate that should occur and that the people of South Carolina should decide whether the flag comes down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I\'m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction to be drawn there. \xc2\xa0The President is very clear about what his views are. \xc2\xa0The President talked about this as long ago as six or seven years ago where he shared his view that the Confederate flag should be taken down and placed in a museum where it belongs. \xc2\xa0And --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So no debate necessary, it should just come down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0In the mind of the President, yes, it\'s pretty clear what should happen. \xc2\xa0But the President obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority to make that decision. \xc2\xa0That\'s obviously a decision that will be made by South Carolina officials. \xc2\xa0But the President is very clear about what his views are and what he believes is the appropriate course of action. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So from there, you would say to the people -- to the Governor of South Carolina, take that flag down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President said that seven or eight years ago when he was first asked about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President intend to go to Charleston this week, or at any point soon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do know that many of the families continue to be in the process of organizing memorial services and ways to honor the memory of their loved ones who were lost. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any scheduling announcements at this point for the President, but as more information about his schedule gets locked down we\'ll let you know. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A currency question. \xc2\xa0The former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, has reacted with short of outrage at the decision to replace Alexander Hamilton with a woman on the $10 bill, suggested a better selection would be replacing Andy Jackson on the $20 bill. \xc2\xa0Does the President have a view on that? And would the administration reconsider selecting the $10 bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the Treasury Department has been pretty clear about this. \xc2\xa0The first is that the image of Alexander Hamilton will remain on the $10 -- it\'s that they want to include a woman on the currency. \xc2\xa0And so how exactly that will be done is the process that the Treasury Department is currently engaged in.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that the Treasury Department has selected the $10 bill is the $10 bill is currently the one that is under review by the appropriate authorities for upgraded redesign for security purposes, so it\xe2\x80\x99s the appropriate time to be considering changes like this. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this discussion is happening in the context of the $10 bill. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMatt. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Guest appearance, I guess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Indeed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good. \xc2\xa0Welcome back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Back on Charleston. \xc2\xa0In the aftermath of the mass shooting there, the President has lamented about the politics of Washington blocking any kind of gun control legislation. \xc2\xa0And some have interpreted that to mean that he\xe2\x80\x99s basically giving up on making any efforts on that issue. \xc2\xa0Is that the case, in fact? \xc2\xa0Or is there a chance that the President might try to revisit this before the end of his term?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That conclusion is wrong. \xc2\xa0And I think it is pretty evident from the President\xe2\x80\x99s words and his body language not just when he spoke at this podium on Thursday but in remarks that he delivered over the course of his trip to the West Coast this week that this is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s passionate about. \xc2\xa0And for a good reason. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President is also realistic about is that Congress has had the opportunity to be heard on this and the view right now -- and I think this is a pretty straightforward political analysis -- is that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that Congress is going to act in the way that the President certainly believes would be in the best interest of the country on this issue. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that the only way this will change is when the American people make clear not just what their position is on this issue, but that their position on this issue is a priority and that they would like to see there members of Congress take action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of the polling data indicates that the American people support common-sense steps that would make it much harder for criminals, those with mental health issue -- that there are some common-sense steps that we can take to make it much harder for those individuals to get their hands on a weapon, and that we can do that without undermining the fundamental Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis should be a pretty common-sense endeavor. \xc2\xa0But because of the politics and because of the passion that is felt by a minority of individuals across the country, those steps have not been enacted by the Congress. \xc2\xa0And the President was pretty blunt about this analysis in the remarks that he delivered in the Rose Garden a couple of years ago after the last attempt to enact legislation along these lines failed in the Senate. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment about that continues and it continues to be evident. \xc2\xa0But it certainly is not an indication and should not be misread as the President somehow losing passion for this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0A U.N. investigation concluded that in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Gaza War, Israel and Palestinian militant groups committed serious violations of international humanitarian law that may have amounted to war crimes. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to that report, especially given that it impugns the actions of one of its closest allies in the region?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Matt, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to review the report that was released over the weekend, I believe. \xc2\xa0We indicated last year in the midst of this conflict that we support Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to self-defense, and at the same time, we expressed deep concern about those civilians in Gaza that were in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. \xc2\xa0And we urged all parties to do everything that they could to protect innocent civilians who are essentially caught in the crossfire of this conflict. \xc2\xa0That was an important thing to do particularly given the high civilian death toll in Gaza.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re also aware that Israel has undertaken an investigation of incidents from the conflict, and we await further outcomes from the Israeli government on this particular matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Going back to the WTF interview. \xc2\xa0Did the President intend to say what he did? \xc2\xa0I mean, obviously it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mistake, but what I mean, did he go into the interview intending to use that word?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I mean, as was evident from the conversation, it was a free-flowing conversation and it was pretty wide-ranging, and there was no decision made on the part of anybody here at the White House that we were going to capitalize on this audio interview from somebody\xe2\x80\x99s garage in California -- that this would be an opportune time for him to get this particular point off his chest.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, I think the point that he\xe2\x80\x99s making is entirely consistent with the way that he has made this point both in settings where he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering from prepared remarks, but also when he\xe2\x80\x99s answering -- in the context of answering other questions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he have any hesitancy in using that? \xc2\xa0I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard him use that word in the public before, even before he was President, have we? \xc2\xa0Or has he? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. \xc2\xa0I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President has never used it before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that that word is mentioned in his -- in Dreams from My Father, his book, several times. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him use the word before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And he was pretty forceful here in this room talking about the issue of guns. \xc2\xa0Is there any indication -- when he made those remarks did he have any indication that the shooting in Charleston would have been prevented by any of the proposals that he has made on gun control?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, Jon. \xc2\xa0We are obviously in the very early hours of what was an ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0That is an investigation that continues to this hour as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point that the President is making is that we all know there are some common-sense steps that can be taken that don\xe2\x80\x99t undermine critically important Second Amendment rights but would make our country safer, would make our kids a little safer, and would make it harder for criminals and those with mental problems to get their hands on a weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is no piece of legislation that Congress can pass and the President can sign into law that will eliminate every instant of gun violence in this country. \xc2\xa0But if there is legislation that Congress can pass that would even slightly reduce the number of incidence of gun violence in this country, then why on Earth wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they sign it? \xc2\xa0Then why on Earth wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they pass it so that the President can sign it? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He sure seemed to be giving the impression that this was a result of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s inability to act. \xc2\xa0I mean, he came -- in the heat of that moment --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that is true that there are incidence of gun violence that would --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- that would be prevented if Congress were to act, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say what impact any sort of congressional legislation would have had on this particular incident. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And I\'m sorry, one more question on the interview. \xc2\xa0What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to see his own words bleeped out? \xc2\xa0I mean, this is a word that most networks simply will not air because it\xe2\x80\x99s so offensive. \xc2\xa0What does the President think when he hears his own words bleeped out? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him about that specific issue. \xc2\xa0I will say that it strikes me as the kind of editorial decision that all of you have to make and not one that I\xe2\x80\x99d weigh in on from here at least.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Michelle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go along the same lines. \xc2\xa0Why did the President choose to use that word in this context?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, there is no -- the President did not set out to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But he made the choice during the interview and surely that\xe2\x80\x99s come out in the discussion and analysis that you do after, I would assume, every interview. \xc2\xa0But this one in particular caused a stir. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s such a charged word, and to use it right now in this setting, he had to have known that this was going to get a reaction. \xc2\xa0Right? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was surprised by that, but I do think that it has prompted careful consideration of what exactly he said. \xc2\xa0And as I think I said to Jon, this is consistent with an argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in the past, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an argument that people are now being exposed to today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the discussion that -- you said you did have a discussion, just not about a particular point that Jon made.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0About the editing of -- not the editing, but the censoring of his word.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So in the discussion that you did have, why did he choose at that moment to use that word? \xc2\xa0You said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going into the interview to use it. \xc2\xa0But at that moment, did he say he decided to, I guess, go there, as a way of saying it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the nature of the discussion I had with him. \xc2\xa0I think the fact of the matter is that if you take a look at the context of this exchange that he had with the interviewer, the President is making an argument that is familiar to many of you who have carefully covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of these issues over the last year or so. \xc2\xa0This is quite similar to the argument that the President actually made at the foot of the steps -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, at the foot of the Edmund Petus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe talked about how the progress that we have made on racial issues in this country, since that fateful day 50 years ago -- or a little over 50 years ago now -- is remarkable and undeniable. \xc2\xa0And we owe a debt of gratitude to people like John Lewis for the enormous sacrifices that they have made. \xc2\xa0And we should take a lot of satisfaction and pride, and even inspiration, from the fact that because of their dedication and their incredible courage, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress in this country. \xc2\xa0And the first thing that John Lewis would tell you, and the thing that the President observed in his remarks in that speech, was that John Lewis didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it alone; that he felt he had the strong support of the community there in Selma, Alabama, and Americans of a variety of religions and a variety of races who came to stand with him and to march with him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd because of that unified commitment to a principle of justice and equality and fairness, we have made important progress and should draw on the inspiration and success of those previous efforts to make additional progress in this country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the argument that the President was seeking to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, by using that word, would you say that he had a goal in dropping that word, making the decision at that moment to say the \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x9d word? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t even feel like I feel comfortable saying it out loud in the briefing room. \xc2\xa0So for him to say it during this interview, was it the garage setting that -- (laughter) -- I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he would say it -- I mean, he chose not to say it in the briefing room, during a very emotional address.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, in an entirely different context, though -- when he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking essentially to the nation, on live television, in the aftermath of a horrific incident of violence here in the briefing room is very different than a taped audio interview in a garage. \xc2\xa0So I think we can all acknowledge that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case. \xc2\xa0It also was a different kind of discussion that the President was seeking to have at that point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you say that he had a goal in choosing to use that word at the moment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I would just observe is that the argument that the President has made in the context of this specific interview is consistent with an argument that he has made in a variety of other settings, both when he\xe2\x80\x99s been asked questions but also when he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering prepared remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I would acknowledge that it is understandably notable that the President chose to use this word. \xc2\xa0But the argument that the President is making is one that is familiar to those who have been listening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A provocative choice, though, yes? \xc2\xa0I mean, he had to have known that -- as he makes the decision to say the word, and the word comes out of his mouth, he had to have known that he was deliberately saying something provocative.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xc2\xa0He said it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of it being polite -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of it not being polite\xe2\x80\x9d to say that word in public. \xc2\xa0So, yes, I think that is self-evident from the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today, the EU voted to extend sanctions for another six months against Russia -- punitive action for their annexation of Crimea and for their support of separatists in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0Is the United States going along with that? \xc2\xa0Do you have any comment from there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0JC, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that this is something that the President discussed with the G7 allies -- or our G7 partners in Germany earlier this month. \xc2\xa0And this was an opportunity for the President to have detailed conversations with President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, in particular, about how important it is for the international community to remain unified in the face of the destabilizing actions of President Putin. \xc2\xa0And this is the next step as the international community continues to act together in the face of the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And I think it is an indication of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s resolve to making sure that President Putin respects basic international norms.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple on Iran. \xc2\xa0The Foreign Minister said today that it\xe2\x80\x99s more important to get a good deal than it is to adhere to a deadline of June 30th. \xc2\xa0Is that something the administration agrees with?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the way that we have described it, Major, is that the President will not sign on to a bad deal. \xc2\xa0So the extent that the Prime Minister -- or the Foreign Minister is indicating that a good deal is paramount, I think from that respect the administration would agree. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly entirely possible that what --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will it take more days, other than the seven remaining between now and the 30th, to get one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Major, what we have been saying for a month or so now is that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, I know. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything new.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, there\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, also, as he came back to work last week -- and we haven\'t had a chance to bring this up publicly -- Secretary of State Kerry said it really isn\xe2\x80\x99t important any longer to achieve a deal with Iran that it need to disclose fully its previous attempts militarily to obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0From this podium, you and others have said that at a certain time it was very important and that Iran would have to make clear what it attempted to do, and the world would have to understand all the efforts it undertook to pursue one. \xc2\xa0Now, that appears, by the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s own words, to be off the table. \xc2\xa0That appears to be a significant concession. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we have been saying all along, Major, is that we would insist that Iran address the significant concerns that the international community has had with the potential military dimensions of their nuclear program, but also to make sure that moving forward every path that Iran has to a nuclear weapon has been cut off. \xc2\xa0And that will require Iran to cooperate with --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more room for Iran to admit less than it would prefer.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, we have been clear about what our expectations are, and that actually is something that is discussed in political agreement that was reached in early April. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- we will expect -- in fact, we will insist that Iran address those concerns and, most importantly, however, that they verify their compliance with an agreement that shuts down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the Wall Street Journal reported today that there are lots of emails that indicate that Jonathan Gruber played a far more significant advisory and policymaking role in the development of the Affordable Care Act than had been previously admitted by this administration. \xc2\xa0Lots of emails with Zeke and Jason Furman and other people who were central to the development of the legislative framework of the law -- that appears to be in contradiction from what the administration described originally. \xc2\xa0Would you like to amend that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think our description of his role in this has been consistent. \xc2\xa0He did not work at the White House. \xc2\xa0And as far as I can tell, the Wall Street Journal didn\xe2\x80\x99t uncover any emails that suggested that somehow marketplaces established by states would somehow mean the citizens of that state would be ineligible for tax credits. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I recognize these are emails that were actively leaked by Republicans in the House, Republicans who voted more than 50 times to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0So again, this is consistent with the kind of game-playing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans in Congress. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually lower health care costs or expand access to health care for --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know you find fault with the source of them and the motivations behind them. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to ask you to address what they actually appear to represent, which is a more active and engaged role for the person who was previously described to us as largely, if not entirely, tangential to the development of the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, again, when the President was describing this --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would reasonable people not look at these emails and come to a different conclusion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that many reasonable people have combed through 20,000 emails sent by Mr. Gruber in the last six or eight years. \xc2\xa0But maybe there are some that have. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the point is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is anything that is revealed by these emails that is at all surprising to anybody who works here. \xc2\xa0And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the way that his role has been previously described by the administration, at least as far as I know, based on the way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described it and based on the way the President has described it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, there may be some Republicans in Congress who think that releasing these emails gives them some kind of political advantage of one sort or another, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure what that is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Last question, and it\xe2\x80\x99s about the podcast. \xc2\xa0The President -- as a lot of us who spend a lot of time covering him know and appreciate -- is a student of the language. \xc2\xa0He takes words very carefully. \xc2\xa0He crafts many of them himself on speeches and utterances that he considers to be highly valuable. \xc2\xa0Philosophically, did he believe he needed to say something in a more provocative way in order to drive a point that he thinks had been previously missed in his earlier references to race, which, as you said, is consistent? \xc2\xa0But do you feel he needed to use something that would grab the country\xe2\x80\x99s attention in a more provocative way? \xc2\xa0And if so, does he therefore believe that the use of this word has, at certain moments, an arresting and provocative value to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Major, I think that the President was merely answering a question in a pretty informal setting. \xc2\xa0And yes, I would acknowledge that the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- that the way that the President designed his argument in this scenario is more provocative. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody here that\xe2\x80\x99s surprised that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s getting a little bit more attention. \xc2\xa0But when I say it is something, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to an argument that the President had made on many occasions. \xc2\xa0And I recognize that that\xe2\x80\x99s an argument that not everybody likes, but it is an argument that the President feels strong about. \xc2\xa0And this idea that we can draw on the inspiration of those who have allowed this country to make so much progress is something that inspires the President when he considers these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99ve helpfully let us know the President has no regrets, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any contrition about using this particularly inflammatory word. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if he thought it was necessary to get the country\xe2\x80\x99s attention to something he thought it had missed before.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think that the President is not surprised by the reaction but, again, is eager for people to have a good sense of the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make, which is why we have gone to great lengths to try to make sure that all of you in this room exactly understand the argument the President is trying to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrancesca.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Back on the gun violence issue, over the weekend White House Senior Advisor, Valerie Jarrett, she tweeted and she echoed the President and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we to accept this as the new normal? \xc2\xa0If not better laws, what will change this? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your plan to make sure these horrific tragedies end?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Which begs the question -- what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s plan? The President has acknowledged that lawmakers are probably not going to address this issue anytime soon, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also said that until we move public opinion, the lawmakers aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to address it. \xc2\xa0So I guess, again, what is the plan? \xc2\xa0And what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s plan to move up public opinion on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Francesca, you\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously heard the President talk about this a lot over the last several days. \xc2\xa0And this is an issue the President is going to continue talking about. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, a little over a year ago -- a year and a half ago, I guess now -- the administration did announce a couple of dozen executive actions that the President and his administration could take to, in a common-sense way, try to address the root causes of gun violence and to confront those in a way that does not at all undermine the legitimate and important Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible for us to do more, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require \xc2\xa0-- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cus,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean Congress, principally, because there are some common-sense things that Congress can do. \xc2\xa0But periodically, if there are additional ideas from the administration, we won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to put those forward either. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think, again, based on the fact that over the last year and a half, two years or so, the administration has moved forward on more than two dozen different initiatives to try to get at these root causes of gun violence I think is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to try to make progress on this issue. \xc2\xa0But one really important way we could make progress will require congressional action, and that congressional action is something that will only occur once the American public makes clear that that action is a priority. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But should we expect, I guess, any legislative push from the White House, or any sort of new proposals moving forward besides that ones that you just stated?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are some common-sense ones that have already been put on the table and we know would make a difference. \xc2\xa0We know they have the strong support of Americans across the country. \xc2\xa0The President even observed that some of these proposals even have the strong support of a majority of gun owners in this country. \xc2\xa0So the case before the Congress is very clear, but ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Congress to decide to act.</p>\n<p>\n\tTamara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0NPR has an investigation that came out today that shows that the U.S. government conducted chemical weapons experiments, specifically on minorities, to try to figure out if they reacted differently to mustard gas. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re wondering if the White House was aware of these military experiments that happened during World War II, and if the President or the White House plans to do anything to acknowledge what was done to these servicemembers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tamara, I did have an opportunity to hear the report this morning. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that I had heard some of those details. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the Department of Defense was included in that report, and they made clear that the Department of Defense does not conduct chemical weapons testing any longer. \xc2\xa0And I do think that -- as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about these issues, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that the United States military, in relatively recent American history, has played a really important role in helping our country make progress on issues of race. \xc2\xa0Desegregating the military was an important step in this country\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, there\xe2\x80\x99s also a very good reason that the kind of testing that\xe2\x80\x99s described in your report is no longer conducted by the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And will the White House or the President do anything to acknowledge the living veterans who were the subjects of these tests?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any presidential activities to tell you about right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on Matt\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0Why are you going to wait for an Israeli internal report where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to investigate themselves, and you dismiss a U.N. report that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about gross human rights violations, especially that they condemn both sides?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Nadia, the position of the United States government is one that has been quite clear, dating all the way back to last summer, in which we raised significant concerns about the safety and wellbeing of civilians who are caught in the crossfire. \xc2\xa0And those were concerns that we made clear publicly. \xc2\xa0And we raised significant concerns, in particular, about extremists actually using arms to try to target innocent civilians, and we raised concerns about reports that extremists were encouraging civilians to go to places where they could be in even more danger.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we also reiterated our view that it was important for leaders on both sides of the conflict to go to great lengths to try to protect the safety and wellbeing of innocent civilians. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s been our view from the earliest days of this latest conflict, and it is our view today on the day that this U.N. report is released.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until we hear from the Israelis to make an official comment on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect a significantly different official U.S. comment beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, which is consistent with what we said even last summer. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one thing about Israel, too. \xc2\xa0The President came under attack by many Israeli officials, including the former ambassador to Washington, who accused him of formulating his policies in the Middle East because of his, what you call, his Muslim connection -- referring to his father and his stepfather. What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that? \xc2\xa0And also a former Israeli official made a racist remark against the President on Twitter, and she was forced to delete. \xc2\xa0Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a slap in the face to the administration, considering the amount of support you give to Israel militarily and politically and diplomatically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think in the case of Ambassador Oren, I think it\'s pretty clear we\'re just talking about another politician trying to sell books. \xc2\xa0So I\'m not particularly concerned about that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the other comments, I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing we\'ve certainly learned from this incident -- it\'s not the only time we\'ve learned this -- but that on Twitter you\'re limited to 140 characters, but it still has a capacity to be quite revealing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to go back to the issue of guns and just be very clear about what you were just saying. \xc2\xa0Will we see this President either renew the push for the legislation that you talked about that has bipartisan support, extended background checks, for example, or start a new legislative push to try to crack down, have stiffer gun laws in the wake of this shooting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kristen, the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this have not changed. \xc2\xa0This is a view that closing the gun show loophole on background checks, for example, is a policy position the President has long advocated. \xc2\xa0And the President has long called on Congress to take action, and we\'ve been disappointed that they haven\'t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He has. \xc2\xa0But in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, obviously there was a real effort to get it passed. \xc2\xa0He was out campaigning for it. \xc2\xa0Quite frankly, he talked about it in his State of the Union address. \xc2\xa0He said they deserve a vote. \xc2\xa0Will we see that type of robust effort from this White House, from this President before he leaves office to enact stiffer gun laws?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kristen, what the President made clear in the aftermath of the failure of that particular initiative was that we were not likely to see a different outcome in Congress until the American people made clear that this issue was a priority for them. \xc2\xa0There is a small, but very focal minority of the U.S. public who\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that they consider this a priority, but they\xe2\x80\x99re on a different side of the issue than the vast majority of Americans. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re even on a different side of the issue than, according to some polls, a majority of gun owners. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has been very direct about the fact that we\'re not going to see the kind of progress that we would like to make in Congress at least until the American public makes clear to Congress that their views on this topic are a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so what does he mean when he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m not resigned on this issue\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0We saw him come out and say that this weekend. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m not resigned.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And yet it sounds like what you\'re telling me is he\xe2\x80\x99s resigned at least on the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to see anything get through Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, I don\'t think the President is resigned to that. \xc2\xa0I think the President is suggesting that we need the American public to come forward. \xc2\xa0And it will be the American public sending a signal to Congress that this is a priority that will bring about the kind of policy changes that we would like to see. \xc2\xa0I think that is a simple statement of fact. \xc2\xa0But there are some who suggested that the President was resigned we weren\'t going to be able to make any progress on this issue, and that\'s certainly is a bad misreading of both the President\xe2\x80\x99s record and his intentions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I want to ask you a variation on the question you\xe2\x80\x99ve already gotten, so apologies in advance. \xc2\xa0But I spoke with Michael Eric Dyson and he said he thought the President used the \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d word to shock people into awareness, a heightened sense of awareness about racism. \xc2\xa0So did President Obama use the \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d word to shock people into a heightened sense of awareness about racism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President was merely making an argument in an informal setting that\'s entirely consistent with an argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s made before. \xc2\xa0And there is no denying the important progress that we\'ve made in this country when it comes to race relations and making our country more fair and more just, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President, from a personal standpoint, draws great inspiration from the progress that we\'ve already made and from the efforts of a previous generation of civil rights leaders to try to move this country forward. \xc2\xa0And he believes that everybody in this country can draw on that inspiration to try to move the country forward, because as the President acknowledged both in his speech in Selma and in some of his remarks over the last several days, that it\'s going to require the country to come together to confront this particular challenge. \xc2\xa0But we\'ve done it before and hopefully we\'re going to keep doing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0More broadly, on the issue of race, when you look at the statistics, African Americans incarcerated at higher rates, the unemployment rate is far higher than the national average -- does the President feel as though it\xe2\x80\x99s at a breaking point or that he\xe2\x80\x99s fed up with the state of race relations, and that\'s why he is using this new, starker, more blunt language?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, that\'s not the way I would describe the President. \xc2\xa0Again, the way that you should describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this is to go back and look at his comments. The President was saying that we\'ve made really important progress in this country and that anybody who lived through the \xe2\x80\x9850s, \xe2\x80\x9860s, and \xe2\x80\x9870s, not just in the South, but anywhere in the country, would acknowledge that we\'ve made really important progress. \xc2\xa0And we can\'t allow the difficulty and the challenge of making progress on these issues interfere with our passion for them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President made this observation in his remarks in Selma, which is that the kinds of barriers to change that John Lewis and Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders of the \xe2\x80\x9850s and \xe2\x80\x9860\xe2\x80\x99s encountered was significant. \xc2\xa0There were -- you saw entrenched, powerful local leaders -- in some cases, local law enforcement leaders, and this was the case in Selma -- that were willing to resort to violence to try to prevent this kind of change from occurring.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe kind of challenge that we face now is much different than that. \xc2\xa0And we should draw on the courage that that previous era of civil rights leaders showed to inspire some confidence that we can confront these difficult challenges too. \xc2\xa0The challenges are different, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we\'ve made enormous progress and the work that we have to do is so important that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have our passion for these issues diminished just because making progress on them is hard. \xc2\xa0If anything, we should draw on the success that previous generations have made to inspire our confidence in our ability as a country to make progress on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any update on the timing of the hostage review -- now that we\'re officially in summer?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any update on the timing other than I think I previously said that you could expect some news on this relatively soon. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that you can expect some news on this very soon. \xc2\xa0Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0Would it be unfair to describe you as beings somewhat dismissive of the Gruber story and the fact that there were 20,000 emails out there showing that he was very much involved in the development of the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess what I would say, Kevin, is you could probably describe my reaction as a little bemused about why it matters. \xc2\xa0His role, as illuminated in 20,000 emails, is consistent with the way that at least I described his role and with the way that the President has described his role, which is to say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t work at the White House. \xc2\xa0He certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any emails that suggested that citizens who live in states that built their own exchanges should somehow be ineligible for tax credits that make their health insurance more affordable. \xc2\xa0So if there\xe2\x80\x99s a bombshell that\'s included in those emails, it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone off. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to follow up on something a lot of people have been talking about and that\'s the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d word. \xc2\xa0Does the President condone the use of that word at home? \xc2\xa0And what would he say to parents who work very hard to get their children to not use it even though it\'s out there, it\'s in music, especially in urban settings -- the parents who\xe2\x80\x99ve said don\'t ever use that word even casually -- what does he say to those parents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d probably have to ask him that. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\'s an illegitimate question. It just means I think that for the President\xe2\x80\x99s own personal views you should ask him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bring him out.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bring him out. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ll see. \xc2\xa0I\'ll ask him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Or we\'ll go in. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\'ll be happy to all go in there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There you go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, on guns. \xc2\xa0I know he tried to make the point that he understands there\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition of families who have had gun ownership and there\xe2\x80\x99s bonding that goes along with that, but at the same time, he\xe2\x80\x99s tried to make the point repeatedly, after, unfortunately, so many of the tragedies, that there should be something we can do, whether legislatively or organically among the American people. \xc2\xa0But I\'m wondering if the timing sometimes gets in the way of the message, because often when he\'ll come out he\'ll say something -- it seems to get lost in what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the moment. \xc2\xa0In other words, people are still grieving over what happened in Charleston and he comes right out and he starts talking about gun control. \xc2\xa0Can you understand how that can sometimes put off people who are trying to get through the moment before they can set it aside to listen to what he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'ll say a couple things about that, Kevin. \xc2\xa0The first thing I would say is this is an issue that the President has talked about quite a bit, and he did it a lot in his presidential campaign. \xc2\xa0When the President was campaigning -- and many of you were around to cover this -- the President would go and do town hall meetings in many small communities in rural Iowa where he was campaigning for the Democratic nomination. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is -- we\'re talking about eight years ago now where the President would be asked about this issue. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99d be asked about this issue by Democratic caucus-goers who were very concerned about making sure their Second Amendment rights were protected. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99d make a case to the President about how important it is in their family, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a family tradition related to hunting, and that handing down firearms from one generation to another is important to their family and entirely consistent with the constitutional rights that the Constitution guarantees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President indicated his strong support for that, that he understood both that perspective and understood why that needed to be a priority. \xc2\xa0The President also heard from those who said things to him like, when you live in a small town or out in the country, local law enforcement can be quite a ways away, and the desire to have a firearm in that kind of setting is a perfectly reasonable one and, again, entirely consistent with protected constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is not the first time that the President has been exposed to these kinds of arguments, and it\'s certainly not the first time that the President has indicated his support for those kinds of arguments that are made. \xc2\xa0But in those settings, the President would also point out that in an urban setting, for example, or at least in an area that\'s more densely populated, that there are different factors that are involved, and that even in the kinds of settings that are being described there in a more rural community there are still some common-sense things that we can do. \xc2\xa0For example, closing the background check loophole at gun shows -- that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t infringe significantly on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat we can ban assault weapons. \xc2\xa0You don\'t need an assault weapon to go hunting. \xc2\xa0That certainly is not part of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s family heritage or family tradition. \xc2\xa0And so these are the kinds of arguments that the President has been making for some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI did not work for him when he campaigned for the United States Senate in Illinois, but I assumed he had exactly those kinds of conversations that I just described to Iowa caucus-goers with potential Illinois voters when he was running for the Senate in 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the timing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess the point is this is an argument that the President has made not just in reaction to terrible tragic events like the one we saw last week in Charleston, but this is an argument that the President has made when he\xe2\x80\x99s campaigning. \xc2\xa0It\'s one that he\xe2\x80\x99s made as a candidate. \xc2\xa0It\'s one he\xe2\x80\x99s made as an officeholder. \xc2\xa0It\'s one that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in the context of a State of the Union address. \xc2\xa0It\'s a conversation that he\xe2\x80\x99s had in the context of a podcast interview in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s garage. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s had it in a variety of settings, in a variety of circumstances, and on a variety of occasions over the last eight years. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is indicative of the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion for these issues. \xc2\xa0But one thing is clear is that more members of Congress are going to have to share the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion before we can make progress in closing the gun show loophole. \xc2\xa0And the way that we\'re going to inspire that passion is for more American citizens across the country to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry, I must have spaced out a little bit. \xc2\xa0I missed what you told Major about the deadline on the Iran nuclear deal. \xc2\xa0Is that a notional deadline, or are you sticking to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We are sticking to the deadline. \xc2\xa0The deadline is June 30th. \xc2\xa0At the same time, we\'ve acknowledged that the previous deadline for the conclusion of the political negotiations was March 31st. \xc2\xa0Nothing was announced until April 2nd.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the deadline is firm, but these kinds of short-term adjustments may be required in order to complete an agreement. \xc2\xa0But at this point, we continue to believe that -- we\'re continuing to operate with a June 30th deadline.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m curious about how the podcast interview came about. \xc2\xa0I know the White House approached Mr. Maron. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering what segment of the American public was being targeted specifically through his podcast versus other media outlets, and whether the President had ever heard of the WTF podcast before he went on the show. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him about it. \xc2\xa0I think he had heard of it, even if he hadn\'t heard it -- if that makes sense. \xc2\xa0And again, the idea here is not just that Mr. Maron presumably has a unique audience, one that\'s probably much bigger today than it has been in the past -- (laughter) -- thanks to all of you. \xc2\xa0But also this is a unique setting. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t just mean that it\'s a place in Mr. Maron\xe2\x80\x99s garage, but that this was an open-ended, free-flowing, pretty casual hour-long conversation with the President on a wide variety of issues; that there was no one topic that was covered, there were a variety of topics that were covered. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the combination of those factors made this a unique opportunity, and I wouldn\'t rule out doing other things like it in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a garage, but I\'ve got a parking space. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Is it covered?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Actually, it is. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s cars on either side of it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Josh, can you fill in the blank in the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule between the PDB this morning and the Iftar dinner tonight? \xc2\xa0We don\'t know anything else that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that the President has had a number of meetings with staff and I certainly wouldn\'t rule out conversations with members of Congress about the series of votes on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trade priority that\'s scheduled for this week. I don\'t have any individual calls to tell you about, but I do think the President will be engaged in that effort. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0First, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley\xe2\x80\x99s office announced that at 4:00 p.m. she would make a statement calling for removal of the Confederate battle flag from its location. \xc2\xa0Any reaction? \xc2\xa0Or can you get us a reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ll see what she has to say first and then we\'ll either react right away or maybe we can discuss it here tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0The other thing is that over the weekend, Ohio Governor John Kasich became the first of the Republican presidential hopefuls to address the growing Greek default crisis, and specifically the scenario of Russia possibly bailing out Greece or Greece seeking aid from Russia. \xc2\xa0He said, and I quote, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very ugly scenario,\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s something he said we should guard against and not pursue. \xc2\xa0Does the administration have any position on Greece turning to Russia for its next loan or a bailout?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the fact is, John, the two countries you\xe2\x80\x99re discussing are not exactly countries whose economies are operating at peak levels right now. \xc2\xa0So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the concern that you hear expressed about this from the administration will at least be moderated. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you as a general matter is that we continue to believe that now is the time for Greece and their partners to reach an agreement after months of difficult negotiations. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest for a way forward to be found that will allow Greece to successfully return to stability and growth while continuing to make progress in implementing important reforms to put its public finances back on a sustainable path. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States, principally through Secretary Lew, continues to be engaged with all of the partners. \xc2\xa0But ultimately we are hopeful that Greece and its partners will seize this opportunity, now that we\xe2\x80\x99re so close to the deadline, to complete the negotiations and move forward that\xe2\x80\x99s in the collective interest of all of those sitting around the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So nothing on Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nothing on Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, not a 2016 question but a reaction to things that current and former officeholders have been saying, some --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me just observe that when people say it\xe2\x80\x99s not a 2016 question, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually a 2016 question. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. \xc2\xa0That\'s entirely okay. \xc2\xa0I will accept it in the spirit in which it\xe2\x80\x99s offered. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, I appreciate that. \xc2\xa0I hope you find it will. \xc2\xa0There are some who have described what\xe2\x80\x99s happened as South Carolina putting race second or lower in a priority, and saying this, first and foremost, was an attack on religion or an attack on faith. \xc2\xa0The President in describing it has put race where I think -- put race first. \xc2\xa0He said that this is a racial issue. Irrespective of the ongoing investigation and a lot of other questions that are still open, what do you make of, and what does the President make of those who are putting race second or lower in the priorities when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the motives behind this attack and also the aftermath?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jared, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any of the specific comments that you may be referring to. \xc2\xa0I think what --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because you\xe2\x80\x99re not paying attention to the 2016 race? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m paying a little attention to it. \xc2\xa0I think I would just say that I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s observation about what appears to be the motive of this individual is the observation that the vast majority of Americans have reached. \xc2\xa0But, at the same time, there is an ongoing federal investigation so the President noted in his comments on Thursday I believe that he needed to be a little restrained in making remarks about the alleged suspect, so I need to do the same, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the American people need to change, that to move the needle on this it needs to be public opinion. \xc2\xa0What can we expect on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, or what changes to his message or his road trips? \xc2\xa0Will we be seeing him actively do this? \xc2\xa0When you\xe2\x80\x99re describing it, obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s not resigned to this, but the language you\xe2\x80\x99ve been using today is very passive -- the American people need this to happen. \xc2\xa0What actively can we see from the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would quibble with that description. \xc2\xa0I think the President has been very forward-leaning about why this is a priority and why this is something that he is passionate about -- and particularly in light of the fact that there are some common-sense steps that Congress can take that would make our kids and our communities more safe without undermining the fundamental Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the Congress is coming from one angle, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s role is what? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, my question was about what will the President do and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the President will continue to do is forcefully make the case, as he has in recent days, that this needs to be a priority. \xc2\xa0And he will note that there are some common-sense things that can be done that will make our community safer, that will reduce incidents of gun violence without undermining the fundamental constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This needs to be a priority and the President has made it clear that it is a priority for him. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is what will he do or say differently in the next year and a half that is going to try to move the needle here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President is going to continue to make a very forceful, persuasive case to the public.</p>\n<p>\n\tFred, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0A couple things. \xc2\xa0First of all, the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Encyclical last week on climate change. \xc2\xa0One small part of that in a very large document, the Pope wrote that concern for protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification for abortion. \xc2\xa0Is it safe to say the President strongly disagrees with that portion of the Encyclical?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Fred, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually see that portion of it, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a look at the document and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And also with regard to the earlier questions about whether there could be any laws that might have prevented this, there are background checks in place in South Carolina right now. \xc2\xa0Would the President -- well, the bill that he supported previously, the Toomey-Manchin legislation, actually made an exemption for transfers of family members on these weapons. \xc2\xa0Would the President support background checks for transfers, which would have maybe prevented what happened in Charleston?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Fred, the reason that the President has continued to forcefully encourage Congress to take some common-sense steps to reduce gun violence is not with the idea that one piece of legislation can prevent every incident of gun violence. The fact is this particular incident is still under investigation and so until we know more about what exactly has happened or what did happen in this instance, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say whether one piece of legislation or one rule, if changed, could have prevented this particular action. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is, as the President pointed out, that more than 11,000 Americans died in 2013 from gun violence. \xc2\xa0And if there is a simple thing that can be done that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine our constitutional rights, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, but would lower that number, then we should do it. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Congress \xc2\xa0-- that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has made a persuasive and forceful case to Congress that they should take action.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0Enjoy the rest of your day.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:03 P.M.
