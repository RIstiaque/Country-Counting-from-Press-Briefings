EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So before we get started, I just want to give you a sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities are today.\xc2\xa0 I think many of you dialed into the call last night and have a good sense of what the plans are.\xc2\xa0 This morning, the President and First Lady are traveling to Fort Stewart, which is home to the United States Army\xe2\x80\x99s 3rd Infantry Division and one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s premier military units, which has deployed numerous times to Iraq in support of operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn.\xc2\xa0 And currently has elements supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tFort Stewart has been a leader across the military by providing extensive educational counseling in order to protect its service members against the aggressive and deceptive recruiting, serving as a model for other bases.\xc2\xa0 In 2011, more than 4,800 soldiers at this army post took over 15,000 college classes using Department of Defense tuition assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President and the First Lady both talk about the sacred trust that the people of the United States have with our men and women in uniform and their families.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, part of that sacred trust is a responsibility to protect them from overly aggressive and deceptive trade practices.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the executive order that the President will sign sort of under the banner of the \xe2\x80\x9cWe Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait\xe2\x80\x9d campaign, that should be familiar to all of you, will put in place protections for military families from deceptive and aggressive marketing practices, such as ensuring that they provide to servicemembers \xe2\x80\x9cKnow Before You Owe\xe2\x80\x9d financial aid forms.\xc2\xa0 It will also include trademarking of the label the \xe2\x80\x9cGI Bill\xe2\x80\x9d that will prevent unscrupulous educational institutions from misusing that term.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is particularly important and something that\xe2\x80\x99s close to the President\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about how his grandfather benefited from the GI Bill.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Greatest Generation used the benefits associated with the GI Bill to create the strongest and most thriving middle class in the history of the planet.\xc2\xa0 And the President and First Lady remain committed to ensuring that those same opportunities exist for this generation of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that will be what the President will talk about today, both the President and First Lady.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it more eloquently than I just did, so listen carefully.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up for questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2.2 percent quarterly growth.\xc2\xa0 Are there any -- which is below expectations.\xc2\xa0 Are there any concerns about the slowing of the economic recovery?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve even heard me say a few times, Matt, that regardless of where these individual reports come in, in relation to expectations, we don\xe2\x80\x99t put too much weight on any individual report.\xc2\xa0 Rather, what we examine are the longer-term trends.\xc2\xa0 And today\xe2\x80\x99s report indicates that for the eleventh consecutive quarter we\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed economic growth in this country.\xc2\xa0 So for those of you scoring along at home, that\xe2\x80\x99s almost three years of consecutive, economic growth in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction, the President -- while we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction, this report illustrates something that the President has long understood, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit more work to do, both in terms of the putting in place policies that will help the private sector create jobs, but also ensure that we have policies in place that will benefit middle-class families and those families trying to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a couple of aspects of the report that I do want to point out to you, however, that do have some encouraging data.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, personal consumption increased by 2.9 percent; that\xe2\x80\x99s an increase from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter.\xc2\xa0 We also saw residential home construction increase by about 19 percent.\xc2\xa0 So there have been four consecutive quarters of improvement in the residential housing sector.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that that\xe2\x80\x99s happened since 2005.\xc2\xa0 And the auto industry continues to be a source of optimism and strength for this country -- that in this report it actually accounted\xc2\xa0 for 1 percent of GDP growth, just the auto sector alone.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there are some parts of the economy that are functioning pretty strongly, but there\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit more work to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, did the President agree to an interview in the Situation Room in connection with the one-year anniversary of the bin Laden raid?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how is that not a politicization of the Situation Room?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- what I can tell you is that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- has conducted a couple of interviews over the course of the last year about the successful mission against Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 There is, as you would expect and as many of you have demonstrated over the course of the last year, a lot of interest in that mission, how the decision was made to carry out that mission, and what activities were involved in preparing our courageous men and women in uniform to undertake that mission successfully.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President has spoken frequently about how the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the credit for the success of that mission goes to our men and women in uniform, to the men and women in the intelligence community, who worked so hard to ensure that mission\xe2\x80\x99s success.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so what the President did yesterday and what he has done many times before over the course of the last year is talk about that mission and talk about the success of that mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he do so yesterday in the Situation Room?\xc2\xa0 And how was that decision made?\xc2\xa0 Whose idea was it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to talk in detail about interviews that the President has conducted that haven\xe2\x80\x99t aired yet.\xc2\xa0 I would show the same deference to the Associated Press if the Associated Press had conducted an interview that had not yet been published or reported.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there ever been an interview done in the Situation Room before now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it appropriate to be talking about these things in connection with the one-year anniversary in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- (laughter) there certainly is interest around the one-year anniversary, so I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if nobody asked about it in the context of the one-year anniversary.\xc2\xa0 I expect that all of you will be asking about it next week as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason why I ask that is because when it was the anniversary of the health care -- signing of the health care bill, that was dismissed as a hallmark holiday by senior White House officials.\xc2\xa0 And now, when it\xe2\x80\x99s the anniversary of this, there seems to be a lot of interest on the part of the White House in marking it.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good example.\xc2\xa0 In connection with the anniversary of the President\xe2\x80\x99s historic signing of the health care reform legislation, many journalists -- I think understandably -- asked questions about the health care reform legislation, about the success of the health care reform legislation, what it said about the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and his priorities.\xc2\xa0 And I think the same is true of this anniversary as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course he did.\xc2\xa0 The administration talked about it quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 The President put out a video.\xc2\xa0 I know that the campaign talked about it a lot.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talk to us about North Korea and these analysts have determined that these rockets are fake.\xc2\xa0 What has been the determination of the administration?\xc2\xa0 And how do you view this display of fakery?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific intelligence assessment to offer you this morning, Dan.\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports, and national security officials at the White House have seen the reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to those reports.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you is that the failures of the North Korean missile program over the last couple of weeks have been widely observed and well chronicled.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, they are also part of a series of provocative steps and actions and words from the North Korean regime that only serve to further isolate that nation.\xc2\xa0 And certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of the North Korean people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Secret Service investigation, we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing more information coming out on what happened in other countries, on other trips.\xc2\xa0 In light of that, is the White House now reexamining staffers\xe2\x80\x99 activities in other countries aside from Colombia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know Dan, there have been no credible -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there actually have been even any uncredible accusations have been made about the conduct of White House staffers.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that anything has been made.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, are you looking at now that other things are coming out on the Secret Service in other countries, is it a time to then reexamine what may have happened in the past in other countries as well with regard to White House staffers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as Jay mentioned earlier this week, there was a review that was conducted by the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office, solely out of due diligence.\xc2\xa0 Again, even in the case of Colombia, where there were credible allegations raised and concerns raised about the conduct of some members of the Secret Service and some members of the military there, that out of due diligence the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office did conduct a review of the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut those same kinds of -- as I pointed out, no credible allegations or even uncredible allegations have been made about the conduct of White House staffers in other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to report out to you at this time other than, as Secretary Napolitano said earlier this week when she was testifying before Congress, she pointed out there is an ongoing investigation about the conduct of Secret Service agents in Colombia -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s continuing.\xc2\xa0 And she also pointed out that if there were other credible, substantiated allegations that needed to be reviewed, that the Secret Service would stand ready to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I also want to -- feel obligated to reiterate something that the President himself has said a couple of times and something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Jay repeat a couple of times, which is that the men and women of the Secret Service hold themselves to a very high standard.\xc2\xa0 And the overwhelming majority of the men and women of the Secret Service live up to that incredibly high standard on a day to day basis, even as they\xe2\x80\x99re carrying out very important and very dangerous work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the UN Special Envoy has found Syria in violation of the peace agreement there.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the next step in Syria?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response?\xc2\xa0 There are demonstrations planned there later today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd also, is the President aware of the situation in London, where apparently someone is wearing explosive devices and threatening to bomb -- set off a bomb?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that just broke while we were taking off.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to circle back with you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to Syria, we have frequently noted and condemned and mourned the tragic loss of innocent life in that country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the dangerous path that the Assad regime has taken that country down.\xc2\xa0 We are also concerned about the destabilizing effect that that has throughout the entire region.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are pleased that there has been international support for the Kofi Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 And we anticipate -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been disappointed in the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s failure to live up to promises that they made in the context of that plan.\xc2\xa0 So I know that Ambassador Rice, Secretary Clinton have talked about this in recent days, that we intend to continue to ramp up the international pressure against the Assad regime, and encourage them in the strongest possible terms to live up to the obligations and commitments that they made in the context of the Kofi Annan plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to U.S. allies about potentially a Libya-type intervention?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like the peace plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re still making efforts to implement that peace plan.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out to you in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with allies or other world leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the EPA regional official who had made the \xe2\x80\x9ccrucify\xe2\x80\x9d comments -- there have been some calls for him to be removed.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us anything on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot to add beyond what Jay said yesterday, which is that the official in question has apologized for those comments and acknowledged that they do not reflect at all the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy on these kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe truth is better illustrated by the facts of our policies and the impact that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies have had, which is that oil and gas production has increased every single year that President Obama has been in office.\xc2\xa0 Currently, oil production is at an eight-year high.\xc2\xa0 And natural gas production is at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that those specific statistics speak much more about this administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies related to oil and gas production than anything that was said a couple of years ago by an EPA administrator.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say then that those comments have been a liability for the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would say that those comments are not true.\xc2\xa0 And if -- and the person who said them admitted as much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on May 5th, the first official campaign events are on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to ask, what\xe2\x80\x99s changed?\xc2\xa0 What factors come into play that you now call these official campaign events as opposed to anything else that the President has done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, speaking generally, these are events that are organized by the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign, and are geared toward building support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the express purpose of the events, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the campaign will -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign will be doing their part to organize and pay for those events.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Syria just for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton said about a week ago that while she wished the Annan plan well, that it was time for the United States to consider the possibility that it might fail, and that the U.S. and allies might have to take additional measures, possibly including that UN Chapter 7 resolution.\xc2\xa0 A week has gone by.\xc2\xa0 Are you any closer to declaring the Annan program dead and looking for other options instead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot new for you on that, to be candid.\xc2\xa0 This administration has expressed in the strongest personal terms our frustration and disappointment with the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s utter failure to live up to the obligations and commitments that they made with the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 That part is -- their failure to do so is indisputable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is fair to say that certainly Ambassador Rice, certainly Secretary Clinton are actively engaged in working with our international partners and consulting with them to continue to ramp up pressure on the Assad regime to stop the violence against innocent citizens of Syria; and to encourage them and to make it clear to them that they have an obligation to live up to the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody else?\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually one quick thing about that event.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be meeting privately with anybody?\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s some time when we get on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more for you on that when we get on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is on the plane, by the way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Antoinette says yes.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who else is traveling today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for mentioning that.\xc2\xa0 I failed to mention that Holly Petraeus is traveling aboard Air Force One today.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Mrs. Petraeus has taken on a leadership role at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with a special focus on protecting military families and veterans and spouses of our men and women in uniform to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re treated fairly by financial institutions and, in this case, by some educational institutions as well.\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s traveling with the President today because she has a direct role in ensuring that some of these issues that are laid out in the executive order are carried out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any members of Congress, the military?\xc2\xa0 And other White House -- who\xe2\x80\x99s the deputy -- is it Alyssa?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alyssa Mastromonaco is aboard the plane, as is Tina Tchen, who is the First Lady\'s Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I also have a week ahead for you.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- at least I thought I did.\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, here it is.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a not whole lot on here, but a couple of important details to remind you of.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday morning, the President will deliver remarks at the Building and Construction Trades Department Legislative Conference.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And then in the afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister Noda of Japan to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to holding discussions with the Prime Minister on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues, including the U.S.-Japan security alliance, economic and trade issues, and deepening bilateral cooperation.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders will also discuss regional and global security concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President and First Lady will host a Cinco de Mayo reception at the White House, as they\'ve done in previous years.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then on Saturday -- next Saturday -- the President, as Mike pointed out, will travel to Columbus, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia for a couple of campaign events.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of this weekend, the President will -- is obviously giving what I can only assume are highly anticipated remarks at the White House Correspondents\xe2\x80\x99 Dinner on Saturday evening, and then also has a campaign function on Sunday evening in the Washington area.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anticipating that his remarks will go over smashingly, can you tell us who wrote them or who worked on them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As in previous years, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a team effort among the very clever members of the White House speechwriting team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he enjoy it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when you see him deliver the speech he looks like he\'s laughing and having a pretty good time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, does he enjoy the dinner?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he enjoys his own remarks, I get that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But does he enjoy the spectacle, the dinner, the --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that one of the things that the President does appreciate is -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about this, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about this a little bit on Saturday -- that there are people who work at the White House, who cover the White House for major media organizations, who -- well, for media organizations large and small -- who take\xc2\xa0 their job very seriously and fulfill a very important role in our democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to pay tribute to those efforts.\xc2\xa0 But also, I think the President appreciates that he can do so in a setting in which people aren\'t taking themselves too seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the Sunday evening campaign event, is that open press?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the press access for that event will be.\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to work this weekend we could check and see exactly what demands will be on your time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the conference was by the Building and Construction --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Building and Construction Trades.\xc2\xa0 Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:23 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
