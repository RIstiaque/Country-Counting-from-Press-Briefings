Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t4:03 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been a long afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to make sure that before I came out to you I could provide you with as much updated information as possible.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an opening statement to make, and in the interests of moving this along I\'ll go straight to questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can anticipate some of your questions, so it was the kind of information that I hope will be responsive to your questions, at least in part, that I sought and found.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the President and Speaker Boehner discussed in their phone call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can.\xc2\xa0 The President did call and speak with the Speaker of the House this afternoon, not long ago, had a good conversation, and the two of them agreed that all sides need to keep talking on the issues here that are confronting us that have led to a shutdown of the government and to the situation that has put us on the precipice of potential default, or at least reaching that line beyond which the United States government does not have borrowing authority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President believes that in his meetings yesterday with House Republican leaders, and today with Senate Republicans as well as, of course, with House and Senate Democrats, that there have been constructive talks.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the House Republicans, in particular, there is an indication, anyway, of a recognition that we need to remove default as a weapon in budget negotiations, that the threat of default should not be used, and certainly default itself is never an option.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President appreciates the constructive nature of the conversation and of the proposal that House Republicans put forward.\xc2\xa0 He has some concerns with it, and I\'ll simply say that, without reading -- I\'m not going to read out details of conversations or the phone calls, but that our position, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that the United States should not, and the American people cannot, pay a ransom in exchange for Congress doing its job remains as true today as it has been throughout this period.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about a House Republican proposal, are you talking about the proposal that they presented in the meeting yesterday, or are you talking about this new proposal from them that would increase the debt ceiling short term, also reopen the government, and then, in exchange, increasing cuts in benefit programs?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t think -- I\'m not aware of multiple proposals.\xc2\xa0 I think that there has been a general discussion -- and I\'m not going to get into details.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that the President has long believed and has insisted that we cannot allow a situation where one party in one house uses the threat of default to try to extract concessions through budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And it is his position that the right thing to do is to remove that gun from the table, extend the debt ceiling in a way that ensures that there is no suggestion or hint that default is an option, because our economy can\'t endure that kind of approach to resolving our budget differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a proposal that puts a debt ceiling increase at only six weeks tied to budget negotiations would put us right back where we are today in just six weeks, on the verge of Thanksgiving and the obviously important shopping season leading up to the holidays, and that would create enormous uncertainty for our economy.\xc2\xa0 The President, speaking with small business owners, heard from them that the continued threat of default into that season would be very damaging to them.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t think that\'s the right way to go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday, though, that the President would likely sign a short-term debt ceiling increase.\xc2\xa0 That still stands, is that correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s be clear about what his position has been and what I\'ve said.\xc2\xa0 It is the very least that Congress could do to pass the legislation that would raise the debt ceiling for a short term and pass legislation that would fund the government for a short term, as the Senate has already passed.\xc2\xa0 And the President has believed that -- as I think I\'ve stated many times -- we should raise the debt ceiling for longer than that, as the Senate has proposed and will vote on soon, because we should not link the threat of default to budget negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s very eager to engage in budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been something he\xe2\x80\x99s amply demonstrated all year long and is reflected in the budget proposal he made earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 But we should not have a situation -- a dynamic that has led to where we are now, that led to what we saw in the summer of 2011, and that would be recreated in six weeks if we had to once again go through a process where one party was trying to extract concessions and budget negotiations in return for lifting the debt ceiling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to try one more time.\xc2\xa0 There was a proposal that the House Republicans came to the White House with yesterday for their meeting.\xc2\xa0 And then, House Republicans say there was a new proposal that they presented to White House staff last night that also included reopening the government.\xc2\xa0 The White House has received that proposal, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not disputing that.\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m saying is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us what the White House\'s position -- it sounds like you\'re not accepting that proposal.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure we can clarify that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President and the Speaker agreed on in their phone conversation is that everybody should keep talking.\xc2\xa0 And the President appreciates the constructive approach that we\'ve been seeing, and that is certainly a change, and a welcome change, and he hopes that an agreement can be reached.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In relation to the proposal that has been discussed in the press, it\'s our view that we cannot have a situation where the debt ceiling is extended as part of a budget negotiation process for only six weeks, which would put us right back in the same position that we\xe2\x80\x99re in now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I know that this is not uncomplicated, but a clean debt ceiling increase for six weeks with no conditions attached to it is distinct from one that links it to a budget negotiation, and the continued threat of default as a point of leverage in a budget negotiation, which is just, again, continually putting the American economy at risk in an effort to achieve some partisan advantage, which we can\xe2\x80\x99t do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, furthermore, when it comes to various proposals that have been discussed, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly our view, as it has always been, that there is no reason to keep the government shut down.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to engage in constructive budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 He has seen indications from Republicans in both the Senate and the House in the last 24 hours that they, too, are interested in engaging in serious budget negotiations where we can achieve some of the goals that he put forward in his budget proposal -- buying down the sequester; investing in areas of our economy that will help it grow and protect the middle class; continuing the work of reducing our deficit and addressing our long-term debt.\xc2\xa0 And he very much looks forward to that.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to not open the government right away, in his view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re close to an agreement?\xc2\xa0 Are you getting anywhere at all in these talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the talks have been constructive and that there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition, at least among some Republicans and Republican leaders, that shutdown is not good for the American people and it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the American economy; that the threat of default is damaging to the economy, and default itself would be catastrophically damaging to the economy and the American people; and that that acknowledgement and those realizations have helped created an environment where it at least looks like there\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility of making some progress here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that we have to, again, remove these sort of demands for leverage, using essentially the American people and the economy in order to achieve what one side is seeking through negotiations, and simply engage in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t punish the American people because we here in Washington have different points of view about how we should invest moving forward and what mechanisms we can employ to further reduce our deficits.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, the talks have been -- and I think this is important, because it is a marked difference from where we had been -- the talks have been constructive, and the President appreciates the approach that the Speaker and others have taken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the biggest -- you mentioned this a couple of times.\xc2\xa0 Is the biggest hang-up now that length of the debt ceiling extension?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has a number of concerns with the proposal, although there are other parts of the proposal that he thinks reflects areas that we can find constructive agreement in.\xc2\xa0 And by \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d I mean not just the President and the Speaker, but any kind of budget deal would have to pass through both houses of Congress and that means agreement among both Democrats and Republicans in both houses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The one issue that I mentioned just now is that tying the extension of the debt ceiling for only six weeks to budget negotiations creates a dynamic that is very similar to the one we\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing now and very similar to the one that the country experienced back in 2011.\xc2\xa0 And it has been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, and it is one that he holds to this day, that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the appropriate way to go, and that we ought to remove -- Congress, Republicans ought to remove the threat of default as a point of leverage in budget negotiations because they\xe2\x80\x99re only doing harm to the American economy, they\xe2\x80\x99re only doing harm to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the President cannot, as he said so many times, pay ransom in exchange for Congress doing its fundamental -- fulfilling its fundamental responsibility, which is to ensure that the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t default and that it pays its bills.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, what did he tell Senate Republicans this morning?\xc2\xa0 We saw that Senator Cornyn said that it was a predictable lecture.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I saw some other senators -- Republican senators speak positively about the meeting, and the President felt that that was also a constructive meeting.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about Senator Cornyn\xe2\x80\x99s comments except to say that certainly the Senator should have expected the President to express his views on how we ought to move forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Republican senators held back or Republican house members have held back when expressing how they think we ought to move forward.\xc2\xa0 The whole point is, we need to have constructive negotiations about our budget choices not under a cloud that threatens default or continued government shutdown.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim, and then Jon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the administration\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with the Republican proposal.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House putting on the table?\xc2\xa0 What do you see as the most realistic proposal in terms of getting something done here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our position that there is no acceptable reason to keep the government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 All it does is harm Americans who are out there trying to make ends meet, harm the economy, and the government ought to be reopened.\xc2\xa0 So our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed there.\xc2\xa0 And our position on the debt ceiling hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, which is that it ought to be removed by Congress as a tool or a cudgel in budget negotiations, because in the precedent created in 2011, Republicans have, now for the second time, used the threat of default in an attempt to extract concessions that they could not extract through normal legislative means or through the election process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not personal.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not about this President.\xc2\xa0 It\'s unacceptable as a governing mechanism for this country moving forward, because it would create a scenario where quarter after quarter, or biannually, or yearly, we would have these manufactured crises.\xc2\xa0 And the crises alone, whether there was default or not, do harm to our economy -- slow growth, reduce job creation, squeeze the middle class, squeeze small businesses.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just not the way to do business.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'re seeing among a number of lawmakers both in the Senate and the House who are Republicans a recognition that this is not the right approach to take when we have sincerely held opinions about the kinds of decisions we need to make to move forward with our budget and our deficit reduction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed on the shutdown, the position hasn\'t changed on the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 How is that negotiating?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, look, the President has had constructive conversations with House and Senate Republicans.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also had very good conversations with House and Senate Democrats.\xc2\xa0 His position that it\'s unacceptable to demand a ransom from the American people in return for not defaulting, it\'s not going to change.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not going to change now, and it\'s not going to change in six weeks, and it\'s not going to change at any point during his presidency.\xc2\xa0 Nor does he expect that any of his successors will take a different position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has always been true is that this President is willing to sit down, roll up his sleeves and work out a common-sense budget agreement with Republicans that embodies both his objectives and Republican objectives in a compromise -- a compromise that achieves not everything he wants and achieves not everything that Republicans want, but through a compromise achieves what the American people and the American economy deserve, which is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re waiting for the white flag?\xc2\xa0 You\'re waiting for total capitulation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Jim, look, you guys want to turn this into a game of winners and losers.\xc2\xa0 And the President made clear the other day that in a situation where the government is shut down and one party in Congress is threatening default, and some of their loudest voices are encouraging default, nobody wins.\xc2\xa0 Nobody wins.\xc2\xa0 He wants a situation where we can discuss and debate our differences, and reach an agreement that reflects a willingness by both sides to compromise on behalf of the American people and the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And he believes it is possible. And he believes that, although we\'re not there yet and there\'s not an agreement, that there are indications in these last 24 hours from Republicans of a new willingness to explore that possibility.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, on a totally different subject -- as a Nobel Laureate, does the President think the Nobel committee blew it by not giving the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala Yousafzai?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say first that we\'ll be putting out a statement, but I wanted to say that President Obama congratulates the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -- the OPCW -- on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which reinforces the international community\'s commitment to the international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of the President\'s highest priorities is to prevent the proliferation or use of weapons of mass destruction.\xc2\xa0 And this award honors those who make it their life\'s work to advance this vital goal.\xc2\xa0 Since its establishment 16 years ago, the OPCW has stood at the forefront of the international community\'s efforts to verifiably eliminate some of the world\'s most dangerous weapons.\xc2\xa0 Today\'s award recognizes that commitment and reinforces the trust and confidence the world has placed in the OPCW, in its Director General, and the courageous OPCW experts and inspectors taking on the unprecedented challenge right now of eliminating Syria\'s chemical weapons program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. strongly supports the OPCW, including its joint work with the United Nations to ensure that Syria\'s chemical weapons stockpile are placed under international control and ultimately destroyed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToday, we again call on all nations to work to bring to an end the conflict that has cost the lives of more than 100,000 Syrians and to support the OPCW\'s efforts in the hope that future generations can live in a world free from the horrors of chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In answer to your question, that young woman\'s courage and efforts are remarkable, and the President absolutely honors them, as so many people around the world do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think the Nobel Committee blew it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t think the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people say she is like the most --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- as I just noted -- congratulates the winner of the Noble Peace Prize and obviously thinks that there\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous amount of good work being done around the world on behalf of peace and all of it should be recognized.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Republicans started this all off by demanding full defunding of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government for six weeks, a whole laundry list of Republican priorities in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Is it your sense, given where we are now, that Republicans have backed down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I would just say, as I mentioned before, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not really how it should be viewed, that it\'s a win/lose/zero-sum competition, because there are losers regardless in a process like this where government is shut down and default is threatened.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants that dynamic to change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe has made so very clear his willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise with Republicans on a longer-term budget deal. But he doesn\'t think that it\'s appropriate to exact a price from the American people or to punish the American economy in an effort to try to tip the balance of those discussions and negotiations by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty firm about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s encouraged by some of the developments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and he agrees with the Speaker that we need to continue talking, and hopes that we can reach a resolution here that removes the threat of default from the table for a considerable duration -- that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- allows the government to reopen as soon as possible, put people back to work and end this situation where there are terrible consequences occurring every day that we all hear about and you report on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then we can get about the business of hammering out a compromise that, if achieved, will give each side something to be proud of, something to point to and say, we got that because we thought it was so important and we were willing to work with the President and the Democrats -- this is the Republicans speaking\xc2\xa0 -- on what they insisted was important and we reached a compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if we can do that, on a longer term -- how long, obviously depends on what those negotiations look like -- it would be good for the American people and good for the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But virtually none of those original Republican demands are on the table still, are they?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, when it comes to threatening the full faith and credit of the United States, no demand, no matter how small, is acceptable.\xc2\xa0 You have to accept the basic premise that using that as leverage is highly damaging to the economy and to the American middle class.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve, again, seen over the course of the last several days and weeks a developing recognition that going down this path was not the right way to go for all the reasons and lessons that we learned back in 2011.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one last thing.\xc2\xa0 With apologies to Josh, can you explain to me how it is that West Wing Week is still being produced?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that really a central government service that is not shut down as part of the shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Office of Management and Budget in terms of what --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t mention the weekly video webcast.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Call the OMB.\xc2\xa0 But the communications office obviously is significantly slimmed down, as are so many offices here, but communications are a part of what we need to do at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is it fair to say that the conversation now is about not whether to avoid default, but the duration?\xc2\xa0 That is what is being passed back and forth in these conversations?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put terminology on it that everyone is very sensitive to -- negotiations, whatever it is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement to avoid default and the central issue is for how long?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into depth about conversations that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read out, I would simply say that, based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Republican leaders in both houses, there is a recognition that default is not an acceptable outcome and not an option.\xc2\xa0 And it is true that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- we have great concerns about any proposition that would tie the next extension of the debt ceiling directly to budget negotiations in six weeks, right before we have the most important retails season --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the conversations were about something longer than that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely our view that we should remove renewal of the debt ceiling or extension of the debt ceiling from this conversation, that the threat of default should not be part of negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been our position all along.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Has in the last 24 hours, a discussion about reopening the government for a period of time, longer than had been previously discussed, which is either two months or three months -- is that also now comingled with this conversation about extending the debt limit -- meaning, for a longer period that we\xe2\x80\x99re really talking about now is not whether but duration.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s more to it than duration.\xc2\xa0 Our view is the government ought to be reopened right away.\xc2\xa0 It should have been reopened yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It should never have been shut down.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that the debt ceiling, the commitment by the Congress to pay our bills, should be renewed right way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But all of us are trying to figure out what is the central element of these conversations and what is the goal that both sides are bringing.\xc2\xa0 And so it seems to me fair to ask you -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not really talking about whether to do these things, but for how long, and then what\xe2\x80\x99s the framework of negotiations that attach to that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, broadly speaking, that\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair characterization?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fair, but obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more to it than that.\xc2\xa0 What we think is not the right way to go is to try again, after we\xe2\x80\x99ve just been through this and after we went through it two years -- to link extension of the debt ceiling to budget negotiations, and therefore link the possibility of default to whether or not one side gets what it wants in those budget negotiations, because --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there has to be a clear delineation of that, or whatever you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe, the President supports a position that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Republicans are moving in that direction, would you say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for the Republicans except to say that we think the talks have been constructive and we think that Republican leaders are looking for a way to extend the debt ceiling and to fund the government.\xc2\xa0 We just need to -- they need to continue talking.\xc2\xa0 There needs to be continued discussions on Capitol Hill, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we get.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our view is that -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that we ought to -- there is no reason, there is no actual reason I have even seen logically articulated by Republicans for why they insist on, or would insist on continuing to shut the government down -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s only -- I mean, average folks out there are paying the price and the economy is paying the price.\xc2\xa0 And that ought to be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so these talks are now about resolving both?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize conversations that are taking place on Capitol Hill or here in any great detail, except to reiterate what our firm position has been.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow could be a very interesting and possibly important day, because House Republicans have said they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a vote on the debt limit extension one way or the other. It would either be the original thing they brought here yesterday, which is November 22nd, or something that would reflect what is now, I believe, being jointly discussed, something that\xe2\x80\x99s longer and more comprehensive and possibly that could be described as a deal.\xc2\xa0 Does that comport with your understanding that the timeline would be something by tomorrow, and that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really can honestly say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if and when the House is going to act on any proposed legislation.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a sense of urgency about getting things done tonight?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President just spoke with the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously met with Senate Republicans and has now met with members of both parties of both houses, and will continue -- broadly, will continue to have conversations.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that everyone recognize that default is not an option and that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously in a better place than we were a few days ago in terms of the constructive approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of late, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our view, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, that we ought to just -- that the Congress ought to and the House ought to allow the government to reopen, and to pass a bill that raises the debt ceiling, so that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to everyone that we can\xe2\x80\x99t use that -- that no party should use the threat of default as leverage to try to achieve something through budget negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re a country where the two dominant parties -- and each is substantially represented here in Washington, and budget negotiations and a compromise will, by definition, if one is reached, reflect some of what each side wants.\xc2\xa0 So that is highly achievable.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary to pursue and engage in budget negotiations under threat of default or continued shutdown.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before I let you go, obviously everyone is going to be in town this weekend.\xc2\xa0 The international markets will be weighing and monitoring what happens this weekend very carefully.\xc2\xa0 It will be the last time before we start really getting closer to this October 17th deadline.\xc2\xa0 Do you not agree that there is something very important about what does or does not happen, either here or on the floor of the House and Senate, this weekend on this question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly agree that we\xe2\x80\x99re long past --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not that much of a sense of urgency to these conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the time when people ought to be able to go back to -- should have been able to go back to work and the government should have been reopened.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously coming very close to a deadline that would put us beyond where we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been before, where the United States of America would not have the capacity to borrow and would only be able to use cash on hand to pay its bills.\xc2\xa0 And that would be, by any serious economist\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning, a very dangerous place for the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we should not get there.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly hopes that Congress acts to remove that threat as soon as possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carrie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the source of disagreement right now with the House GOP proposal that there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- putting entitlement reforms on the table, Medicare means-testing, but not revenue, a promise of looking at revenue as well in budget negotiations -- is that one issue that the White House has with this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Carrie, is, A, that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about conversations and proposals that are being discussed.\xc2\xa0 I will say broadly that the President believes that tough choices have to be made and can be made as part of a compromise budget agreement that moves our country forward and reduces the deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe has a proposal on the table that would deal with this over a 10-year period and would reduce our deficit beyond -- would buy back the sequester and then reduce the deficit beyond what is achieved through sequester.\xc2\xa0 And that would include, in a balanced way, some of the kinds of reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing discussed today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut remember, that was part of a broad package and a balanced package.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s interest by both parties, in both houses, in buying back the sequester is a good thing in our view.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly interested in budget negotiations that try to tackle that challenge and that shared goal and in budget negotiations that would look at a variety of means of achieving that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, having said that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll restate that we need to continue to have conversations, and the House and the Senate and Democrats and Republicans need to continue to have conversations.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to remove the threat of default from this process and to open the government as soon as possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the entitlements are put on the table specifically, which they seem to -- the GOP seems to have done, does the President need revenues to be specified as well, that that is also going to be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is reflected in his budget, when you talk about comprehensive, broad, long-term budget negotiations that try to achieve a comprehensive, long-term deal.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has always been that we need to, when it comes to deficit reduction, tackle that in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in his budget through both savings from entitlement reforms and savings through tax reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re not at the point of negotiations like that.\xc2\xa0 The President has been eager to have those negotiations all year long, and has met repeatedly with Republicans over the course of the year in an effort to try to find that common ground on these very issues.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to doing so again.\xc2\xa0 But we need to continue to explore the possibility of resolving this imminent -- this real and current conflict that has led them to shut down the government and threaten default, and then we can move on to broader negotiations over how we achieve our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 Is that satisfactory?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of -- can you just sort of clarify, are you negotiating something, or not?\xc2\xa0 Because the stance has been no negotiation.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems clear that if the Republicans open up the government that you guys have agreed to give them something in return.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- or else you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the midst of trading proposals.\xc2\xa0 Not to get pedantic here, but it does seem as if you have moved off the position of, we\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you need to remember what our position is specifically -- and I understand the question.\xc2\xa0 The President is absolutely committed to the proposition that the American people should not and cannot pay ransom in exchange for Congress doing its job when it comes to its fundamental responsibilities of ensuring that the government stays open, or, even more importantly, ensuring that the United States pays its bills.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the debt ceiling, which will be breached for the first time in our history in just a few days if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take the necessary action, it is absolutely his view that demands for ransom of any kind, any kind of extraction of a concession from him or from the American people through him are unacceptable in exchange for ensuring that we do not default.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is he offering then?\xc2\xa0 He must be offering something or -- put it this way -- there are a lot of people on Capitol Hill, there are a lot of House Republicans and a lot of Senate Republicans who have come away from this meeting believing, okay, the President is now going to at least give us something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the conversations, at the very least, when it comes to what Republicans have heard from the President, have reinforced what the President has tried to convey through his proposals and through what he said publicly and privately, that he is serious about finding compromise when it comes to our budget challenges and that he wants to get to work resolving them, and believes that there are in both houses potential partners with both Democrats and Republicans to achieve that compromise.\xc2\xa0 But he won\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that if there is something they come up with from what would be future budget talks to open up the government right now and John Boehner needs it to get the votes, you guys are, like, fine.\xc2\xa0 Is that what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at there?\xc2\xa0 Basically you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s something we would have given you in the budget negotiations; if you need it earlier to get the votes to reopen the government, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to draw a line in the sand?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to achieve a comprehensive budget agreement of the kind that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the President\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year proposal in a matter of days -- unless there\xe2\x80\x99s a sudden willingness by Republicans to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s one piece of it they\xe2\x80\x99d take that they like?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think therein lies the rub, right?\xc2\xa0 So we believe that precisely because budget negotiations are a complicated business and each side has principled views, that they should not be conducted under the cloud of continued shutdown and certainly not conducted under the threat of default. That\xe2\x80\x99s been our position all along.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably made for less interesting copy, but there\xe2\x80\x99s been enormous consistency in our statement of that position from the beginning here.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that that position reflects some lessons learned from what happened in 2011.\xc2\xa0 And what we can\xe2\x80\x99t do is recreate the 2011 experience for the American people, because they paid a significant price just for the flirtation with default that Republicans engaged in two years ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give the President\xe2\x80\x99s or the White House version of events of the Ted Cruz back-and-forth?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not going to say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said of the meeting itself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My understanding is the Senator gave a pretty impassioned question about the health care law and that the President gave a pretty somewhat dismissive answer to Senator Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any further readout on what the President thought was a constructive meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, did the President convey in his conversation with the Speaker that he wants a longer-term debt limit increase and that -- can you just clarify that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific to read out from the conversation itself.\xc2\xa0 I can say our position is -- and our position in public is the same as it is in private -- that it is the right thing to do to remove that gun from the table, the negotiating table, ensure that the debt ceiling is raised for as long a duration as possible so that it is not -- no one is tempted -- in this case, only Republicans have been tempted -- but no one is tempted to use the threat of default as a means of extracting political concessions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the Senate Republicans came away from their meeting with the President with the impression that he\xe2\x80\x99s backing away from his support for something short term.\xc2\xa0 Is that from your guys\' perspective an accurate picture of what happened?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is that it has never been our desired outcome that Congress only reopen the government for a short term, or Congress only lift the debt ceiling for a short term.\xc2\xa0 That is -- and I think I\'ve said this verbatim in the past -- the least they could do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo is it still acceptable as the bare minimum?\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s absolutely -- if the Congress were to pass a clean debt ceiling of short duration to avoid default, the President would sign that.\xc2\xa0 But as I\'ve said in the past, whether the Congress extends the debt ceiling for a short term or a medium term or long term, the President\'s position on refusing to pay ransom in exchange for Congress fulfilling their responsibility to pay the bills of the United States will not change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, lastly, does the White House see promise in Senator Collins\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, given your desire for something longer?\xc2\xa0 Is that an avenue that you think might be more fruitful?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that a number of lawmakers in the Senate as well as the House have expressed views that are constructive, in our estimation.\xc2\xa0 Senator Collins is one of them. But I\'m not going to evaluate from here a specific proposal beyond what I\'ve said thus far.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did you answer Chuck by saying that, yes, these talks and meetings and phone calls and conversations amount to negotiating?\xc2\xa0 Or are you still avoiding that word?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, our position that there\'s no ransom that can be paid.\xc2\xa0 And when you say "negotiation," if you mean it in the terms of like you extract from one side what you want in return for something else -- when it comes to raising the debt ceiling, the President firmly believes it is not good for the American people or the American economy or the global economy for any President of either party, or any party in the future, to pay the opposition party a political price in exchange for it fulfilling that fundamental responsibility, because you get into a situation -- which we\'re now experiencing and which we experienced in 2011 -- whereby one faction of one party manufactures a crisis that does harm to the economy and harm to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we ought not do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBecause it\'s a complicated piece of business with an unfortunate term attached to it, the debt ceiling, but it is really simply about authorizing the United States government to pay the bills that Congress has incurred.\xc2\xa0 So not paying those bills would make us a deadbeat nation.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that I don\'t think any American reasonably would find acceptable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But you said earlier the President has a number of concerns with the proposal from the House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That sounds like negotiating.\xc2\xa0 Can we use that word, or you would object to it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can use any word you want to describe it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the beauty of the free press.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does it come with a Jay Carney phone call after?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe an email or a Tweet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut saying that we believe that conversations have been constructive and that the proposal that Republicans from the House have put forward represents in part progress, I think reflects where we are in this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t want to use that word.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re not -- when it comes to raising the debt ceiling --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand all of that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying, this back- and-forth, that\'s negotiating, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re listening and we\'re talking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, one last question.\xc2\xa0 Last evening, the President signed the mini funding bill to restore funding to military death benefits.\xc2\xa0 A day earlier you had said it wasn\'t necessary, you didn\'t need it; he wasn\'t going to sign it.\xc2\xa0 What changed his mind?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, at the time, the legislation had not reached his desk.\xc2\xa0 And he had asked his Chief of Staff to find a creative solution to this problem as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And thanks to the generosity of the Fisher House and its willingness to help us deliver these benefits to families, an agreement was reached between the Department of Defense and the Fisher House that was a temporary solution to this problem.\xc2\xa0 Now, the legislation obviously, once passed and signed into law, obviates the need for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my point all along was that the way to resolve that problem and all these problems instantly is to reopen the government and to restore funding at levels that Republicans themselves felt were appropriate for the previous fiscal year, so that when the legislation was passed and the President was able to sign it, he did because he felt it was very important that these benefits be guaranteed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe is enormously appreciative of the generosity of the Fisher House and of the work done by folks at OMB and DOD to come up with a solution that appeared to be needed, because it is essential that these benefits be provided.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then is it no longer a matter of principle that President Obama will not sign any other of these many funding bills?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, as you know, he signed the Pay Our Military Act because of the enormous and unique sacrifice that our military families provide.\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely our position that attempts to solve a political problem by their decision to shut down the government through piecemeal legislation are not -- are gimmicks, broadly speaking, and that the way to resolve this political problem for the Republicans and the way to resolve this real problem and this real pain that their decision to shut down the government has caused the American people is to reopen the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the proposition that we\xe2\x80\x99ve always put forward that Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi agreed with was that we should -- that Congress should pass a bill that would extend government funding levels at -- extend government funding at the levels that were set for the previous fiscal year for a relatively short duration to allow for substantive budget negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the light of -- the very little light of today, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely reasonable position and hardly represents a demand or a concession to the President or the Democrats to go along with that.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that position.\xc2\xa0 And all of this hardship that the American people have experienced thus far and the confusion, and the real suffering as well as the inconvenience could have been avoided and can be avoided in the future if the Congress, the House would simply reopen the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Some senators left here today thinking the President is open to some tweaks to the Affordable Care Act -- that don\xe2\x80\x99t gut it, but just tweak it.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has said I think publicly many times that he is open to suggestions from any quarter about how to improve the Affordable Care Act, make the benefits that it provides the American people better and more efficiently delivered.\xc2\xa0 And he understands that with any kind of program like this and legislation like this, as was the case with Social Security and Medicare and Medicare Part D, and the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program, there are ways to improve it -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What he of course won\xe2\x80\x99t accept is improvements -- or actually efforts to do away with the Affordable Care Act that come in the guise of improvements or delays or modest defunding.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it here that some of the ideas that have obviously been pretty firmly rejected by a majority of the American people that have been put forward by Republicans as part of this debate and gussied up as mere adjustments or delays of the Affordable Care Act were sincere efforts to try to eliminate it indirectly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President firmly believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to provide access to affordable health insurance to millions of Americans, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Affordable Care Act does and will do.\xc2\xa0 And as is the case now, since the marketplaces have been opening, individuals across the country are finding out that they have a variety of options available to them at affordable prices to get quality health insurance that they never could have gotten before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the delay of the medical device tax is one that is coming up again and again now, but does that fall under the category of delays that he would find damaging to the rule itself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- again, the President is open, without threats of continued shutdown or threats of default, to having serious conversations about budget priorities, budget proposals, as well as any ideas that any lawmaker might have about ways to improve the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to look at any proposal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the one you mention, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that eliminating that provision would substantially increase the deficit.\xc2\xa0 So that is something that would greatly concern him.\xc2\xa0 Any proposal that anyone put forward would have to take into account the much unremarked-upon fact by Republicans that the Affordable Care Act reduces the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Again, as scored by the CBO and independent economists, the Affordable Care Act is a deficit reducer.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s paid for, and then some, in the medium and long term.\xc2\xa0 So it would be very important to the President to ensure that that principle is maintained regardless of the proposals that are put forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ari.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple days ago the White House was very unhappy about Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s decision to show up at the White House with just 18 or 20 Republicans instead of the entire conference, but it seems like it was actually one of the most productive meetings that have happened since the shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Do you regret the position the White House took?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t regret inviting every member of Congress to the White House.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The position in saying that it would be less productive for Boehner to show up with the smaller group that he brought.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, our position was that we regretted that all members of the House weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to come -- all members of the Republican conference, simply because it is a -- as the Speaker of the House himself has often noted -- a diverse bunch with sometimes conflicting opinions about policy and the President, and that it would have been useful I think for everyone to have a face-to-face conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having said that, we still have that view, Ari, but it is the case that yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with that subset, that leadership subset of the House Republican conference was constructive, and we believe it is the right thing to do to continue to have talks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing I wanted to ask was you said Republicans suddenly seem to have come around to the view that the threat of default is not good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Some of them have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of them have.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the timing of that view coinciding with the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll showing terrible numbers for Republicans was coincidental?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Were I still a reporter covering Congress and Republicans in Congress as I once did, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible I could reach that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage my former colleagues and those who are doing what I used to do to dig a little deeper into the bigger issues, which I think reflects what I was saying earlier.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- whatever the motivation is, it\xe2\x80\x99s always been our position that if you\xe2\x80\x99re taking action in Washington that hurts the American people and hurts the American economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to be very popular -- at least broadly across the nation.\xc2\xa0 So I think that may be what is reflected in some of this data.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the fact of the matter is, nobody wins when Washington is dysfunctional and one party holds the whole process hostage to demands that are unreasonable.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition that we need to move away from that dynamic and instead open the government, remove the threat of default, and engage in a serious-minded negotiation where I can promise -- (laughter) -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that -- open the government, remove the threat of default, and let\xe2\x80\x99s negotiate about our budget priorities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I promise you that that negotiation will result -- that if there is a conclusion to that negotiation that is a compromise, that would mean that each side got some of what it wanted but neither side got all of what it wanted.\xc2\xa0 And that is how it should be.\xc2\xa0 And that is the spirit in which the President has always approached this process -- recognizing that we have a system of government with two strong parties that are represented in different proportions in each House in Congress as well as here at the White House, and that no one gets everything he or she wants when it comes to these kinds of negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These things are hard enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the right approach to take, then, to somehow achieve what you want by threatening default or threatening to shut down the government and keep people out of work for a sustained period of time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always been our position.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a position that then don\xe2\x80\x99t do these things and therefore we get everything we want; the President knows full well that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get everything he wants.\xc2\xa0 His budget proposal recognizes that from the outset.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve Dennis, and then Cheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99ve moved and Democrats have moved --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have called on him, right? (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 A little too plugged-in.\xc2\xa0 Never mind, he can\xe2\x80\x99t think of what to say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to be careful with this, because you\'ve been dancing around the negotiation question.\xc2\xa0 For weeks now, you guys have wanted a clean CR.\xc2\xa0 And now it seems you\'re willing to negotiate a mini-deal that would get attached to a clean CR -- things with give-and-take, things that you want, things that the Republicans want attached to a clean CR.\xc2\xa0 So you\'d have a policy sidecar, not just a process sidecar.\xc2\xa0 That\'s new.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I understand the question and it\'s a smart one.\xc2\xa0 But here\'s -- let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 Our position has always been that at the very least Congress ought not to allow the government to shut down, that Republicans should not shut down the government and that the House of Representatives should do what the Senate did, which is pass a clean CR funding the government at levels set in the previous fiscal year by largely Republicans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it has also been our position that we envision a bigger and broader and more substantive budget compromise that achieved some of the goals that the President has been talking about for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And those goals include continued deficit reduction, they include dealing with the problem with the sequester, and they include key investments in areas of our economy and our middle class that will help us grow stronger in the future and create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 So, both are true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the very least, our position has been that the Republicans should not have shut down the government, that when it became clear they weren\'t going to get what they wanted in return for when the fiscal year ended, that they should have done the very least, which is what the Senate did, and that is pass an extension of spending at current levels short term, to allow for further budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they chose to shut the government down to try to use pain and suffering of the American people and the harm to the American economy as leverage to get what they wanted.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s fair to say that hasn\'t worked for them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are encouraged by the constructive approach that Republicans have taken in conversations with the President and others in recent hours and days.\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t have an agreement yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to say that you\'re willing to negotiate and are trying to negotiate a mini deal that gives both sides something that they want that would not be considered a ransom, which is still -- there won\'t be a ransom?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- I mean, no, I don\'t think I can characterize the conversations that way.\xc2\xa0 What we are looking for is a way to see if the Congress -- and in particular, Republicans in the Congress, in agreement with Democrats -- can reopen the government, which is something we\'ve asked them to do from day one, and then remove the threat of default from this whole process.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our position and our view, and it\'s one that we\'ve expressed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have seen constructive signs and appreciate them, coming from the Republican side, and believe, as the Speaker said or his spokesman said in their readout of the phone call with the President, that it\'s important to continue to talk, that all sides continue to talk.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl, last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really concretely --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what is the next step?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you waiting for Boehner to come back with a new proposal tonight?\xc2\xa0 Does he need to talk with McConnell?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s fair to say that when it comes to specifics about talks and conversations that I\'m not going to have a lot to offer you today, it\'s pretty evident, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President talked to Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Is he waiting for now a new proposal --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is what the Speaker\'s spokesman said, which is that the President and he agreed to continue talking and that all sides should continue talking, and that we think what we\'ve seen thus far represents a constructive approach.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, Congress will reach an agreement of some kind that will allow them to open the government -- reopen the government and remove the threat of default from this whole process, because it\'s enormously damaging to the economy and to the American people.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, Jay -- updates over the weekend on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling updates.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, we\'ll keep you updated as we have more information about things happening here.\xc2\xa0 But I have nothing on tomorrow\'s schedule or Sunday or Monday\xe2\x80\x99s at this --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t have one.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a fairly fluid situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I understand -- just not anticipate seeing the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly have no scheduling announcements of that kind to make.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect to make them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect that, but I would never -- the normal process we follow of giving a lid and things like that will be followed in this case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if President Obama had done the Asia trip, would he have gone to Afghanistan today?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry was in Afghanistan or went to Afghanistan today, filling in for the President on the rest of the trip.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I\'m asking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was not a plan to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 5:01 P.M.
