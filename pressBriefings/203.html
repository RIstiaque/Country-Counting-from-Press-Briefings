Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:03 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everyone. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0I wanted to call to your attention one thing before we get into questions. \xc2\xa0We had a back-and-forth in this room yesterday about recent reports out of Afghanistan about some reprehensible conduct of some Afghan soldiers. \xc2\xa0And overnight the Commander of U.S. Force in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, issued a statement and I wanted to commend it to your attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn that statement, he makes clear that throughout his many tours of duty in Afghanistan that he has never been aware of a command policy to ignore suspicions of sexual abuse that\'s committed by Afghans against children. \xc2\xa0And he repeated that no such policy has been in place certainly while he has been commander.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his statement, he makes clear that he has ordered all of the personnel that are under his command in Afghanistan to ensure that suspicions of sexual abuse are immediately reported up the chain of command. \xc2\xa0And he also said that those reports would be forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate so that the government of Afghanistan could take the necessary steps in pursuit of justice against Afghan soldiers.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe took the additional step of raising this issue directly with President Ghani, and he secured a commitment from President Ghani that the Afghan government would redouble their efforts to investigate these claims and to ensure that those who are guilty of perpetrating these claims are held accountable and that justice is properly administered.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, for those of you who that have not seen the statement, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather lengthy but certainly is an important one. \xc2\xa0And we can make sure that you get it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all that, Kevin, you can get us started with questions. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s your first time in the front row. Welcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0President Obama told business leaders last week he wanted to establish rules of the road on cyber intrusions. \xc2\xa0To follow up on that, what does the administration consider to be legitimate computer hacking? \xc2\xa0And what does the administration want to make clear is out of bounds? \xc2\xa0And will the failure to come up with a road map this weekend more likely lead to economic sanctions against the Chinese entities?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, let me say a couple things about that. \xc2\xa0The United States has been quite clear about the concerns that we have about China\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in cyberspace, and there is a very specific way that we have described what those concerns are -- or I guess what those principal concerns are. \xc2\xa0We have a variety of concerns. \xc2\xa0But our principal concerns center around what we have described as government-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft of confidential business information and proprietary technology from U.S. companies for financial gain.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that has been something that we have long been concerned about. \xc2\xa0It, frankly, predates the administration of President Xi. \xc2\xa0And this is a concern that President Obama has raised directly both with President Xi in their previous meetings, but also with President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s *counterpart predecessor on those occasions when the President had the opportunity to meet him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a number of steps that we have already taken to make quite clear publicly our concerns. \xc2\xa0One of those was a decision by the Department of Justice to indict five Chinese military officials for their actions in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0And I think we got the best evidence that the Xi government understands how serious our concerns are because they dispatched a senior Chinese official, Secretary Meng, to travel to the United States and participate in conversations with a variety of U.S. government officials, including White House officials. \xc2\xa0And so I think it is quite clear to the Chinese exactly how serious our concerns are.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview what the discussions between President Obama and President Xi could look like other than to tell you that this issue will feature quite prominently on their agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0With Pope Francis arriving in just a few hours, what specific issues will the President raise with him? \xc2\xa0And what does the President hope will be the long-term accomplishment of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is not the first opportunity that President Obama has had to meet with Pope Francis. \xc2\xa0The President traveled to Europe last year and had the opportunity to travel to the Vatican and meet Pope Francis for the first time there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is looking forward to welcoming Pope Francis to the United States later today. \xc2\xa0I understand that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually his first visit to the United States not just as Pope, but his first visit to the United States ever. \xc2\xa0And it is an opportunity for the citizens of this country to welcome him and show how warmly his message has been received in this country by both Catholics and non-Catholics alike. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe serves as a role model for so many based on the way that he has lived out the values in his life. \xc2\xa0He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just talk about them, but he lives them. \xc2\xa0And I think that has really struck a chord in many people, some of whom don\xe2\x80\x99t even share the Catholic faith with Pope Francis. \xc2\xa0But they admire the way that he has lived his life. \xc2\xa0They admire the way that he has articulated his values, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of not just respect but a lot of admiration in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is looking forward to the opportunity to formally welcome him to the White House tomorrow morning, and certainly is most looking forward to, I think, the opportunity to visit with him in the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0I would not expect a robust discussion of a political agenda, but rather I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the two men to talk about the values that they have in common. \xc2\xa0And there are many.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s President Hadi has returned to Aden after nearly six months in exile. \xc2\xa0Does the White House see this as a sign of improved conditions in Yemen? \xc2\xa0And will the President meet with President Hadi at the U.N. in the coming days?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in New York to discuss at this point. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for New York is still being finalized. \xc2\xa0And I would expect in the next couple of days that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details about that schedule and we can talk more not just about the events in which the President will participate, but also some of the meetings that he intends to do with other world leaders who are also participating at the U.N. General Assembly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the situation in Yemen, we continue to be quite concerned about how the violence and political instability in that country has contributed to a significant humanitarian problem. \xc2\xa0And we continue to urge all parties in that conflict to participate in the talks that the U.N. is trying to get started to try to bring about a political resolution to the turmoil there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States for some time now has been providing support to our partners in Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries who I think are understandably concerned about the security situation along their southern border, but we have urged restraint on all sides. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that. \xc2\xa0Because ultimately, like so many other situations that are often compared to Yemen, the solution there is not going to be found in the continued use of military force, but rather through the eventual success of diplomatic talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also reports out just an hour ago that retired General John Allen will be stepping down from his position as the envoy in the U.S. coalition to fight the Islamic State. \xc2\xa0Is that something you can confirm? \xc2\xa0And if so, what does his stepping down signal about the U.S. strategy in fighting Islamic State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have anything to confirm at this point. \xc2\xa0For questions about personnel I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department. \xc2\xa0I guess for questions about the State Department personnel, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can say more generally about General Allen is he is somebody who signed up for a six-month tour, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been on the job for I believe more than a year now. \xc2\xa0So that is an indication of the commitment to his service that he\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe had the opportunity just a couple of weeks ago to do an interview with a television network where he discussed his ongoing efforts to build the international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a variety of ways to point to the progress that that coalition has made. \xc2\xa0I think the best one I can direct you toward is the recent commitment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve received from Turkey to more deeply engage in this international effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that has included stepped-up efforts on the part of the Turks to engage militarily and support ongoing military efforts there. \xc2\xa0It also reflects the recent commitment of the Turks to allow the United States and our coalition partners to use certain military facilities inside of Turkey that will facilitate the more effective application of military force inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to General Allen\xe2\x80\x99s future plans, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did General Allen ever express his frustrations with the President over at the White House about the failure to get adequate resources in the fight, particularly in training Syrian opposition fighters? \xc2\xa0As we know last week, there are only four or five of them. \xc2\xa0Or were there discussions of him wanting any more resources that he felt like he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to get? \xc2\xa0Did he share those frustrations with the White House?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\'t have any specific conversations to tell you about other than to say General Allen over the last year has played an important role in helping to assemble the kind of international coalition that has contributed greatly to the progress that has been made in the fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\'t have any additional light to shed on any confidential conversations that General Allen has participated in.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To follow up on Julia\xe2\x80\x99s question about General Allen, to ask her question a different way, the news that came out last week about the four or five trained fighters, obviously, that led you to say that they experienced some difficulties in that program. \xc2\xa0Did that story, did that news in any way change the President\xe2\x80\x99s view or his attitude toward General Allen? \xc2\xa0Did he lose any confidence in General Allen in the last several months that he\xe2\x80\x99s been on this job leading this push against ISIS?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Of course not. \xc2\xa0General Allen\xe2\x80\x99s principal responsibility was to help build this international coalition that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed on a few occasions here, has been far more broad and far more intensive than I think any of us expected a year or so ago. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall last August, a lot of intense skepticism about how much success the United States would have in building a genuine international coalition to take the fight to ISIL and to carry out all elements of our strategy against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is, I think there are 62 countries now that are actively participating in that effort, including Turkey. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recent indications from our partners in both the U.K. and in France that they\'re prepared -- or at least considering, if not prepared to expand their involvement in these efforts. \xc2\xa0Currently both of those two nations are intimately involved in our operations against ISIL inside of Iraq. \xc2\xa0And they have recently announced that they are ramping up their activities inside of Syria, as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of that is a testament to the kind of momentum that is behind our ongoing diplomatic efforts to build and strengthen this coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And General Allen certainly deserves a lot of credit for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you talk a little bit about the symbolic importance of the President and the First Lady and the First Family and Vice President all greeting Pope Francis at Andrews? \xc2\xa0I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a bit of pomp and circumstance. \xc2\xa0But what does it mean to this President? \xc2\xa0Why is he going to these lengths?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Pope Francis, we have seen, has really struck a chord in people not just across the United States, but around the world. \xc2\xa0And, again, the kind of inspiration -- he serves as a source of inspiration not just for Catholics but of people of, frankly, all religions around the world that share the values of Pope Francis and certainly share the values that he has discussed and tried to live out in his life, particularly his commitment to social and economic justice. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important symbol of the amount of respect and admiration -- not just that the First Family has for Pope Francis but that the American people have for Pope Francis -- that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see such a warm reception for him when he arrives to the United States this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to ask the previous question in a different way. \xc2\xa0Last year when the President had the press conference with Prime Minister Renzi in Rome after his meeting with the Pope, we were all curious if the President was discussing with the Pope this issue of contraception and the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And the President went off and said, you know what, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t really talk about that -- we talked about immigration, we talked about income inequality, talked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, when they have discussions this week, is there some business that the President would like to see the Pope help him with? \xc2\xa0Are there some big-ticket items left in the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the Pope help him on? \xc2\xa0Obviously Cuba was conducted largely in secret, the public was not aware of that. \xc2\xa0Do they still have some business to attend to in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remaining time in office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have discussed the important role that the Vatican played in supporting the efforts of the government of Cuba and the government of the United States to begin to normalize the relations between our two countries. \xc2\xa0There is no doubt that the moral influence and the trust that both the Cuban government and the Cuban people and the American government and the American people place in the moral leadership of Pope Francis was an important part of finally completing that agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when the President sits down with Pope Francis tomorrow in the Oval Office, the President will not arrive at that meeting with a political agenda. \xc2\xa0This is an opportunity for two men who have so many values in common to talk about the efforts that they are taking in their respective and quite different roles to advance those shared values.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there much business to attend to now? \xc2\xa0Is there less on their agenda than there was previously, would you say? \xc2\xa0Is this more of a social house call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the President is looking forward to it. \xc2\xa0I think the President thinks it will be an interesting meeting that he is looking forward to, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe it as a social meeting. \xc2\xa0I think that the way that both of these men have dedicated their lives to advancing values related to social justice and prioritizing those who are less fortunate, and that they pursue those values with a sense of conviction I think gives them a lot of serious things to talk about. \xc2\xa0And certainly the way that President Obama has prioritized those kinds of issues throughout his career, even before he arrived in the presidency, I think should give you an indication of how important the President thinks this meeting is.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So just following up on the Pope and the meeting, which you say will largely be about talking about values, shared values. \xc2\xa0Of course, there are values that they do not share. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, will the President give as much weight to listening to the Pope about issues such as abortion, Planned Parenthood, contraception, as he will listening to the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s values about global warming and other things they do share? \xc2\xa0How much weight will he give to listening to those things where the Pope does disagree with him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President will arrive at this meeting with a very open mind. \xc2\xa0And I think he is very interested in hearing what\xe2\x80\x99s on the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s mind and what\xe2\x80\x99s in the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and I think the President will join that conversation in a spirit of respect. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not those issues will come up in their meeting, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that if they do that it will be an opportunity for the men to speak honestly with one another but also in a tone of respect that illustrates just how much they have in common. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there are areas where they may not see things the same way, but I do think that, certainly when it comes to the President, that he understands the motivation that the Pope has and that he is interested in pursuing these values for all of the right reasons. \xc2\xa0And the President, even if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him in every respect, certainly does hold the Pope and his views in high regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just if I can flip that a little bit, is it any less legitimate for members of Congress to reject the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s views on global warming or Cuba than when others reject the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s views on abortion or the death penalty? \xc2\xa0Is it any less legitimate to reject those views than his views which you agree with?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult thing to discuss. \xc2\xa0I think people take -- I think hold strong personal feelings about the way they interpret and listen to the teachings of a religious leader like the Pope. \xc2\xa0I think what has been complicated for some is that they have sought in some instances to highlight those areas where they agree with the Pope and explicitly try to draw political benefit from that, and then try to explain away those areas where they might disagree. \xc2\xa0And that has left them -- at least some of them, including some presidential candidates -- in the awkward position of trying to suggest that the Pope is just making a political statement when he is talking about things they don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to agree with but that the Pope has a real conviction on those areas where they do agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t, frankly, think that reflects how the Pope has written about some of these issues -- climate change comes to mind. \xc2\xa0And you can look at that document that was issued by the Vatican and I think you can see the way that the views that are articulated in that document are informed by the views and teachings and theology of the Catholic Church. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been awkward for some politicians to explain away.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the approach the President takes is quite different, which is acknowledging on the front end that this is not a meeting between politicians and this is not an effort to advance anybody\xe2\x80\x99s political agenda, but rather it is an opportunity for two respected world leaders with significant influence around the globe to spend some time talking about the values that they hold in common, and to do so in an atmosphere of respect. \xc2\xa0And it is an opportunity for the President to illustrate the deep admiration that the American people have for Pope Francis and his leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the President asked his staff to make sure that the visit of the Pope has a lasting value. \xc2\xa0Can you give us an idea of how that would be manifested? \xc2\xa0And will there be any kind of initiatives coming out of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge anything about the meeting at this point. \xc2\xa0But our goal here has been to ensure that the way that the Pope is received here in the United States is consistent with the warm feelings of admiration and respect that the American people have for the Pope, his teaching, his values and the way that he has lived his life. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHis willingness to say what he believes and to live out those values have deeply inspired a lot of people, including many non-Catholics. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s that moral authority that the Pope has that we\xe2\x80\x99re eager to show respect for. \xc2\xa0And tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting will be interesting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The issues that come out of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s -- that are his moral values -- income inequality, protecting the environment and that kind of thing -- aren\xe2\x80\x99t those basically political values for the President? \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t they equate to political values?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do think that in the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s values -- some of which you named there -- do have an impact and do guide the kind of priorities the President has set when it comes to his political agenda. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to ensure that while the two men have any number of shared values, that I\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant to ascribe any political views to the Pope. \xc2\xa0He can certainly speak for himself when it comes to his view on a variety of political positions. \xc2\xa0The goal of this meeting is to give the two men the opportunity to talk about their shared values. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere will be time for politics, frankly, all 364 days -- the other 364 days of the year. \xc2\xa0But tomorrow, at least for that one meeting, will be an opportunity for the President to put politics aside and have an opportunity to talk about the values that he and the Pope have in common.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a very important cardinal who said that the Pope is going to enter the United States \xe2\x80\x9cas migrant.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0According to the Catholic News Service, immigration will be one of the most important themes of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Pope speak for himself, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have an opportunity to describe his views on a range of topics. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him do that. \xc2\xa0I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on many of these issues is quite well known to everybody in this room, whether it comes to fighting for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform in this country, or ensuring that the United States steps up and continues to play a leading role in responding to the basic humanitarian needs of those fleeing violence from Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, the United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance. \xc2\xa0That assistance is now up to $4.5 billion in terms of the financial contributions that the U.S. government has made to ongoing relief efforts in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s $1.6 billion this fiscal year alone. \xc2\xa0And I think it reflects not just the commitment of the United States, but also the values of the American people to try to assist and make a substantial contribution to the effort to meet the basic humanitarian needs of those fellow human beings that are in a rather desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what will happen if the Pope asks the President to welcome more migrants in the United States?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge what may happen tomorrow, but you will recall that last week, or maybe it was the week before, we made an announcement that the United States, upon the direct orders of the President, plans to take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year. \xc2\xa0And you saw the announcement from Secretary Kerry about the stepped-up efforts of the United States to take refugees from all over the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before that there is a very specific United Nations designation when it comes to refugees. \xc2\xa0And in recent years, the United States has taken in more refugees through the United Nations in that specific category of United Nations-designated individuals than the rest of the world combined.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is clear that the United States, certainly under the leadership of President Obama, understands the important role that the United States can and should play when it comes to trying to address the needs of those who are less fortunate, particularly those who are in such a desperate situation that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to flee their homes because of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, in front of the Pope in Cuba, Raul Castro\xe2\x80\x99s speech included a demand that the United States returns Guantanamo Bay to Cuba. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to discuss this a couple of times, but that certainly is not part of the policy that we envision.</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0I just want to -- again, the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit, on a different perspective. \xc2\xa0I just wanted to know from you, what\xe2\x80\x99s the feeling in the White House, behind those walls? \xc2\xa0Is it just another guest, another eminent guest coming to the White House? \xc2\xa0Is the President excited? \xc2\xa0We understand the respect you have for him, his values, his life. \xc2\xa0But in the White House, how do people feel receiving the Pope this time? \xc2\xa0Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the city -- I mean I was here for Benedict the XVI, and it was not the same feeling. \xc2\xa0The atmosphere was totally different.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, certainly there is a lot of respect and admiration for Pope Francis and for the message of love and inclusion that he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring with him when he travels to the United States later today. \xc2\xa0But Pope Francis has also served as an inspiration to so many people -- both Catholics and non-Catholics alike. \xc2\xa0And I think that is what accounts for the kind of palpable excitement that you see not just all across the city, but even in the halls of this building. \xc2\xa0And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Catholic, but certainly I would include myself in the broad category of those who have been genuinely inspired by the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s words, his message and his actions to live out the kinds of values that he preaches.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States -- or the White House is the destination for many world leaders, many of whom are good friends and allies and have earned the deep respect of the American people. \xc2\xa0But I do think, with all due respect to those other world leaders, I think the Pope is a singular figure and he has really stirred the souls of people all around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd people here in the White House who -- people who work in the White House do -- many people who work in the White House do this job because they also have values that have deeply influenced the kind of work that they pursue on a daily basis. \xc2\xa0And that there are people who work at the National Security Council or who work at the National Economic Council, who work at the Office of Management and Budget, in some cases these are highly technical jobs, but by and large, these are individuals who, despite their technical expertise -- and even if it means they spend most of their time behind their computer, they\'re spending a lot of time at the office, sometimes away from their family because they\'re animated by the same kinds of values that animate the Pope.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think that\'s why the opportunity to have Pope Francis, somebody who shares those values, here in this building tomorrow makes for a really special day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you\'ve been here since the beginning. \xc2\xa0With the Pope and President Xi Jinping coming right after, is it the most busy week you will have gone through? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- my colleagues in the Social Office would say that that\'s the case. \xc2\xa0From a formal arrival ceremony for Pope Francis tomorrow, the formal arrival ceremony for President Xi just two days later on Friday morning, and then a state dinner on Friday evening, to say nothing of all of the work that goes into planning for all the dignitaries who are in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for you to assume that my colleagues over in the Social Office are well aware of the microscope that they\'re under right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tDeesha Dyer is the recently named Social Secretary here at the White House, so she certainly is getting a baptism by fire. \xc2\xa0No pun intended. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I took a little while for you guys to get that joke, I guess, huh? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But I have no doubt that she is going to -- that she and her team are going to perform admirably, and that both Pope Francis and President Xi will feel the warm welcome and deep respect not just of the American people but also of the President and the First Lady.</p>\n<p>\n\tKelly, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Staying with the Pope for a moment, and then I have a second question. \xc2\xa0If you could take us in the room a bit, do you expect that they will have their conversation in English, which is not the Holy Father\xe2\x80\x99s preferred language? \xc2\xa0Or would you expect it to be translated? \xc2\xa0And is there a gift that\'s planned from the First Family to His Holiness?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As you\'ve seen when the President has received world leaders here at the White House there typically is a diplomatic gift exchange. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that that will take place tomorrow. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any details about what that gift is, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details on that for you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the actual meeting, I don\'t know whether or not it will be conducted in English or in Spanish. \xc2\xa0But once that meeting has taken place, we can try to confirm those kinds of details for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on another topic, with the environment being part of the backdrop here, last weekend in Concord, New Hampshire, Secretary Clinton talked about Keystone and her need to make a decision and to make that public, and putting the White House on notice, feeling that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We noticed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- as she described it, that she has given time to the administration, but that she could not wait much longer, were her words. \xc2\xa0What is the status of a decision? \xc2\xa0What sort of formal notice did she provide to the White House? \xc2\xa0What can you tell us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any formal notice that was provided to the White House, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that any formal notice is necessary. \xc2\xa0This is a policy process that continues to be underway over at the State Department. \xc2\xa0And for updates in terms of the timeframe in which a decision will be reached, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about something you said earlier. \xc2\xa0You said it felt like the President and the Holy Father had a lot in common, they had a lot of shared values. \xc2\xa0Can you sort of unpack that for me a little bit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me do the best I can on this. \xc2\xa0I think the best way to describe this to you is that both men have talked quite publicly about their commitment to social justice and both men have dedicated not just their careers but their lives to that effort. \xc2\xa0Certainly the kind of commitment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Pope Francis is unique and singular, but I think the values that both men live out have some common ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama, after graduating from law school, turned down offers from high-paying law firms on the East Coast, and traveled to Chicago and spent time on the South Side of Chicago in a community that had been going through some significant economic turmoil, and a lot of people losing their jobs, a lot of families being separated -- a community that was really in need, and the President worked in that community to try to help rebuild it. \xc2\xa0And the President actually worked quite closely with other Catholics in that community, and the President has talked about that quite a bit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make here is that this has been a value that has animated the President\xe2\x80\x99s career choices since he was a young man and long before he\xe2\x80\x99d become famous. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a similar story to tell about Pope Francis -- that prior to rising through the leadership ranks of the Catholic Church that Pope Francis earned a reputation in Latin America for somebody who was willing to roll up his sleeves and try to meet the needs of those who are less fortunate, particularly those who were economically destitute. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think what is -- one of the things that I think so captured the imagination of people around the world is the way that Pope Francis has strived to try to continue that humility and that kind of commitment, even in an office as celebrated as the Papacy. \xc2\xa0And, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that has inspired so many people about the Pope. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s dedication to these kinds of issues are singular, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody can claim to have the kind of dedication to these issues that the Pope has displayed. \xc2\xa0But certainly I think that you can say that both President Obama and Pope Francis have, over the course of their careers, both demonstrated a commitment to values related to social and economic justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about a report from China that an American business person, Phan Phan-Gillis, has been arrested and has been accused of a number of crimes there. \xc2\xa0Do you have an update or a White House response to that report?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We have seen these reports, Kevin, and this is something that the United States State Department has been working on for quite some time. \xc2\xa0Shortly after her initial detention, State Department officials were in touch with Chinese officials raising questions about her detention. \xc2\xa0And since then, in a variety of formats and at a variety of levels, both in China and here in the United States, some direct questions have been asked of Chinese officials about her status.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s disconcerting to the administration is that many of those questions have gone unanswered. \xc2\xa0And I can tell you that today, just earlier today, the White House was in touch with the Chinese Foreign Ministry to continue to ask these direct questions about her current status and to insist that all of the rules are followed that govern her access to her attorneys and providing her appropriate information about her status. \xc2\xa0But other than that -- for additional details about this, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would it be fair to say this casts, at least in some ways, a pall on the coming visit of President Xi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, I certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that it would come up in the conversation between the two leaders. \xc2\xa0As I pointed out, the United States at a variety of levels, both in China and in the United States, has asked direct questions about her status that, thus far, have gone unanswered by Chinese officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To go back to a General John Allen -- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to confirm whether or not he is stepping down, but that story also quoted several military officials that have kind of had the same theme -- the theme of being under-resourced and specific challenges in Syria and the fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0And we heard from General Petraeus the same theme -- that the U.S. has not done enough to invest resources in the fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can comment on that theme that we\xe2\x80\x99re not investing where we should in terms of the resources going into the fight against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think I would just say that we have been quite clear about what exactly the strategy is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And General Allen has played an important role in that strategy, because at the core of that strategy is the assembly of a coalition of 62 nations to implement it, and that is a much broader coalition with members who are more intimately involved in this effort than any of us would have predicted a year ago. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament, first and foremost, to the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, but it certainly is a testament to the effectiveness that General Allen has displayed in his current role.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important is you\xe2\x80\x99re citing military officials who -- I guess most of whom anonymously -- are offering some critique. \xc2\xa0The President has made quite clear that, A, there is no military solution to the challenges that are plaguing Syria, and that, B, our strategy encompasses a whole lot more than just military might. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, certainly the use of U.S. and coalition military airpower has been incredibly effective in driving ISIL out of areas of both Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0And we have been able to cooperate quite effectively with both forces on the ground that are taking the fight to ISIL, particularly Iraqi security forces, and that has allowed us to make some progress. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been in a situation where we have been able to engage in counter-financing efforts. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to engage the international coalition in efforts to stop the flow -- or at least reduce the flow of fighters, if not shut it down entirely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all of these are efforts that require the United States to use our influence through diplomacy, through technical expertise related to the financial system and others to advance our goal. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that over the last year or so, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work that remains to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just bouncing off that, General Petraeus said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not where we should be at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Do you disagree with that in terms of the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there certainly -- I guess the fact that I said that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more important work that needs to get done I think should be an indication to you that there\xe2\x80\x99s progress that we still hope that we can make in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I can switch topics to the impending potential government shutdown. \xc2\xa0The Senate I think is going to vote on a CR that would continue to fund the government through the end of the year, through December, but it would strip that funding for Planned Parenthood -- potentially, I guess, shift it over to other community health centers. \xc2\xa0Do you have a response to that strategy from the Senate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the specific piece of legislation that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward, but I think the first place to ask your question is actually to Democrats in Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, I think the one thing that is crystal-clear to everybody, including the Republican leadership in Congress, is that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to succeed in passing budget legislation strictly along party lines. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to cooperate with Democrats in order to reach the kind of agreement that would prevent a government shutdown and ensure that our national security and economic priorities are adequately funded. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more on General Campbell, the statement in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0I get the sense that from that statement, the General is saying that things should go up through the chain of command and there\xe2\x80\x99s no policy against reporting these things. \xc2\xa0But it seems like in The New York Times story, there were soldiers who were punished for actually intervening at the time and stopping this abuse from happening. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a sense from the statement whether or not that punishment would continue -- people who intervened rather than just reporting would be punished, and if that\xe2\x80\x99s the new stance from the administration -- soldiers will be allowed to intervene and stop this from happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just read you the relevant paragraph from his statement, where he says, \xe2\x80\x9cRecent media reports citing alleged cases from 2010, 2011 and 2012 have claimed that in the past, a command policy existed within the Afghan theater of operations that U.S. forces were to ignore suspicions of sexual abuse committed by Afghans against children.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0General Campbell said that, \xe2\x80\x9cI personally have served multiple tours of duty in Afghanistan and am absolutely confident that no such theater policy has ever existed here, and certainly no such policy has existed throughout my tenure as commander.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as it relates to the cases of individual soldiers, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about that from here. \xc2\xa0You can talk to the Department of Defense about that. \xc2\xa0But what General Campbell I think has stated rather unequivocally here is what his expectations are of U.S. military personnel who encounter these kinds of situations.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to actually go back to one other thing that related to the ISIL effort that I think is relevant to the kind of progress that we can highlight at this point. \xc2\xa0And this is something that was just announced by the Pentagon that I\xe2\x80\x99m following up on here. \xc2\xa0The Pentagon today has confirmed that al Qaeda operative and explosive expert David Drugeon was killed in a coalition airstrike on July 5th, 2015 near Aleppo, Syria. \xc2\xa0Mr. Drugeon was a French national and was a member of a network of veteran al Qaeda operatives occasionally called the Khorasan Group. \xc2\xa0He was an explosive expert who trained other extremists in Syria and sought to plan external attacks against Western targets.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Department of Defense also announced today that ISIL senior leader Abu Bakr al-Turkmani was killed in a coalition strike on September 10 near Tal Afar, Iraq. \xc2\xa0Mr. Turkmani was a legacy al Qaeda-in-Iraq jihadist before he joined ISIL. \xc2\xa0He was a close associate to multiple ISIL senior leaders in the Mosul and Tal Afar, Iraq area. \xc2\xa0His death will serve to disrupt ISIL operations in Tal Afar, impacting the terrorist group\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to maneuver in ISIL-controlled areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think this is evidence of the kind of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re making against ISIL and other extremists that are operating in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0This is not an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything we need to do. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s still more work that needs to get done. \xc2\xa0But this is an example of the kind of progress and the kind of pressure that the United States and our coalition partners are applying to ISIL and to other extremists that are seeking to harm the United States and our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrancesca.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0This predates my time at the White House and I know it predates your time at the podium, but back on Petraeus -- do you know if he ever apologized to the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the details of any private conversations that Mr. Petraeus may have had with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And while you\xe2\x80\x99ve been up at the podium -- so I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to read a little bit to you because I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this, necessarily -- but Mike Huckabee has been on Twitter today. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit upset.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sounds dangerous. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s been on Twitter today and he\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit upset about the reception that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing with the Pope tomorrow at the White House. \xc2\xa0And a few of the key things that he said was that \xe2\x80\x9cObama admin respected bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s dead body under Muslim tradition. \xc2\xa0Why no respect for Pope and Catholics?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPOTUS bowed to a Saudi king and a Japanese emperor. \xc2\xa0Why no respect for Pontifics and Catholics?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So I wanted to know if you have any reaction to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: I don\'t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I just wanted to ask you some questions about the fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0You cited a number that I believe you cited numerous times here in the Briefing Room of the number of coalition partners that are taking the fight against ISIS, and you said 62 coalition partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe that\'s the correct number.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give a sense about that number, 62? \xc2\xa0Because we don\'t hear a lot about what those other nations are doing. \xc2\xa0Are they primarily involved in a military effort? \xc2\xa0Or is it primarily counter-financing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This would actually be a good question for General Allen and his office. \xc2\xa0General Allen has the responsibility to work in a diplomatic role with nations around the world that are ready to contribute to the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0He also plays an important role in facilitating the efforts of those countries to integrate their efforts into the broader efforts of our coalition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what I would just say -- he can answer it in much more specific fashion than I can. \xc2\xa0What I can say is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about the multifaceted strategy that we have designed and implemented against ISIL, and this certainly includes the use of military airpower. \xc2\xa0That is the aspect of our strategy that gets the most attention. \xc2\xa0And it is also the aspect of our strategy that yields important results like the deaths of these two leading extremists that I just mentioned. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that that gets so much attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten significant contributions from a significant number of countries to those kinds of efforts. \xc2\xa0I think the best example I can cite for you is that there was initially and understandably skepticism about whether or not Muslim-majority nations would join the United States in taking airstrikes against ISIL targets inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, there are a number of our Gulf partners who have been active participants in that effort, and we certainly have welcomed the important contribution that they have made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ve also made some sacrifices as a result. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked at one point about the detention and death of a Jordanian pilot who was engaged in those operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s an indication of the depth of the contribution that countries in the coalition are making to the military effort. \xc2\xa0But some of those countries are also engaged in other aspects of our strategy. \xc2\xa0This is the counter-finance strategy that you alluded to. \xc2\xa0This certainly is an important role for many countries in the region to play when it comes to trying to counter the online radicalization strategy that ISIL has pursued to try to inspire other people around the world to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have welcomed the kind of support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from countries around the globe in trying to stem the flow of foreign fighters to the region. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten significant contributions from a range of countries for this training-and-equipping effort. \xc2\xa0That includes both the effort that\'s underway to train and equip some members of the moderate Syrian opposition. \xc2\xa0That also applies to the train-and-equip effort that\'s underway of Iraqi security forces in Iraq. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also been important logistical support to many of those efforts that have been provided by members of the coalition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\'re asking an important question about the wide variety of ways that people who are part of this coalition -- nations that are part of this coalition can contribute to this effort, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only because of that commitment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from these countries that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make as much progress as we have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you ever put out -- or put together a list of those 62 countries? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it and I\xe2\x80\x99d love to get a look at that. \xc2\xa0And sort of with that list, cite what each country is actually doing in terms of that effort to defeat and destroy ISIS?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is possible that there are some limitations on what can be made public. \xc2\xa0But certainly we can provide you a list of the nations that are part of the coalition. \xc2\xa0And if there are specific countries that you have questions about, hopefully we can at least give you a sense of what their contribution is. \xc2\xa0But General Allen\xe2\x80\x99s office would be the best place for you to take those questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two brief questions. \xc2\xa0When you mentioned the many values that the President and the Holy Father have in common, you mentioned prioritizing those less fortunate. \xc2\xa0Would that column for discussion include the plight of Christians in the Middle East, notably from Syria and Iraq who have been forced to flee for practicing their faith? \xc2\xa0This is something many leaders of the Catholic Church have highlighted lately -- notably the Archbishop of Iraq, who was recently here in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, John, I certainly would include in the category of values they share in common is a commitment to religious liberty and certainly standing up for the rights of religious minorities around the world. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about how one of the things, particularly early on in this ISIL campaign, was there was a concerted effort on the part of the United States military to make sure that we were taking actions to try to protect religious minorities in Iraq. \xc2\xa0So that has long been a value that President Obama has prioritized.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t know, frankly, whether or not this is something that will be discussed by the two leaders in the Oval Office or not. \xc2\xa0But it certainly gives me an opportunity to talk about another value that they share in common.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0And my other question is, given the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement about allowing 10,000 refugees in the United States and then Secretary Kerry calling for 100,000 yesterday, does the administration also have a plan along the lines of Operation Safe Haven, which was the plan in 1956 that the U.S. had that brought in political refugees from Hungary fleeing communism, and allowing them eventually to become citizens through mastery of English and military service in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s the question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My question is, does the administration have a plan similar to Operate Save Haven for Syrians that was used to bring in Hungarian refugees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer your question a couple different ways. \xc2\xa0The first is, the 10,000 number refers to what the President has described is the minimum number of Syrian refugees that he would like to see brought into the United States in the next fiscal year. \xc2\xa0The 100,000 number that Secretary Kerry was talking about actually applies to fiscal year 2017 and it applies to the overall number of refugees admitted to the United States from anywhere else in the world. \xc2\xa0So those are sort of two different numbers that and I just want to make sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s some clarity about what those numbers describe.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the details of what refugees to the United States have to do in order to eventually qualify for citizenship, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department. \xc2\xa0There is an established process -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy one, but it is a long-established process for this. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is one of the things that -- again, this is one of the things that characterizes and distinguishes U.S. generosity. \xc2\xa0There are many other countries who, when they take in refugees into their country, that they are essentially put on notice that they are only there temporarily until they can be returned home. \xc2\xa0Refugees are afforded a somewhat different status here in the United States and many of them are given the opportunity if they take the prescribed steps to eventually qualify for citizenship. \xc2\xa0And, again, I think that sort of reflects the history of our nation and the fact that other than the Native Americans among us, that all of us have ancestors who came to this country as immigrants.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharlie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday, Governor Scott Walker dropped out of the Republican primary. \xc2\xa0And I know the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t following the race closely, but he has singled the Governor out for criticism in the past, and I wondered if he has a reaction to that news.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that he does. \xc2\xa0There certainly has been a lot of speculation and analysis from those of you who are following the race closely about Governor Walker\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t add my own analysis to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And any reaction from the White House regarding reports that the Syrian trained rebels turned over their weapons and went to al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that specific report, but you can check with the Department of Defense against that.</p>\n<p>\n\tDrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple questions on Syria. \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. government have any indication that Russia is preparing to deploy assets to additional military sites in Syria, namely Istamo weapons storage complex and the Al-Sanobar military complex.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Andrew, I cannot confirm those reports. \xc2\xa0We certainly are aware that Russia continues to ship a variety of materials and weapons to Syria, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made quite clear that it would be destabilizing and unproductive for Russia to continue to use that military firepower to back Assad. \xc2\xa0The President was quite clear in saying that he believed that a Russian decision to double down on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s leadership is a losing bet. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so it continues to be true that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s precise intentions inside of Syria are not clear. \xc2\xa0But we continue to be interested in Russia sending a signal about their willingness to constructively support the international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0They say that that is a goal that they share, and we would welcome the kinds of actions that reflect that rhetoric.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What Russia is doing in Syria -- there seems to be a bit more clarity, as the Secretary of State has just said, that some of the aircraft deployed to Latakia was purely to protect the base. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how ground attack, aircraft and fighter aircraft would be used to protect a base. \xc2\xa0I mean, it seems like a rather offensive system.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about sort of the latest analysis about what material is there and what it may or may not be used for. \xc2\xa0We continue to urge the Russians to find a way to constructively support the international coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s been assembled to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0Russia has been quite clear about sharing that goal. \xc2\xa0But further supporting the Assad regime through the use of military force would contradict that goal and, in fact, undermine the ongoing international effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason for that is ISIL has been able to gain strength in the midst of the chaos that was sown by President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe a democratic transition -- a political transition inside of Syria needs to occur. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States continues to be strongly supportive of efforts to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a final question on China. \xc2\xa0When Xi Jinping visits on Friday, would you expect the President to voice concerns about Chinese NGO law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0About the Chinese --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0NGO law -- the draft NGO law that would force organizations working in China to register with the State Security Services.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are a number of policies that the Chinese government has implemented, often in the name of national security, that have prompted concern by the United States. \xc2\xa0And in the same way that President Obama routinely raises concerns about Chinese behavior in cyberspace, in every interaction that he has with Chinese officials, President Obama makes clear that respect for the universal human rights of the Chinese people is something that the Chinese government should also prioritize. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will have an opportunity in the context of this state visit to once again raise concerns about China\xe2\x80\x99s human rights record and the tendency that they have to implement policies that don\xe2\x80\x99t show proper respect for those human rights, and that, frankly, some of their claims about national security considerations are not sufficient explanations for the steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you emphasized that Republicans in Congress need to work with Democrats in Congress to sort out this budget situation over the next few days, and obviously your answer about the social calendar, -- the President really probably could not be more occupied over the next few days. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s his role at this point, given that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that Republicans need to work primarily with congressional Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the first observation is that Republicans have, for months, rebuffed the invitation from Democrats on Capitol Hill to engage in these discussions. \xc2\xa0And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly have to be clairvoyant to predict that we\xe2\x80\x99d be a week before a government shutdown deadline and Republicans still scrambling to figure out how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep the government open. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe, for months now, have been discussing what that path is. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that Republicans will not succeed in passing budget legislation only along party lines. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to work in bipartisan fashion. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to work with Democrats to build bipartisan support for legislation so that it can advance through both the House and the Senate, and land on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that at some point, Republicans will begin to engage in those discussions. \xc2\xa0If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that Republicans for that second time in two years will have engineered a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0And that is not something that I think the American people are going to look on too kindly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry, my question was what the President\xe2\x80\x99s role is over the next few days.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I think what you can expect the administration will continue to do is to encourage both sides to come together for talks. \xc2\xa0If those talks begin, you can certainly expect that the Obama administration will offer technical support and we\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in those discussions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, if those discussions occur, if administration officials are in the room, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be sitting on the same side of the table as Democrats. \xc2\xa0We certainly share the kinds of priorities that Democrats have sought to champion in the budget process that ensures that both our national security and our economic needs are adequately funded. \xc2\xa0But at this point, those talks haven\xe2\x80\x99t started yet. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a disappointment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President need to be in some capacity at the negotiating table before he returns a week from now from the United Nations General Assembly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, not necessarily. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that the discussions need to wait for the President for any reason. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of ways to ensure that the President remains in the loop on those discussions without the President sitting at the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tFred, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0With respect to Planned Parenthood funding and the possible shutdown there, if that money is re-diverted over to community health centers -- first question on that -- what would be the main reason for opposing that? \xc2\xa0Because apparently health care funding would not be cut. \xc2\xa0And secondly, would it be worth risking a government shutdown just to protect funding for one organization?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Fred, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear is that Planned Parenthood is an organization that provides health care to millions of families all across the country and they do not use any of their taxpayer funding to perform abortions. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s expressly prohibited by law, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a law that\xe2\x80\x99s been enforced by the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Republican effort to shift funding away from Planned Parenthood would take away access to health care that millions of Americans rely on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if it went to other community health care centers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It would, because there are Planned Parenthood facilities whose very existence would be threatened by the stripping of this funding. \xc2\xa0More importantly, Fred, there\xe2\x80\x99s no legitimate explanation that anybody in Congress can offer up for that tactic. \xc2\xa0They say that it\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99re opposed to abortion, but no taxpayer funds are used to perform abortions. \xc2\xa0That is a law that\xe2\x80\x99s been on the books for quite some time and it\xe2\x80\x99s a law that\xe2\x80\x99s been enforced by the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that there are Republicans that are trying to gain a political advantage of one sort or another by championing this issue. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is not in the best interest of our economy; it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of expanding -- protecting access to health care for the American people. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans go to great lengths to try to prevent the American people from getting access to health care. \xc2\xa0Why they support that is beyond me, but it certainly is something that may garner a short-term political benefit for some members of the United States Congress, but it certainly is not going to be in the broader interest of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President will definitely veto any -- if the CR did make it to his desk without Planned Parenthood funding, he would definitely --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has made clear that he is strongly opposed and would not sign legislation that would result in the wholesale defunding of Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0But as you point out, Fred, there is no indication that that piece of legislation would even arrive at the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.</p>\n<p>\n\tColleen, I saw you had your hand up. \xc2\xa0Do you want to do the last one?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Has the White House made a determination on whether a meeting with Putin would be productive? \xc2\xa0And should we expect that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have some sort of interaction next week, or is it a possibility that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I discussed before that the President will only be in New York for a short period of time and so his schedule will be filled with a variety of meetings and events. \xc2\xa0I assume that President Putin will have a similarly busy schedule when he arrives in New York as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet whether or not their paths will cross, but once we have a better sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule looks like and whether or not that includes a meeting with President Putin, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:15 P.M.
