Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:52 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the Iowa caucuses last night.\xc2\xa0 Was he glad to see Donald Trump defeated?\xc2\xa0 Was he concerned to see the amount of support that Ted Cruz garnered in the Republican primary -- caucus?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I did not have a chance to talk to the President about the caucus results last night, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to disappoint you on that front.\xc2\xa0 I think, in general, what I can share with you is that for at least a generation, Republican candidates aspiring to work in this building have tried to claim the mantle of President Reagan.\xc2\xa0 While they\xe2\x80\x99ve sought to claim his mantle, they have utterly failed in trying to claim his message of sunny optimism -- at least this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a campaign that\xe2\x80\x99s been characterized by candidates trying to exploit people\xe2\x80\x99s fears and anxieties and insecurities about the future.\xc2\xa0 And those candidates ended up doing pretty well last night.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s why a lot of Democrats wake up this morning, at least at this point, not particularly concerned about the potential match-up that we would face in a general election when you consider that all of the candidates are now under more pressure than ever to sort of adopt this pessimism and darkness in terms of assessing the future of the greatest country on planet Earth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Democrats, on the other hand, have been pretty forward-leaning, talking about the opportunity that exists for middle-class families, and the need to put in place policies in Washington, D.C. that actually will do more for the middle class. And that draws the outlines of a general election whose outcome bodes quite well for Democrats.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of people here at the White House are obviously very interested and engaged in seeing a Democratic successor to this President.\xc2\xa0 Looking at the results of the Democratic caucuses last night, is there concern here at the White House that a drawn-out slugfest between Hillary Clinton and an upstart candidate who is doing very well with young people could be difficult for the party or weaken the party\xe2\x80\x99s eventual nominee, heading into the general election?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Josh, even in framing your question you\xe2\x80\x99re sort of noting some of the echoes to 2008.\xc2\xa0 I think while it\xe2\x80\x99s not a perfect analogy, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an apt comparison.\xc2\xa0 And many people worried about the same thing in 2008, about Senator Obama and Senator Clinton getting sucked into a long, bloody, drawn-out primary campaign that could hurt the general election candidate -- or hurt the Democrats in a general election.\xc2\xa0 It turned out that the opposite was true -- that the drawn-out primary campaign in 2008 had the effect of sharpening and improving the skills of both candidates on the stump and on the debate stage.\xc2\xa0 It had the effect of forcing Democratic campaigns in just about all 50 states to build up a turnout operation that yielded important benefits in the general election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of my colleagues who were focused on the ground operation that said that the aggressively competitive Democratic primary in the state of Indiana -- I believe Election Day in 2008 in the primary in Indiana was in May, so sort of something that was basically unprecedented in at least the modern political schedule -- led directly to the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to win Indiana in the general election.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the case in 2016, but those concerns in 2008 were unfounded.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the potential that you could find in 2016 that a message that has -- or a campaign and a debate that has clearly energized Democrats in Iowa -- and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see energized Democrats in New Hampshire, too -- that having this campaign go to some other states would have the effect of energizing some Democrats in other states that eventually would be beneficial to whichever candidate emerges as the Democratic nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to the meetings here today at the White House, the President and congressional leaders.\xc2\xa0 I know that at least the lunch portion of the agenda is probably still going on, but from the earlier portion with McConnell and Ryan, do you have any early readout you can give us or sense of what the leaders spoke about?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can give you sort of a brief overview of their discussion.\xc2\xa0 The President spent some time sort of highlighting five of the priorities that he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that we can work with Congress on this year.\xc2\xa0 The first of those is addressing the crisis in Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 I know that Speaker Ryan and other leaders in the House of Representatives have committed to taking action in the first quarter of this year to try to give government authorities in Puerto Rico more tools that they can use to address the financial challenges that are facing Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second topic of discussion was ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 Both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell are obviously committed supporters of an agreement that would cut taxes on 18,000 American goods that are imposed by other countries.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to discuss the path forward there, and obviously the President is eager to see Congress take that action as soon as possible this year so that the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses and American workers can start enjoying the benefits of that agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was also a discussion of additional steps that the administration and Congress can take to fight the opioid epidemic.\xc2\xa0 Heroin abuse is actually something that has gotten a lot of discussion on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 And you may have seen the announcement from the White House earlier today about the additional resources that we would like to commit to fighting heroin abuse in communities large and small all across the country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly been pleased to see this issue get a lot of bipartisan attention in the context of the presidential race, particularly in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 So today seemed like an appropriate day for us to talk about some of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plans for confronting that significant challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two other things that I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday there was the meeting of administration officials to discuss the cancer moonshot initiative that the Vice President is leading.\xc2\xa0 There has been interest expressed by Republicans in Congress to supporting that effort, and that was discussed today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then of course they talked about criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of bipartisan discussions take place on that issue, frankly, for more than a year now, so it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising that that came up in the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just before he came over here this morning, Speaker Ryan was saying that basically the best thing about the Iowa caucuses last night was that it signaled the start of the end of the Barack Obama presidency.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering what the outlook from a lot of Republicans that they\xe2\x80\x99re basically trying to run out the clock on this administration -- does that bode well for compromise or some progress on the issues that you just mentioned?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate question when you consider that the President is not going to be on the ballot in 2016.\xc2\xa0 But all the Republicans in the House of Representatives are going to be, and a third of the United States Senate is going to be on the ballot, too.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a lot of voters who are asking those members of Congress exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for the last two years and what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to earn their vote, particularly when you consider that Republicans, with a lot of fanfare, captured strong majorities in both Houses of Congress in the last election and I think a lot of voters are going to be asking incumbents what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99ve done with that privilege.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so this goes to something that I mentioned a little bit last week.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of coverage lately of some Republicans on Capitol Hill -- not a majority, but some Republicans on Capitol Hill -- signaling a desire to undermine potential bipartisan cooperation between Republicans on Capitol Hill and Democrats in the White House -- and whether that is approving TPP, or working on criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, understandably, covered by many in the news media as a rejection of the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously would like to see those two things advanced, and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to be invested in trying to advance those two priorities in our legislative agenda.\xc2\xa0 But it begs the question about what exactly is on the Republican legislative agenda.\xc2\xa0 The only thing that we can reliably count on appearing on the Republican legislative agenda are repeated attempts to repeal Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are poised to host another vote in the United States Congress today, for the 60th time, to repeal Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like it\xe2\x80\x99s Groundhog Day -- except that today it actually is Groundhog Day, and they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure that qualifies as the contours of a proactive legislative agenda.\xc2\xa0 But it does put some pressure on Speaker Ryan, Leader McConnell, and other Republicans in Congress to lay out what it is exactly they support, and try to find some common ground with the administration.\xc2\xa0 We certainly have done that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that some of the items that we have prioritized are things that they strongly support in their own right.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find willing partners on Capitol Hill to advance those measures.\xc2\xa0 I think that is certainly the expectation of most voters across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ayesha.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So moving on to another topic.\xc2\xa0 Today some top U.S. generals told lawmakers at the Senate Armed Service Committee -- Armed Services Committee hearing that women should be required to register for the draft.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, is that an official White House position at this point?\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that women should be required to register for the draft?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is not an official administration position. I believe that those military leaders were asked their personal opinion on that.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange firsthand.\xc2\xa0 But there is no policy change to announce from here today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you considering it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of how seriously this is being studied by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 I know that there have been some members of Congress that have advocated for expanding Selective Service to include women registering, as well.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those kinds of proposals floated, but I don\'t know how seriously that is being considered.\xc2\xa0 You might check with the Department of Defense to get a steer on it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, they\xe2\x80\x99ve notified some U.N. agencies that the country plans to launch a satellite later this month, and this could be an attempt to advance the country\xe2\x80\x99s development of long-range missile technology.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House about this latest announcement?\xc2\xa0 And does the international community -- does the U.S. need to move faster to get more sanctions on North Korea to kind of stop these actions that could be considered provocative?\xc2\xa0 Or is something more than sanctions needed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the international community -- I feel confident in telling you that the international community would regard a step like that by the North Koreans as just another irresponsible provocation and a clear violation of their international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have been working with the international community, both at the U.N. and with our allies and partners in the region, to confront North Korea for their destabilizing activities.\xc2\xa0 Just a few weeks ago they conducted a nuclear test that violated sort of their basic international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And carrying out a satellite launch like the one that has been discussed publicly would just be another destabilizing provocation on the part of the North Koreans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not just the view of the United States.\xc2\xa0 I feel confident in telling you that is a view that is shared by our partners at the United Nations Security Council and by our allies and partners in the region that had been seeking to stabilize and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there anything that can be done to stop these actions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States has worked closely not just with our allies in South Korea and Japan, but also with our partners in China and Russia, to convey to the North Koreans the need to end their provocative actions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are a range of options that have been on the table.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly have, in our conversations at a diplomatic level with the Chinese in particular, encouraged them to continue to work with us and develop potential options.\xc2\xa0 And obviously China is in a unique position.\xc2\xa0 They have unique influence over the North Korean regime.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are pleased to be able to work cooperatively and effectively with the Chinese to counter this threat.\xc2\xa0 And that work will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t, at this point, announced any specific response to the North Korean nuclear test, but that certainly has been the subject of intense diplomacy over the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 And once we have developed an appropriate response and are prepared to implement it with our allies and partners, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared to talk about it with you then.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, were you in the meeting with Ryan and McConnell?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was not.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the readout you gave us was just based on what the agenda -- you knew the agenda to be?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And based on a conversation that somebody on my staff had with somebody who was in the meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to be able to give us any more about the tone of the talks today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s more detail that we can dig out for you, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, yesterday the Treasury Department posted that the national debt topped $19 trillion -- $8.3 trillion of that was -- soared during President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s watch. \xc2\xa0Is this something that the President is concerned about as part of his legacy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark, the measure that we are focused on is the percentage of debt to GDP.\xc2\xa0 And the best way for us to confront that is to actually start driving down the deficit as a percentage of GDP.\xc2\xa0 And under the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, we have actually reduced that measure 75 percent because of this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- at least in fiscal year 2015 and in the last couple of years -- succeeded in driving the deficit-to-GDP ratio below 3 percent.\xc2\xa0 That is the measure that economists tell us over the long term will stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the statistic that we follow most closely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think in the budget proposal that we\xe2\x80\x99ll put forward, the longer-term vision that the President has is to continue to keep the debt at a relatively stable level as a percent of our GDP.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My understanding is the debt is over 100 percent of GDP, that gross total debt at $19 trillion.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an enormous amount.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that is sustainable?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what we\'re seeking to do is to try to limit the growth of the debt as a percentage of GDP. And that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been so focused on driving down the deficit. And that\'s why, frankly, the President is pretty proud of the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in reducing the deficit by 75 percent since he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is certainly a measure that we\'re mindful of.\xc2\xa0 And look, to understand the long-term trends here we have to sort of take a look at what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 When the last Democratic President was leaving office, he was passing off budget surpluses as far as the eye could see to his successor.\xc2\xa0 His successor inherited that strong fiscal position and proceeded to put in place tax cuts that predominantly benefit the wealthy and the well-connected, and launched a ground war in the Middle East -- all without paying for it.\xc2\xa0 And that also led to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression that put enormous pressure on the federal budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd digging out of that economic downturn, leading our economy to recovery and doing it all in a fiscally responsible way will be a hallmark of the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Budget Office projects a $100 billion increase in the deficit for FY17.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that corresponds with OMB\xe2\x80\x99s projection?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen what OMB\xe2\x80\x99s projections are, but we can certainly check with you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We get it Tuesday anyway.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think it will be a part of the budget proposal that we\xe2\x80\x99ll put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Iowa.\xc2\xa0 You said how the winners of that were pessimistic, dark, all negative, so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think others have made that observation, but I have, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It also marked the rise of another candidate who is a young person who represents a different generation, who arguably has not been as dark and has been optimistic and sunny.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that, to Mr. Rubio?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mr. Rubio finished third and did so on the back of television ads saying that he no longer recognized his country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, it is difficult to differentiate among the messages from all of the candidates.\xc2\xa0 I think that people like Senator Rubio have felt an intense pressure to try to parrot the pessimism and darkness of the leading candidates on the Republican side.\xc2\xa0 And that does not position the party -- the Republican Party or the Republican Party nominee very well for a general election matchup in which they\xe2\x80\x99ll be squaring off against a Democratic candidate that\'s committed to building on the progress that this country has made under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans will be offering up a candidate that is pessimistic about the future and committed to taking our country back to exactly the kinds of policies that got us into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s why -- again, I think that\'s why a lot of Democrats wake up feeling pretty good about our presidential prospects this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the meeting, the Ryan-McConnell meeting, you said that the President had five things he wanted to highlight.\xc2\xa0 Did they have five things they wanted to highlight?\xc2\xa0 Or four things, or 10 things?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for a readout of what they came to present, you should check with them.\xc2\xa0 The five things that I noted that were on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and that the President brought up in the meeting are things that Republicans themselves say that they support.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t mean we agree on every single aspect of them, but surely there is opportunity to find common ground when trying to fight heroin addiction or trying to cure cancer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Republicans about what they\'re agenda is.\xc2\xa0 This was part of my response to Josh\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not really clear right now what their agenda is.\xc2\xa0 We certainly know what they\'re against.\xc2\xa0 We know they\'re against a health reform bill that has driven down the uninsured rate and driven down the growth in health care costs, to say nothing of the fact -- sort of alluding to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question -- repealing the Affordable Care Act would actually have a disastrous impact on the fiscal situation in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to Republicans about what exactly it is they\'re trying to advance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this early read, there\xe2\x80\x99s really -- you can\'t say anything more about where there might be some cooperation, an idea that they have that the President would run with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All five of these are things that they say that they agree with.\xc2\xa0 All five of these are ideas that they had.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past, but was that -- was there agreement on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, just to be blunt, out of respect for them, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them describe what they said in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not the spokesperson for Speaker Ryan or for Leader McConnell, and if they want to characterize their conversation with the President, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll defer to them to do that.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is that the proactive agenda that the President put forward included these five things, which are five things that they say that they support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of these are things that right now some of these Republican candidates who are on the campaign trail are actually trying to advance.\xc2\xa0 So, for example, fighting heroin addiction.\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t we lay the groundwork so that the next President has a running start in trying to address that specific challenge?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On TPP, where are we technically in terms -- can they bring it up at any time?\xc2\xa0 Or are we still on a waiting -- just so I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes,\xc2\xa0 it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated process.\xc2\xa0 We are not yet at a place where the President has forwarded the agreement to Congress for their ratification.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The signing ceremony for the Trans-Pacific Partnership I believe is actually scheduled for tomorrow in New Zealand.\xc2\xa0 This will be at the ministerial level.\xc2\xa0 The United States will officially agree to the agreement.\xc2\xa0 Part of the commitment that the President made was that we would give the American public ample opportunity to review the agreement before we signed it.\xc2\xa0 And so that will be taking place in New Zealand tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 After that, there are a couple of other steps before Congress has an opportunity to consider it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not standing up here and suggesting that Congress should act tomorrow to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 What I am saying is that once we go through this process and that there has been an opportunity for the public to carefully consider what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the agreement, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress act quickly on it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You must be aware that time -- where the line is that they have to act before or there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t at this point have a specific time frame to lay out.\xc2\xa0 As this process moves farther, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to characterize a little bit more clearly for you what the calendar would look like in terms of what sort of legislative steps would be required to ratify the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you have any more detail you can share with us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to this Islamic Society in Baltimore tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is certainly looking forward to his visit to this mosque in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 The President will begin his visit by sitting down for a roundtable discussion with some leaders in the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking for the opportunity to have some dialogue, to talk to leaders in the community about what\xe2\x80\x99s on their minds, what their concerns are.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly looking forward to that discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that the President will have an opportunity to speak to a broader audience at the mosque, and it will be an opportunity to do a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is to affirm the important role that Muslim Americans play in our society and to affirm our conviction in the principle of religious liberty, that law-abiding Americans should be able to worship God in the manner that they see fit, consistent with their religious heritage and traditions, in a way that doesn\'t subject them to either interference from the government or, frankly, divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is an important message, and the President is looking forward to delivering it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 is this -- in this message, is it a recognition that the President thinks profiling and discrimination against Muslims is a problem right now?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not theoretical, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reality?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the President\xe2\x80\x99s words speak for themselves tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has talked a lot about how important it is for the government to have an effective partnership with leaders in the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are extremist organizations like ISIL that are seeking to use social media to radicalize vulnerable members of the population.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the leaders in the Muslim community have a strong interest in preventing that from happening.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we will have more success in our efforts to prevent that if we work effectively with the Muslim community to confront that threat, as opposed to branding everybody who attends a mosque as a potential enemy of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 A, it\xe2\x80\x99s not true; and, B, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be counterproductive to our efforts to fight extremists.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this a personal appeal by the President to get Muslim leaders to help root out extremism when they see it in their own communities?\xc2\xa0 Is that a specific request from the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve made before, and you\'ll hear the President make again tomorrow, is that we already see that that\'s what leaders in Muslim communities are doing; that we do see that there are Muslim leaders in communities all across the country who are concerned about the pernicious influence of the radical ISIL ideology and they are looking to protect their community from that.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. government should work with them to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, I also don\'t want to leave you with the impression that the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at the mosque are going to be focused on national security.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is quite interested in making sure that we\'re affirming the important role that Muslims play in our diverse American society, and certainly affirming their right to worship God in a way that\'s consistent with their heritage.\xc2\xa0 And they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subject to ridicule or targeting by anybody, let alone somebody who aspires to leading the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since this is the President\xe2\x80\x99s first visit, do you expect anything to come out of it?\xc2\xa0 Are there proposals that the President is bringing, or is this just a conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t expect any policy proposals tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I would suspect that the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities tomorrow will prompt exactly the kind of discussion and debate that the President thinks is worth having.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 This one first.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the buildup of kind of anger or frustration that the President has seemed to have on this topic of the rhetoric against Muslims, dating back -- I don\'t know -- at least to when he was on the trip to Turkey, and all of the stuff came up with the Syrian refugees, and he seemed very eager to repeatedly come back to this topic again.\xc2\xa0 Does it go back further than that?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk a little bit about what -- sort of how this appears to be kind of a culmination of that sort of finger-wagging at the Republicans and the candidates about the kind of rhetoric that he just feels very strongly about?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is certainly true that we\'ve seen an alarming willingness on the part of some Republicans to try to marginalize law-abiding, patriotic Muslim Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it is offensive.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just offensive to the President.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s certainly offensive to a lot of Muslim Americans.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s just offensive to a lot of Americans who recognize that those kinds of cynical political tactics run directly contrary to the values that we hold dear in this country.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is looking forward to the opportunity to make that point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, we have seen a willingness on the part of leading Republican presidential candidates to try to appeal to people\xe2\x80\x99s fears and anxieties, and they capitalized on terrorist attacks to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that most Americans have had a particularly positive reaction about that.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is looking forward to the opportunity to affirm the kinds of values that are broadly held in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, a follow-up on that.\xc2\xa0 In Turkey when we were there, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t limit it to a partisan attack against Republicans.\xc2\xa0 He was very frustrated with Democrats on Capitol Hill and in this country that were questioning the Syrian refugee program.\xc2\xa0 Are tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s comments limited just to Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Is it essentially a partisan critique that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to make?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there are people in both parties who\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten swept up -- or at least at the time, sort of got swept up in the furor around all of this.\xc2\xa0 But I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to make the case that Democrats have -- well, let me just say it this way.\xc2\xa0 It has been a transparent strategy on the part of Republicans to play on people\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties, to target religious minorities to advance their political ambition.\xc2\xa0 And there have been some people who are not Republicans who have gotten a little swept up in that.\xc2\xa0 And the President was frustrated by that.\xc2\xa0 But there is no doubt that the cynical strategy that\'s been employed by some leading Republican candidates is a violation of our values that the President is most concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just on the Paul Ryan and the meeting with Leader McConnell, I understand you want to talk about the things that were on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and you want to leave the reaction from the Republicans to their folks.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the things that they brought to the meeting?\xc2\xa0 What did he say?\xc2\xa0 What were the topics of conversation that were beyond the five things that he wanted to talk about, and what did he say about them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t a question about what their comments were.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\'re being very clever, so I\'ll give you that up front.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to have a whole lot more detail than this.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t want to talk about the topics that -- the other topics that were discussed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because I want to be deferential to Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to describe their contribution to the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I also didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit in on the meeting, so the level of granular detail I can provide to you is limited.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I can say that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention in the first run at this is the President was pleased with the opportunity to sit down with them, and he was -- again, for all of the divisiveness and hateful rhetoric and pessimism and partisanship that we see on the campaign trail, it actually is possible for leading Republicans to sit down in the same office with a leading Democrat and have a conversation about the priorities of the country.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not treasonous to do that.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\'s part of the responsibility that goes along with leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they agreed on everything.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But where there are areas of agreement --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t want to give an example of where they didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 But where they did agree, there is an obligation that both sides have to try to find that common ground.\xc2\xa0 And the President, in the year that [he] remains in office, is certainly committed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 And maybe it\'s easier for Republicans to do that, knowing that the President is not on the ballot.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Ryan said he was reminded of that today.\xc2\xa0 If that makes it easier for us to get some business done in Congress that\'s going to benefit the American people, then maybe we should hold the Iowa caucus every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the list that you keep referencing for this meeting, you mentioned several times that trying to fight the heroin epidemic is something that seems to be an area of possible compromise.\xc2\xa0 But are there any signs that Congress is willing to allocate these new resources that the President is calling for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see what sort of Republican reaction there has been to the budget proposal that we put forward today. But I\'m confident that as the Congress undertakes the serious work that they have to undertake to pass a budget that the proposal that we put forward will be carefully considered.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, oftentimes budgetary debates sort of break down along party lines, and I would acknowledge that things like investing in education is something that Democrats have traditionally supported and Republicans have been traditionally skeptical of that.\xc2\xa0 And we can have a debate about that, but that is sort of a traditionally partisan thing.\xc2\xa0 I do think that most Americans agree with Democrats on that, but that\'s another matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMy point is, is there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing inherently partisan about dedicating the kinds of resources that we have proposed to helping people who are suffering from heroin addiction.\xc2\xa0 And both parties recognize that there are long-term consequences not just for those individuals and not just for their families, but for the broader community.\xc2\xa0 And trying to address the root causes of some of that is an area where we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful we can find some common ground.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back on Iowa.\xc2\xa0 It now seems official, the AP has just declared Clinton the winner of the caucuses.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of responsibility, Josh, that the AP has.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is an election that\xe2\x80\x99s conducted by the Iowa Democratic Party, but yet it is the Associated Press who determines whether or not who won.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did not do it personally from my phone.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I was going to say that\xe2\x80\x99s an impressive show of multitasking to sit there in the front row and count votes at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Listen, this is the first contest in what I expect will be a series of competitive ones.\xc2\xa0 And it was a spirited and close race in Iowa, and I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s not the last state where we say that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no kind of congratulatory message?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously, Secretary Clinton has won, so congratulations to her.\xc2\xa0 But, look -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they feel good about that.\xc2\xa0 They should.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- Secretary Clinton, based on her 2008 experience, knows better than anybody that these kinds of contests -- or that the path to the Democratic nomination is a long one.\xc2\xa0 And she can -- again, based on her 2008 experience, she would tell you that the outcome in Iowa is not indicative of the outcome in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 So whether or not she came out on top in Iowa, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that she would be campaigning like an underdog in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you make of how close it was?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it came down to three-tenths of a point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s a spirited debate.\xc2\xa0 And she clearly had a very sophisticated and effective turnout operation, and her field staff and her staff in Iowa I think should feel very good about the way their operation performed last night.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Senator Sanders has, just in the space of a few months, inspired a passionate following.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to his skills as a candidate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a testament to the power of his message.\xc2\xa0 And he should feel pretty good about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the one advantage I would say that he has is it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to take that message to other states, and Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team are going to have to do the hard work of building a grassroots infrastructure in the states ahead.\xc2\xa0 So, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a spirited competition.\xc2\xa0 I think all of that is good for the country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the democratic process.\xc2\xa0 I also think, as I mentioned to Josh, I do expect that it will eventually be good for the Democratic nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton got lots of attention from one of her emails where she called the caucus process \xe2\x80\x9ca creature of the extremes of both parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So would you say that the results last night exemplified that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult thing for me to comment on because, based on my own experience, I have a different sort of assessment of the caucus process.\xc2\xa0 There is no denying that because of the impediments to participating in the caucus, you don\xe2\x80\x99t just sort of show up in a 12-hour window and cast a secret ballot -- at least on the Democratic side.\xc2\xa0 It requires more of a sustained commitment to the process and to the party.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo does that mean that you\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to have partisans participating in the process?\xc2\xa0 It definitely does.\xc2\xa0 But, look, everybody knows the rules on the front end.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if it was -- that it was a surprise to anybody who is participating in the caucuses exactly what the rules were going to be.\xc2\xa0 And this is the kind of competition, again, that serves to hone the organizing skills of a particular campaign.\xc2\xa0 It certainly hones the skills of candidates who are put to the test of participating in town hall meetings and forums and living room conversations for months on end.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a grueling process.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s one that reflects something important about our democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are Iowans in both parties who are participating in essentially community-run, self-run events to organize, cast ballots, and have them counted.\xc2\xa0 So there are parts of it that are a little anachronistic, but it also is a pretty pure form of the kind of democratic ideals that are pretty important to the strength of our democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the extreme closeness of the Democratic race, and Ted Cruz coming out on top -- was that surprising to the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly surprised.\xc2\xa0 Traditionally, in Iowa -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what everybody at the White House thought, but traditionally, at least in recent history, those on the Republican side, those candidates that had demonstrated the most success in building support in the evangelical community in Iowa had ended up winning the Iowa caucuses.\xc2\xa0 That was true of Senator Santorum in 2012.\xc2\xa0 It was certainly true of Governor Huckabee in 2008.\xc2\xa0 And knowing how hard Senator Cruz had worked to build support in that community in Iowa, I know that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what the polls say, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly surprised by the outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you look at each side, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this kind of a perfect example, though, of the extremes of both parties in this particular contest?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I did have the chance to watch some of the C-SPAN coverage of a couple of the polling locations -- caucus locations yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And the process is not always clean and efficient, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think everybody that I saw on camera, at least, was an extremist.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can tell by looking?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It seemed to me that most people were committed to participating in a democratic process, both on the Republican and Democratic side.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some news coverage of that email from Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 My experience in the caucuses has just been different.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And do you know if the President watched any of the results coming in last night?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him this morning, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much he watched.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he has read a lot of the coverage of the results, though.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Speaker Ryan did put out -- his office put out a note this morning criticizing what the President wants to do with his budget.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not that that was unexpected, but what does that mean for some of these really specific elements that the President wants to fund for the upcoming year?\xc2\xa0 Even some of the ones where you say there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bipartisan support, but hearing that from Speaker Ryan, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly sound too optimistic overall.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, budgets are always -- particularly in an era of divided government -- are always an exercise in compromise.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been true the last couple of years.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that if we can reach a budget agreement this year, that the same will be true.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be some budget priorities that Speaker Ryan is able to advance in the context of the budget, and hopefully, there will be some priorities that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to advance, too. And if we strike that compromise in the right place, I think it would be a good thing for the country and I think it will attract the support that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to be passed by the Congress and signed into law by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Among those priorities, even when the President met with the Democratic leadership and afterwards you laid out what those priorities were, Gitmo was never mentioned, even though in other venues you talk about that being a major priority.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out that the plan is going to save money.\xc2\xa0 All of the virtues of this plan you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out.\xc2\xa0 But by never mentioning it as something that the President can work with Republicans on, are you essentially saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance of that going anywhere?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to do is to lay out the areas where a bipartisan agreement is likely -- in some cases, blatantly obvious -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, not many members of Congress share that priority.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not going to stop us from making the case that doing so would be good for our national security and would be good for our country\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isaac.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did the President lay out any desire for the TPP vote to happen before the lame duck session?\xc2\xa0 Was that part of the conversation at all?\xc2\xa0 You talked about the calendar and the immediate, but what\xe2\x80\x99s his take in the meeting, or what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s take?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there was a general discussion about timing for considering congressional votes on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not there yet because there are some additional steps that this agreement has to go through before it can be presented to Congress.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t laid out any firm deadlines at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve just made the case that it would be good for the country and our economy for the Trans-Pacific Partnership to be approved by Congress as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 The good news is, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the White House that shares that view.\xc2\xa0 Other organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and the Farm Bureau, who are strong supporters of Republican causes, who share that view.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, ideally, would you want this passed before the lame duck session, before the election, or vote to happen --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to have to work with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell on that.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t set out any firm timing deadlines at this point, but we certainly would have a bias toward earlier action from Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans would say that what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with this meeting and the stuff that you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out is that it\xe2\x80\x99s an old game from you guys, that you sort of beat them up for being obstructionists, and then use it for political gain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Prove us wrong.\xc2\xa0 Prove us wrong.\xc2\xa0 Do it.\xc2\xa0 Just do the five things then.\xc2\xa0 Take that argument off the table.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if the Republicans were to pass TPP and criminal justice reform, then you think that the Republican majority should be reelected?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, certainly not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I think Republicans would certainly have a stronger case to make to the American electorate that they should be able to retain the majority if they can actually point to something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the last year other than vote to repeal Obamacare.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ll probably queue up four or five more of those votes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not doing anybody any good.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not helping any Republicans do anything.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not helping anybody find a job.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not strengthening our economy.\xc2\xa0 It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t strengthening the security of the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not helping anybody get access to health care.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not improving our fiscal situation.\xc2\xa0 So what are Republicans doing to address those challenges?\xc2\xa0 The President has got some good ideas of where we can work with Republicans to do that, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually seen anything from Republicans about that.\xc2\xa0 If anything, we see comments from people like Tom Cotton who suggest that even bipartisan agreements should be torpedoed somehow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys think that the Republicans should be voted out of office, whatever they do on these agenda items, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately, what we believe is that Republicans should work with the President on at least these five areas because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country for them to do so and because they say that they support these things.\xc2\xa0 So if you accept that being elected to Congress means that you have some sort of responsibility to try to take the country a better, stronger, healthier, more prosperous place, then this should be a good place to start.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can have vigorous debates about a bunch of other things that Republicans should do.\xc2\xa0 We believe they should vote to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 But we can at least start, as a practical matter, by focusing on areas where we know there is agreement, and where there is bipartisan agreement that this kind of progress would be good for the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that Republicans need any sort of electoral advice from me -- Republicans in Congress have done just fine in elections by ignoring me.\xc2\xa0 But my point is that in November, incumbents are going to be on the campaign trail making the case to their constituents about why they should be reelected.\xc2\xa0 Why not go on the campaign trail and say that you should be reelected because you are helping communities across the country fight heroin addiction; because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership and cut taxes on 18,000 American goods that are imposed by other countries; or that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a historic investment in curing cancer?\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of things that -- again, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a Democrat or a Republican, those are the kinds of credentials that are going to enhance anybody\xe2\x80\x99s prospects for reelection.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you had previously listed seven things where there might be common ground -- AUMF and EITC.\xc2\xa0 Did the President take those off the list today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those continue to be strong priorities that we support.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Saving those for lunch?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll save those for a follow-up meeting maybe.\xc2\xa0 Those continue to be items on our agenda.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the deal with the AUMF is that this is something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually talked about in a number of other meetings.\xc2\xa0 And there have been -- it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that there have been some staff-level discussions about this as well.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, it also might be a little harder to find some bipartisan common ground on this one.\xc2\xa0 So they didn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time on that in the meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The EITC thing -- our view on the EITC proposal is pretty well known.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise to either leader that this is something that the President advocates.\xc2\xa0 It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the agenda today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, on Selective Service.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration against expanding it to women, or you\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to wait and see until the Pentagon --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest, I was informed of this congressional exchange shortly before I walked out here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any rigorous policy process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway to consider changing that policy.\xc2\xa0 But let me take a look and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information on this I can provide to you.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you that right now, our policy on this has not changed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Toluse.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Puerto Rico first.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the ordering of the list, of the agenda is an indication of how important and how much the President pushes those things.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not in any order.\xc2\xa0 The reason I noted Puerto Rico first is just to underscore the commitment that the House had made and Speaker Ryan had made to take action on giving the leaders of Puerto Rico greater restructuring authority early in this calendar year.\xc2\xa0 And so I guess in some ways it\xe2\x80\x99s in chronological order in which we hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll take action, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a reflection of our priorities. All of these things are important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did you get any sense from Leader McConnell that he also would move on this quickly?\xc2\xa0 Because it does seem like there\xe2\x80\x99s a timeline with Puerto Rico sort of having the clock ticking on them in terms of their finances.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the situation in Puerto Rico is certainly urgent, and obviously Secretary Lew has spent quite a bit of time working on this, even traveling down to Puerto Rico just a couple weeks ago to have additional conversations on this. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Leader McConnell about any commitments he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to make about timing for Senate consideration of that kind of legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Speaker Ryan, on a number of different occasions -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it came up at the meeting -- has said that one of the top things he wants from the President is for the President to lay out a plan for how to defeat ISIS.\xc2\xa0 I know you guys have talked about this regularly, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like he\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied with whatever plan that you all have put out.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t proposed an alternative, and he actually hasn\xe2\x80\x99t demonstrated yet a willingness to actually have members of Congress do the one thing that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do, which is vote to authorize the use of military force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly compelled by his rhetoric on this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Defense Secretary today laid out some information about how much more money they want to spend on the budget request for this upcoming year on counterterrorism and on defeating ISIS.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk about specifically what you hope to achieve with the extra money.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That will be part of the budget rollout that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do next week, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on that.\xc2\xa0 But the one component of the Defense budget that the Defense Department talked about in a little bit more detail was the European Reassurance Initiative funding that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking in this budget. And this would be money that would be used to strengthen and deepen our coordination with our NATO allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have asked our NATO allies to ramp up the kind of financial commitment that they make to their national security and to our collective defense as NATO allies.\xc2\xa0 And one way I think we can signal that being a priority is to ramp up our own commitment to those efforts.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what this budget proposal would do.\xc2\xa0 But Secretary Carter I think talked about that in a little bit more detail today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it relates to ISIL, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that next week.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 A suicide bomber in a suicide bomb attack this morning or yesterday killed about 20 different policemen and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about increasingly growing numbers of casualties among the Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s plan says that we would draw down U.S. troops from 9,800 to about 5,500 by the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 But it does seem like the Afghan security forces are really struggling and taking on more casualties, so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House is reconsidering that timeline, and whether or not you may end up having to change that timeline once again.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Toluse, let me start by just condemning in no uncertain terms this act of violence that occurred in Afghanistan yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It did target police officers -- or it appeared to target police officers who are just trying to keep the peace in their city and in their country.\xc2\xa0 And obviously our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were killed in this attack.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More generally, I think this is just the latest illustration of how Afghanistan continues to be a dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 And the security challenges in that country are significant, particularly when you consider an attack like this on police officers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What the administration, what the United States and our NATO allies have committed to do is to standing with the Afghan people and the Afghan national security forces as they take full responsibility for the security situation in their own country.\xc2\xa0 That was a responsibility that they assumed a little over a year ago, and it has proved to be a challenging task.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan is a big country, and there are extremists with a lot of skill that have sought to take the fight to those security forces.\xc2\xa0 But what we have seen is a willingness on the part of those security forces, even when sustaining losses, to fight for their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I cited the example of Kunduz last week, I believe, where you saw extremists overrun Afghan national security forces that were protecting the city of Kunduz and Afghan forces were forced to flee the city.\xc2\xa0 But what they did was they reorganized and acted quickly, with the support of the United States and our NATO allies, to within a couple of weeks, retake the city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is an indication of a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that additional training and equipping of Afghan national security forces is needed.\xc2\xa0 And that is the first pillar of the ongoing mission of U.S. troops and NATO troops that are still in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But the second thing it illustrates is that it illustrates the commitment that the Afghan national security forces have to fighting for their country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, and that bodes well for their long-term ability to fight extremists and eventually secure their country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you think that the timeline for now is the same.\xc2\xa0 No plans to change that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any policy changes to announce.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 To the best of your knowledge, has the President ever had a 50-point lead in a poll in a race?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Off the top of my head, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he ever lost a 50-point lead in a race, to the best of your knowledge?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he ever, in your memory, been involved in a race where he led the group by 50 points plus, and then finally on Election Day -- in this case, caucus day -- squeaks by, by less than 1 percent?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, now that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this, I do think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s 50 points, but I know that there was some pretty pessimistic polling the first time the President decided to run for the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 He was mired at the bottom in the very low single digits in that race, and he did, eventually, prevail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he faced some long odds the first time that he ran for President in 2007 and 2008.\xc2\xa0 But even at that time, we had encouraged people to not focus on the national polls but actually to consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s prospects in the early states because that was going to be part and parcel of our strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in national public service for more than two decades when this happened.\xc2\xa0 And so doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it speak to the weakness of the Clinton campaign to have barely squeaked by against a socialist in the caucuses?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I think what is clear is that there is a robust and vigorous campaign in store for Democrats in this presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for our democracy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good for a country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately going to be good for the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 The skills of the Democratic nominees are going to be honed and improved in the context of a vigorous debate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to see Democratic campaigns go from state to state, building up operations and exciting and inspiring and energizing their supporters.\xc2\xa0 And as we saw in 2008, that is going to have benefits for Democrats in the general election in 2016.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long this Democratic nomination process is going to take, but I think everybody has always expected that it would go beyond the early states.\xc2\xa0 How far beyond I think is the key question.\xc2\xa0 But if it goes far beyond those early states, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a bad thing for Democrats -- in fact, it was a really good thing for Democrats in 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, broadly, maybe for Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the Clinton camp today, are you doing a dance, or are you worried, looking over your shoulder, that objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Secretary Clinton herself said last night that she was breathing a sigh of relief.\xc2\xa0 So that generally means that they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling pretty good.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the other thing that they remember well is that New Hampshire primary from 2008, where even after sustaining a pretty significant defeat in Iowa in 2008 --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third-place finish.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- a third-place finish, that Secretary Clinton emerged victorious in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not following the race close enough to know whether or not something like that is possible this time around, but I think it is an indication that both candidates are going to be campaigning hard in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, there\xe2\x80\x99s some risk associated with that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple more.\xc2\xa0 On women in the military, you would agree and acknowledge that they serve honorably and well.\xc2\xa0 You would agree that they are entitled to every opportunity that any other servicemember should be entitled to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And you know the Secretary of Defense has recently announced a policy decision that would open up combat positions to women inside the military, too.\xc2\xa0 So this certainly is a principle that is on display not just in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric but in terms of some of the policies that we\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented that we believe will enhance and strengthen our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why not equal treatment in Selective Service?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is a policy decision that\xe2\x80\x99s being carefully --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Broadly speaking, is it a good idea, do you think?\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President might back something like that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll acknowledge I don\xe2\x80\x99t know sort of the pros and cons of advancing a policy like this, but we can look into it for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Lastly, on the economy and the deficit.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that -- or Mark mentioned the debt earlier.\xc2\xa0 An enormous number.\xc2\xa0 And then you came back and talked about the deficit and how you cut it down I think 75 percent is the number that you used.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet, you\xe2\x80\x99ve also acknowledged, or at least the CBO is suggesting that the deficit will, in fact, increase in 2016.\xc2\xa0 Do you acknowledge that is what will likely happen?\xc2\xa0 And if that is the case, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic plan still working?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go through a couple of these things.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wary of conceding that the early projections on the deficit are going to be right because they\xe2\x80\x99re usually wrong.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.\xc2\xa0 The second thing is we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some updated data that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to produce in the context of our budget rollout next Tuesday, a week from today. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to discuss some of the projections that we see as most likely in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third thing is the reason that the CBO made the change in their deficit projection was principally driven by the agreement to cut so many taxes at the end of last year and to make permanent some of those business tax cuts, not all of which we supported, but is part and parcel of a compromise budget agreement.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly do think that it merits asking Republicans -- who do believe with such conviction that the size of the debt and the deficit is a problem -- why they believe it is appropriate to pass and make permanent business tax cuts without paying for them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last one then.\xc2\xa0 On the meetings today -- and I know we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably get a bit of a readout from the Leader hopefully and from the Speaker as well -- did the President go into this meeting expecting something substantive to come out of it other than an exchange of ideas?\xc2\xa0 Or should we all expect that sometime in the next week or so, even shorter time period, that something concrete will be announced?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect -- our expectation going into this meeting was not that any specific policy announcements would be made coming out of it.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that the hope is that by having conversations among these three leaders in government, that it can lay the groundwork for effective progress on shared priorities in the future and hopefully a discussion about, for example, investing in a cure for cancer among the Speaker of the House, the Leader of the Senate, and the President of the United States -- that they can lay the groundwork for effective bipartisan discussions moving forward to try to find a budget compromise around those kinds of investments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, no, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect any sort of immediate announcement, but we are hopeful that it can lay the groundwork for some progress in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 George.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two follows on the Baltimore visit.\xc2\xa0 You put it in the context of the ongoing political campaign.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the scheduling of it for now, after seven years of requests by the community, is driven by the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to partake in that debate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think as Mike pointed out, the President was a pretty robust participant in that debate over the fall.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly think this is an opportunity in the eyes of the President to send a clear signal to the Muslim American community that the President of the United States is going to firmly defend your right in this country to worship God consistent with your tradition and your heritage.\xc2\xa0 That is a founding principle of our democracy.\xc2\xa0 It is part of what makes America the greatest country in the world.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that some people might perceive our commitment to those values cheapened by cynical political tactics from some Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to stand for that, and I think his appearance at the mosque tomorrow will make clear his commitment to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding principles.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not just sending a message to Muslim Americans.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s sending a message to other Americans, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that other Americans will make note of his visit and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if that arouses some controversy.\xc2\xa0 But, look, this is a debate that the President welcomes.\xc2\xa0 And so tune in tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 It will be interesting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect him to specifically mention the Republican debate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect any of the candidates tomorrow to enjoy the benefit of being singled out by the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President will\xc2\xa0 -- look, I think the fact that this visit is taking place in the current political context is obvious to everyone.\xc2\xa0 So even a subtle reference will be immediately recognizable to all of you that are such close observers of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speeches.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dave.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The European Reassurance Fund that you mentioned a little while ago -- first of all, did the President bring that up today in the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was something that came up.\xc2\xa0 It certainly was not the focus of a lot of discussion in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell.\xc2\xa0 I would hazard a guess that this would be the kind of investment that those two gentlemen would support.\xc2\xa0 But you should check with them to confirm that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you\'ve been pretty up front over the last several months about the fact that sanctions against Russia have not been changing Putin\xe2\x80\x99s mind about Ukraine and so on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Certainly not to the degree that we would like to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this proposal to quadruple the funding in this program to reassure NATO allies, is that another indication that diplomacy is not working with Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read it that way.\xc2\xa0 I think it is an indication that the United States values deeply the strength of our alliance in NATO, and we are investing in that alliance in a way that will have important national security benefits not just for the United States for also for our allies in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\'re doing that in part to send a clear signal to our NATO allies that we\'re committed to their defense, but also as a signal that they should be making a similarly serious commitment to enhancing their national security and investing in their national security capacity -- both because it will enhance the national security of that country, but also of our alliance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no better way to do that and to send the clear signal that we believe that those kinds of investments should be a priority than to go ahead and make that kind of investment ourselves.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the signal that we\'re hoping to send.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the White House expect that Putin\xe2\x80\x99s response will be?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what his response will be.\xc2\xa0 I think he prides himself on being a little unpredictable.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure if he will determine that such an announcement merits a response.\xc2\xa0 But if he does, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will make sure that we\'re all aware of it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in the back.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hi, there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple quick questions.\xc2\xa0 One, I just want to go through the TPP tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s being signed in New Zealand tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet it still has to go through its process here, which, of course, is not fully understood in New Zealand and the countries outside of America.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of people in America that don\'t entirely understand that process.\xc2\xa0 You might even include me in that category.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Worst-case scenario, Congress doesn\'t pass it.\xc2\xa0 The public throws their arms up in the air.\xc2\xa0 What then happens to that agreement that they\xe2\x80\x99ve signed in New Zealand?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I don\'t expect that that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 There is strong bipartisan support in the United States Congress for a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that achieves the goals that we achieved in the context of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re bullish about the prospects for completing this agreement and we\'re certainly going to make the case to Congress that they should act as quickly as possible on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the good news is, is it\xe2\x80\x99s not just going to the Democratic President trying to appeal to Republicans in Congress to support this agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to be relying on the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau, National Association of Manufacturers and other Republican-friendly organizations to make a strong case to the Republicans that they work closely with to support this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong case, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making it pretty aggressively.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll also note that because of the successful passage of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation last year, we see a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is there is a clear sort of outline for a strategy for getting this passed.\xc2\xa0 The Trade Promotion Authority legislation was designed around this idea of getting Republicans to vote for authority that the Democratic President could use to negotiate the agreement.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a pretty tough sell among Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Our sell this time is much clearer.\xc2\xa0 Right now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got 18,000 American goods that are facing taxes that are imposed by other countries and we believe we should cut those taxes.\xc2\xa0 Republicans like cutting taxes.\xc2\xa0 They surely like cutting taxes that other countries unfairly put on American products.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a stronger case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing is that because of Trade Promotion Authority, at least in the United States Senate, we don\'t have to worry about the 60-vote filibuster threshold.\xc2\xa0 And that should also make it at least lower the bar for congressional passage of this approval legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, so Asia and Australia and New Zealand can be confident that this is actually going to go through at some point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it done.\xc2\xa0 And so hopefully they will be, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very -- you had one more?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question on the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been discovered that this is possibly as a result of 500,000 mosquitoes being genetically engineered mosquitoes being released in the Amazon as a result of actually American testing and experimentation by companies, such as Bill Gates\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 Would there ever be any accountability in that situation?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think there should be any accountability to organizations who are releasing genetically modified insects without in this case failing to observe or acknowledge what could happen without antibiotics?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have to admit I have not seen the news report that you\'re citing.\xc2\xa0 I think what I can say about this is it is clear there is a lot more that needs to be learned about the science behind this disease.\xc2\xa0 There are still questions that are being raised about the precise linkage between the Zika virus and this particular birth defect.\xc2\xa0 There are questions that are raised about how closely those two things are actually related.\xc2\xa0 And that will have consequences for what steps we can take to try to fight this disease.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that needs to be learned.\xc2\xa0 In fact, this is why the CDC and others have devoted so many resources to trying to study this disease, to try to interview those individuals that have suffered sort of the worst impacts that we\'re quite -- most concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And so the more that we learn will inform our ability both to protect the American people here at home, but also to make sure that something like this, if we can prevent it -- keep it from happening again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The report that actually came out that (inaudible) in Brazil, I think -- they did a study that they released in 2015, and it was directly related to genetically engineered mosquitos.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke to President Rousseff earlier this week, where they talked about -- or maybe it was last week -- where they talked about how we could coordinate our efforts to fight this disease.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to stay in touch with them moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:07 P.M.
