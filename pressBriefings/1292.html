BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us on this flight to Fort Bliss.\xc2\xa0 Just for starters, the President did speak with President Bush this morning.\xc2\xa0 We won\xe2\x80\x99t be reading that call out, but they did speak on Air Force One.</p>\n<p>And with that, Ben, if you want to talk a little bit about today\xe2\x80\x99s speech, his.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President wanted to take this opportunity to thank our troops for their service.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting Fort Bliss, which is a base that has had troops who served at every stage of the Iraq war -- the initial invasion, through many of the challenges that ensued in the years that followed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Sorry, you want me to take some of these?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So Fort Bliss is a base that has had troops who served at every stage of the Iraq war -- the initial invasion, the many challenges that followed.\xc2\xa0 There are troops who are rotating back home right now, and there are troops that will be a part of the support mission going forward in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So President Obama is looking forward to thanking the troops for their service.</p>\n<p>Later tonight, of course, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking to the nation from the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to do several things.\xc2\xa0 This of course is an important milestone for our country as we mark the end of the combat mission in Iraq, and the President wants to take this opportunity to again underscore his gratitude to all those Americans who have rendered such extraordinary service in Iraq, as well as to their families.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll want to describe what\xe2\x80\x99s taken place since he last spoke about the Iraq war in detail in February of 2009, which includes, of course, our drawdown of nearly 100,000 troops and a transition to Iraqi responsibility for security within Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also want to talk about the enduring partnership that we are building with Iraq and with the Iraqi people, particularly as we shift into a civilian lead for our presence in Iraq.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing Iraq in his speech tonight, of course, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll also be addressing the broader context of this drawdown.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the President is drawing down in Iraq and ending our combat because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s best interest for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future.\xc2\xa0 He also believes that we need to refocus resources both on the national security front and on the domestic front.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since taken office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve refocused a great deal of resources on the fight against al Qaeda worldwide to include our efforts within Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And similarly, he feels it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to refocus resources that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been spending abroad over the last several years into investing in our economy and our long-term competitiveness here at home.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing that as a part of the context for the end of the combat mission in Iraq.</p>\n<p>And with that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Bill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take some questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the call to President Bush?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It was a private conversation so we\xe2\x80\x99re just -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have any readout.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I said that right at the top.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time was it and how long was it?\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just say it earlier on the trip and it was just for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to address the Iraqi leadership and the need for the government to coalesce around a transition, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a timetable involving that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Iraq of course had a democratic election in the spring.\xc2\xa0 We are not surprised by the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s been an extended process of government formation.\xc2\xa0 The election was very close.\xc2\xa0 Last time it took six months to form a government and this election had no single party that won a majority.</p>\n<p>However, we are going -- we are urging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency in forming a government.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that government should be inclusive and should represent the results of the democratic election that was held, and we believe that the Iraqis are making progress towards that goal.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that Vice President Biden is also discussing in his meetings with Iraqi leaders on the ground yesterday and today as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any timetable?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to put a timetable on government formation.\xc2\xa0 Again, we expected this extended process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in line with what happened in the past and with the closeness of the election results.\xc2\xa0 What we are saying, though, is that Iraq should move forward with a sense of urgency around government formation, that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get down to some of these core issues.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Iraqi leaders have been doing in recent days, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Vice President Biden is discussing in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you argue that Iraq is really ready to stand up when there is no government and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern that the security forces aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to fully take on responsibility?\xc2\xa0 Even the army\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff said it could take another 10 years.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to separate two questions here.\xc2\xa0 On the security side, over the course of this drawdown in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve removed nearly 100,000 troops from Iraq, what General Odierno has done on the ground is gradually transition to Iraqis being in the lead for security.</p>\n<p>So, for instance, last year, American troops pulled out of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s cities, and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces have had full responsibility for the security of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s cities for some time now.\xc2\xa0 They provided full security for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s elections.\xc2\xa0 So really what\xe2\x80\x99s taken place is they\xe2\x80\x99ve been moving into the lead over the course of this drawdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s no dramatic shift from August 31st to September 1st in that respect because they\xe2\x80\x99ve already been moving into the lead.</p>\n<p>And what\xe2\x80\x99ve been pleased with is that Iraqi security forces have held the gains of the last year or two years in terms of security within Iraq, that the trend lines remain low in terms of the incidences of violence.\xc2\xa0 And so we do have great confidence in the ability of the Iraqi security forces to maintain security.</p>\n<p>Similarly, even in the process of government formation, they have retained their loyalty to the Iraqi constitution and to the Iraqi institutions of government under the transitional government that\xe2\x80\x99s in place.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re completely confident that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces have capability to move into the lead as they have done.</p>\n<p>As it relates to our continued support to them, the reason that we are maintaining a transitional force in Iraq in the coming months that currently numbers at 50,000 is because we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to advise and assist the Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to provide them with support as they are in the lead in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So they will continue to have a very strong support from the United States on the security side in the months to come.</p>\n<p>On the political side, again, we believe that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders should move forward with urgency to form a government.\xc2\xa0 There is, however, a caretaker government in place that is running Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s ministries, running Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s government.\xc2\xa0 And again, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces have operated very effectively and competently under that caretaker administration, so we believe that they are fully prepared and will be in the lead.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident in their ability to do so going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How big a risk is another spike in violence, especially with the government not yet being formed?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think -- you see a couple things in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 You see the overall trend lines in a good place in the sense that over the last several months, over the whole course of the year, indeed, the level of security incidences and all the different kind of metrics that we look at, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s acts of violence, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s casualties among Iraqi civilians and security forces, those trend lines remain in a good place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also know, however, that there continue to be groups such as al Qaeda in Iraq most prominently that will carry out attacks and who will try to make those attacks gain as much attention as possible.\xc2\xa0 So we have no illusions that violence is over in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There continue to be acts of violence, and there will continue to be in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>What those acts of violence have not done, though, is fundamentally alter the security situation.\xc2\xa0 They have not sparked a sectarian war.\xc2\xa0 They have not led to a loss of confidence among the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>So even as this violence will continue, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the trend lines are in the right direction, that there have been serious blows struck against al Qaeda in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, just in recent months.\xc2\xa0 Their top two leaders were taken off the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 Our estimates are that 32 of their 42 leadership have been removed.\xc2\xa0 So we believe we\xe2\x80\x99re still in the process of steadily degrading al Qaeda in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, a lot of those leadership captures and kills that have taken place in recent months were carried out by Iraqi-led operations.\xc2\xa0 So the Iraqi security forces are the ones who are carrying out those kinds of operations with our intelligence support and otherwise.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re confident in the ability to maintain these security gains with the Iraqi security forces in the lead, even as we know that there will continue to be challenges.</p>\n<p>Now, in this particular timeframe of Ramadan, there are often increases in attacks during Ramadan; that has been the case over the years in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And we also know some may try to draw attention to themselves by exploiting a period of government formation and transition in Iraq.</p>\n<p>But again, what they have not done -- what they have failed to do, and we believe they will fail to do, is fundamentally alter the security situation in Iraq and fundamentally spark a sectarian war which the Iraqis have rejected in recent years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long is his speech?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say it will be like 15 minutes, roughly the same as the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much time will be devoted to the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, this is principally a speech about what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99ll address it in the context I discussed, which is that part of the context of ending the war in Iraq is drawing down the resources we are spending in fighting wars overseas so that we can focus on our economy at home.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll touch on the economy, but again, this is a speech that\xe2\x80\x99s about the end of the combat mission in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, is he going to talk about what if Iraq requests a continued military presence beyond 2011?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He will not discuss that specifically because the fact of the matter is, there are two things -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to separate them.\xc2\xa0 There is the timeline that the President set in February of 2009 to remove our combat brigades and end our combat mission.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s led to the drawdown of nearly 100,000 troops from Iraq and the shift to a support mission starting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Second -- but the second point is, there is a security agreement that exists between the United States and the Iraqi government, an agreement that was reached under the previous administration, which calls for all of U.S. troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011.\xc2\xa0 We would only -- again, the Iraqi government has not requested an amendment to that agreement, so that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They could ask for that any time between now and 2011.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 They could ask for it, absolutely, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- we have to receive their request before we\xe2\x80\x99re able to discuss it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Ben -- sorry -- is the President going to be making any other calls to any other allies or world leaders today?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Actually, since you mention it, General Jones is calling a number of his counterparts from coalition partners who have been with us throughout the Iraq war.\xc2\xa0 Obviously many of those coalition partners have ended their own commitments in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 However, given the fact that this is such a milestone in the history of the Iraq war, and given the sacrifices that so many nations made alongside us in Iraq, we will be making calls at the level of General Jones and other senior officials to counterparts in the UK and Europe, in Australia.\xc2\xa0 We can get you a full list.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re handling those kinds of calls.\xc2\xa0 But we feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p>\n<p>Again, part of what today is, is just a milestone in what\xe2\x80\x99s been a very difficult war over the last seven and a half years.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate, we think, to use that milestone to recognize that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Americans and Iraqis who sacrificed in Iraq; that there are coalition partners with us who did so as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President talk or reference his own initial opposition to the -- and continuous opposition to the invasion of Iraq?\xc2\xa0 And will he draw parallels between what the administration is billing as a success of this mission as he tries to kind of make the argument that America can prevail in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 I think his position on the war is well known.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s well known, of course, that he opposed going to war in Iraq, so I think that he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be talking about the fact that the war has been an issue of debate and disagreement at times over the years.\xc2\xa0 But today is a day that we can all agree on our appreciation for the service our troops have rendered, and our hopes for a better future for Iraq.</p>\n<p>I think with regard to Afghanistan, there we face a tough fight, a different fight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s similar in the sense that we have increased our forces for a period of time to provide space -- to provide additional training for Afghan security forces and space for Afghan leaders to build their capacity, and it\xe2\x80\x99s similar in the sense that as in Iraq, Afghans will of course have to move into the lead over time as well.</p>\n<p>But again, they\xe2\x80\x99re also different conflicts with different histories to them -- and different countries, of course.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he restate the language on the start of the withdrawal next year?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of debate about that.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people have had a sort of a -- generals, politicians, whatever, had a say about it.\xc2\xa0 Will he restate that language tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far ahead of it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that he will -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing what is our clear policy in Afghanistan that includes that transition.\xc2\xa0 And our policy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed in that respect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he address the removal of Saddam?\xc2\xa0 And for that matter, does the President believe that Iraq is better off now that Saddam is no longer in power, given that, as Robert said yesterday, if he were in office, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone to war?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, certainly he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing what has taken place in the history of the Iraq war, which of course involves removing Saddam Hussein from power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think as it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s views, he opposed the war in Iraq in 2002 because he felt that it was a distraction from al Qaeda and from some of our challenges at home.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Iraq today, what he thinks has been forged in Iraq is an opportunity for the Iraqi people to have a better future.\xc2\xa0 Because of the extraordinary services of our troops who persevered through many years, as well as our civilians, together with very huge sacrifices from the Iraqi people, the Iraqis have an opportunity here that they can seize to build their own country, to forge a future that is inclusive of all of the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that is an opportunity the President, again, will urge the Iraqi people to seize, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll underscore that the United States will be a partner to the Iraqi people in that effort.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Got anything else?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got a question for you.\xc2\xa0 The New York Post reporting this morning Elizabeth Warren is apparently expected to be named.\xc2\xa0 Can you address that at all, or -- many of the bankers assume that she will be named.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No update on the timing for that position.\xc2\xa0 But like Robert said yesterday, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate something before the end of this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Would not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would not.\xc2\xa0 And also, is there any possibility of a recess appointment for that position?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I have no update on the appointment for that position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this situation in the Netherlands, these arrests that have been made, has the President been getting briefed on this?\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any update on the investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is an instance where I think that everyone in government was impressed with the amount of information sharing that happened with some of our partners overseas and the speed with which we were able to run incidents to the ground, even transcontinentally.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still gathering facts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when we have more information.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, the President has been briefed on this incident, just like he\xe2\x80\x99s briefed on other intelligence incidents over the normal course of his day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been concluded whether or not they were actually trying to plot any type of attack?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of any conclusions further than what I said, which is just that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the information-gathering stage at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it being investigated as a potential attack?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question more for the authorities.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re looking into all the information that\xe2\x80\x99s available.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about the economy.\xc2\xa0 This is a big foreign policy week for the President.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern in the White House that maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a perception that he\xe2\x80\x99s neglecting the economy, first day back after vacation?\xc2\xa0 He gave some remarks about it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the background the next couple of days and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some bad data.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are criticizing him as being out of touch, and I just want to know if you could respond to that.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 For starters, from their track record it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear the Republicans will criticize no matter what is happening and they\xe2\x80\x99ll try to obstruct no matter what the President tries to do.\xc2\xa0 But the President is less worried about the perception of whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s doing anything and more concerned about the pace at which we need to get the economy moving.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make some progress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen private job growth, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the economy continue to grow, but not at a rate that\xe2\x80\x99s fast enough for the President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he thinks that as soon as the Senate gets back, they need to move forward on the small business legislation that will cut capital gains taxes for small businesses, allowing them to hire; it will help free up credit; it will help the engine of our economy do what we need to do in this economy, which is to create jobs.</p>\n<p>So the President thinks that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that needs to be done and he\xe2\x80\x99s working very hard every single day to move the ball forward on the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on tomorrow, what the President hopes to accomplish in the initial talks, Mideast peace?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You want to talk a little about that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President will be holding a series of bilateral meetings tomorrow with each of the leaders.\xc2\xa0 Those will be one-on-one meetings between him and President Mubarak, King Abdullah, Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.\xc2\xa0 And then he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hosting a dinner with all the leaders tomorrow at the White House.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s setting the stage for the direct negotiations that will begin at the State Department the following day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think what the President wants to do is be able to speak to each of these key individuals in these talks to discuss what can be achieved, to discuss the importance of moving forward and the importance of comprehensive peace in the Middle East to all of our interests, and to build trust among the different leaders through his interactions and through the dinner that they\xe2\x80\x99ll share tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to set the stage heading into the resumption of direct talks, and to express his personal support for this effort that will be led by Secretary Clinton the following day.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:00 P.M.
