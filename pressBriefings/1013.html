Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:07 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I will engage in what I trust will be a brief briefing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements.\xc2\xa0 I think we put out the trip next week, correct?\xc2\xa0 To Fort Bragg.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to that visit, even more than he looks forward to spending a lot of time with you as we get closer and closer to Christmas.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Share the wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Share the wealth.\xc2\xa0 Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, please.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Putin today was accusing the U.S. of interference in Russian affairs.\xc2\xa0 I wondered what your response was to that, and where concerns about the problems with the elections leave the reset of U.S.-Russian relations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Clinton spoke to this issue in Brussels today.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Russia have many common interests, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me discuss, and this administration has sought to develop and nurture those interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough engagement with the Russian government, we have advanced several of our top security and economic interests.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, based on mutual respect and those common interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, we have sought to deepen our engagement with Russian society and to promote universal values.\xc2\xa0 When rights are violated in Russia, or in any other country, we speak out.\xc2\xa0 We are going to continue to pursue both tracks of engagement in the promotion of our interests and our values.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll go on to say that we are encouraged by President Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to have the Central Election Commission investigate all election violations, and we welcome his acknowledgment that the demonstrations in Moscow and other cities are part of the democratic process.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What specifically would the administration be willing to compromise on, as it relates to the appointment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President indicated any efforts to compromise.\xc2\xa0 I think he made a very compelling case for why a law that was debated, negotiated, and passed successfully through Congress and was signed into law by the this President should be implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I think he said in response to Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question, if there are members of Congress in the Senate or the House who have a problem with the bill or with the law as it is, and want to change it, submit a bill.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t block it through parliamentary tactics, the implementation of the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 Because who loses?\xc2\xa0 Not the non-financial -- or rather non-bank financial institutions, the oversight of which is being held up because of the Senate Republican filibuster.\xc2\xa0 The people who lose are the American consumers who engage with those non-bank financial institutions all the time -- payday lenders, and mortgage service providers, student loan companies -- veterans.\xc2\xa0 So they ought to do the right thing for American consumers.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it for the President.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not na\xc3\xafve enough to believe that, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a payroll tax cut or a confirmation, they would do it for that reason.\xc2\xa0 But they ought to do it because their constituents are demanding it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Plan B, the critics in your -- there are some critics in your own party who say that science lost to politics.\xc2\xa0 Did this have anything to do with politics?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the decision was Secretary Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you heard, supports that decision, and I think he gave pretty compelling reasons for why he supports the decision, both as President and as a father.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then to the question of politics with regards to this or anything else, I covered politics for a long time, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what the right -- there are politics in every issue, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an upside and a downside to every issue.\xc2\xa0 And usually, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know in advance how these things will play out politically, which is just another reason why decisions like these ought to be made on the merits, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secretary Sebelius did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he framed it in terms of 11- and 13-year-old girls.\xc2\xa0 The cutoff is not 13, it\xe2\x80\x99s 17.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The current cutoff is, right.\xc2\xa0 But the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in terms of 16-year-old, 15-year-old girls, who studies show many of whom are sexually active and would actually have more use for the morning-after pill -- he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it in those terms.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But the decision that the Secretary made was to say yes to or say no to the allowing of any girl of any age -- or younger girls included -- I mean, not just 16-year-olds, but it was a -- it would have resulted in allowing, as the President said, somebody to buy it along with batteries and bubble gum.\xc2\xa0 So -- a 9-, 10-, 11-year-old.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was the decision that Secretary Sebelius faced.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction to the stiff sentence handed down to former governor Blagojevich?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him discuss that, so -- I know you -- he didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to your question, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has a reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask why you think -- I mean, the President comes in and makes what he believes is a compelling case that Republicans are blocking this person who would really help middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You believe it, too, Ed, come on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course I believe it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In all seriousness, how -- why is it not breaking through, then -- let\xe2\x80\x99s forget about the Republican leadership, people like Senator McConnell, who have been opposed to the President on a lot of things -- Susan Collins, you\xe2\x80\x99re targeting her, in a way, by reaching out to the media in Maine; you\xe2\x80\x99ve made this big PR blitz all week where you\xe2\x80\x99ve billed as, like, we\xe2\x80\x99re really going to pressure people on the fence on this.\xc2\xa0 And people like Susan Collins have heard the President\xe2\x80\x99s case and they just say, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you make a good point, that this club of Republicans in the Congress are sometimes at odds not just with the President but with a overwhelming majority of public opinion for things that this President also happens to support.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that if there were a referendum or plebiscite in Maine, I feel pretty confident that Democrats, independents and Republicans would support the confirmation of a consumer watchdog whose job it is to look out, in Washington, for their interests in their dealings with financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, there\xe2\x80\x99s this amnesia about what happened just a few years ago, and how it happened, and who got left holding the bag.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion that maybe you or your colleagues should have with Senator Collins or the other senators who unfortunately did not do the right thing today.\xc2\xa0 But we hope, given the opportunity, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do the right thing on another day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it say something about his use of the bully pulpit that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying this and it\xe2\x80\x99s not working with people in the middle?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We live in a challenging political environment, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 But in the end, everyone here -- the President, Vice President and every member of Congress -- answers to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 And on every measure of the American Jobs Act, including the payroll tax cut extension and expansion, there is overwhelming public support -- Democratic, independent, Republican support.\xc2\xa0 And referring to the payroll tax cut extension, I just -- we may be here through Christmas, but it would take an awful lot of chutzpah as well as, perhaps, political courage to go home, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a senator or a congressman, and answer the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you vote to raise my taxes on January 1st?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.\xc2\xa0 You thought better --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m amending my remarks, yes, based on what you said there.\xc2\xa0 I was thinking about the payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 The President said yesterday that if it comes to him attached with \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d issues not related to making sure the American people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something he\xe2\x80\x99s going to accept.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get clarity on that.\xc2\xa0 He would accept it if it\xe2\x80\x99s attached to issues like unemployment insurance and the doc fix, right -- things you want?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d is something you know when you see.\xc2\xa0 And clearly, unemployment insurance is very much an element of the same kind of proposal the payroll tax cut extension and expansion is, and that it goes directly to assisting Americans make ends meet, and it has extremely positive impacts on the economy, on economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Keystone project is being reviewed in a process that was established through many decades of precedent at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 It is being reviewed in a way that allows and has allowed for substantial public comment, as well as input from agencies across the government.\xc2\xa0 And it is being reviewed in a way that takes into consideration the criteria that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President himself lay out as the most important criteria to be considered.\xc2\xa0 That process needs to be allowed to be pursued, and the State Department has said that that will take a certain amount of time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what should happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt should not be, as the President said, a situation where leaders in Congress -- Republican leaders in Congress should be bargaining for political priorities in exchange for giving this President the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Whatever happened to Republicans being for tax cuts?\xc2\xa0 Is it because this one goes to 160 million Americans, middle-class working Americans, that they\xe2\x80\x99re ambivalent or they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to oppose it if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get some political scalp?\xc2\xa0 Is it because President Obama supports it, or Democrats support it?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s confusing to me, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s confusing to a lot of people, and based on the data I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it\xe2\x80\x99s confusing to a lot of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo no extraneous attachments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that cover, for example, some of these environmental issues besides Keystone that Republicans are pushing?\xc2\xa0 Would that be extraneous?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Besides Keystone?\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that something like that would be extraneous.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate from here.\xc2\xa0 Keystone is clearly extraneous.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 You said that it was Kathleen Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s decision on Plan B.\xc2\xa0 We also heard the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on the subject.\xc2\xa0 Did he or anybody else in the White House communicate his views to her before she made the decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is certainly -- broadly speaking, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know with regard to this specific issue, but it\xe2\x80\x99s broadly the case that there is communication between agencies and the White House on matters like these and decisions that are made at those agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services or other departments.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, as the President said, he had no involvement in the process.\xc2\xa0 He supports the decision, and it was very much Kathleen Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did anybody -- I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it was her decision, but there are lots of ways that you can come to a decision --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if I could just finish the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can come to a decision, for instance, after speaking with somebody at the White House who advises that, for any number of reasons, this is something that the White House would prefer.\xc2\xa0 And putting the President himself aside, did anybody on the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The implication in your --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the White House communicate that to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get where you\xe2\x80\x99re headed.\xc2\xa0 The implication in your question is that Kathleen Sebelius doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support this decision.\xc2\xa0 I think you ought to ask her, because she does and she made it.\xc2\xa0 So there is communication between the White House and agencies in a decision-making process like this, but the decision is made by the Secretary in this case, and it was made by Secretary Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 The President had no involvement in that, as he just said, and this was her decision, and I think she put out a statement explaining it.\xc2\xa0 The President supports it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- been in Washington a while, long enough to see Cabinet secretaries make decisions that they don\xe2\x80\x99t personally agree with.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is in the mind of Kathleen Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking whether there was any influence on the part of the White House staff in her coming to that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, again, there was communication.\xc2\xa0 But the implication of your question is that influence to get her to change her mind -- this was her decision.\xc2\xa0 She made it and she clearly supports it, as articulated in her statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee this morning said he wants to see work product from Elena Kagan before -- in a period before it became clear that she was under consideration for the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support -- is there any reason the President feels that those documents should not be turned over in that two-month timeframe?\xc2\xa0 And does he feel that she retains her impartiality in the health care case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Justice Kagan was confirmed with bipartisan support to the Supreme Court; went through the usual thorough confirmation process.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the statement by President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s former attorney general on this matter, and his views on whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s an issue here.\xc2\xa0 We agree with him.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have another Plan B question, but this is a fiscal follow-up on what the President said earlier regarding the eurozone.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a plan B to protect the U.S. economy -- (laughter) -- if its European leaders do not reach an agreement -- a debt agreement tomorrow in Brussels, especially now that S&amp;P is threatening to downgrade all of Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s focused on his plan A, which is passage of the payroll tax cut extension and expansion, passage of extension of unemployment insurance, passage -- if members of Congress come to their senses -- of the other elements of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe will not relent just because there is political opposition.\xc2\xa0 And as he made clear here, he will stay as long as it takes in Washington to make sure that Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow 160 million Americans to experience a tax cut next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that will have a positive effect on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Europe tomorrow during this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you asked what his plan B was for the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and he has said in the past, and Secretary Geithner, is he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the things you can control.\xc2\xa0 You obviously engage on the issues that are not entirely in our control, like Europe.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary Geithner is in Europe this week; why President Obama is in frequent communication with his counterparts in Europe, especially Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, as he mentioned today.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you need to buy that insurance, if you will, for your own economy, for the American economy, by taking the decisive action that you can take, through Congress and outside of Congress, that can help buffer the American economy and protect it from the kinds of shocks that happen inevitably in the global economy -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the situation in Europe, or earthquake and tsunami in Japan, or unrest in the Middle East that affects oil prices.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of things that are not entirely in our control, and that we need to ensure against.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is so essential that we take the measures we can take to ensure that we continue to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to put $1,550 in the pockets of the average American family next year, and why we need to make sure that those 5 million folks who are looking for work continue to get the kind of assistance they need.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the way in back.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The leaders in Pakistan have been talking about new talks of engagement with the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Have they given you any indication of what these new talks of engagement with the U.S. is going to be, and how is it going to be different from the present one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but, as you know, we have regular contacts with the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new information on those consultations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 plan would charge higher fees to lenders by Fannie and Freddie, which would eventually lead to higher interest rates for borrowers.\xc2\xa0 So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that eventually come down to hurting the middle class in the end?\xc2\xa0 And then also, I wondered if you had any reaction to Governor Perry\xe2\x80\x99s ad vowing to end Obama\xe2\x80\x99s war on religion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction on what sounds like -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As for the Senate Democratic bill, you mean the new --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- payroll tax cut bill?\xc2\xa0 We support it.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward his preferred pay-fors; the Senate Democrats have come forward with alternative pay-fors now, twice, and we support those measures.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this administration has made clear its views on winding down, or -- is that the correct language? -- on reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of specifics with regards to that provision for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because it would end up eventually hitting the middle class --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s in a vacuum perhaps.\xc2\xa0 But there are a lot of other moving pieces with regards to those institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then Scott.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 No, no, you first.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to Mitt Romney specifically calling out the President\xe2\x80\x99s vacation as evidence of his lack of hands-on -- that the only thing he\xe2\x80\x99s hands-on with is his golf club -- and that if he were President he would take a much shorter vacation, which seems to kind of be what\xe2\x80\x99s likely to happen considering what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 But still, this attack coming from Mitt Romney.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to what the President said about the possibility of the holiday vacation for him, and the, I guess, increasing likelihood that it will be shorter than anticipated because he is absolutely committed to working with Congress as well as perhaps forcing Congress to stay here to get the absolutely necessary work it needs to get done, done.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have to say -- because this is obviously criticism to the President for whom I work -- that I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember Governor Romney having a hard time or complaining about this President\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor taking his family on vacation, spending, I believe, far more time on vacation than this President.\xc2\xa0 But you never know what he might have said, so you might want to go check it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei Sitov.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And thank you for your comment on this Russian situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nye za shto.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I must say that the actual comments from my country\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are also much more balanced than they are depicted, and in the U.S. --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we just -- I just -- we just commended President Medvedev for the statements he made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when you actually read what they said, other than what\xe2\x80\x99s reported.\xc2\xa0 But he did make an interesting observation -- I mean Putin in this case -- when he was talking to his supporters.\xc2\xa0 He was responding to questions, and many of those questions were about, see, the Americans keep trying to influence our internal politics, keep spending money on it -- which is true, because I asked Mark Toner the other day at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 He gave me a figure of $9 million that the U.S. spent on supporting the process of elections in Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And then Putin actually said that it\xe2\x80\x99s much higher than that; it\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of millions.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he gets that figure, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike me as impossible, either.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is there a question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The question is, is it sort of -- is it worth it?\xc2\xa0 Why do we want to do this, if this provokes this sort of reaction throughout the world?\xc2\xa0 And I mean -- you are speaking out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s understandable.\xc2\xa0 But actually spending money on this?\xc2\xa0 Like I asked you yesterday about this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to find a question in there and respond to it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The State Department has a long history of engagement with countries around the world and the democratic process.\xc2\xa0 It should not come as a surprise to anyone that we, the United States of America, support democracy for everyone around the world -- and that we have made clear in our improved relationship with Russia the importance of our common interests, the successes that I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve reported on and everyone here has reported on, that we have had working with Russia on a number of important issues.\xc2\xa0 But we also have sought to deepen our engagement with Russian society and promote universal values.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is -- that both of those pursuits can proceed and be complementary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s closer to the truth, the $9 million or the hundreds of millions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would take the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s word for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And then I said Scott.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re next and then Scott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Take a shot on the Middle East again because the President was asked about appeasement, which is sure to make headlines in terms of his response, and he had that -- he took some heat from Republicans yesterday on Israel.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Panetta\xe2\x80\x99s remark last week about Israel just needing to get back -- \xe2\x80\x9cget to the damn table,\xe2\x80\x9d does that pretty much sum up --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, first of all, I will say that was a reported remark from a private meeting, as I understand it.\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me in general, is our view that both sides need to get to the table, the answer is, yes.\xc2\xa0 We support direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made that abundantly clear.\xc2\xa0 We support steps taken by both sides that make that more likely, and we oppose steps taken by either side that make it less likely, that make it harder to accomplish.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that more kind of over the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on a remark -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s true as reported.\xc2\xa0 So -- but broadly speaking, do we want Palestinians and Israelis to engage in negotiations and to reach a lasting peace deal that ensures Palestinian sovereignty and Israeli security?\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0 We do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, Scott, sorry.\xc2\xa0 I have short-term memory lapse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both you and the President talked about how the FDA recommendation would have put Plan B on the -- made it as accessible as bubble gum.\xc2\xa0 So Tylenol and cold medicine are also sold alongside bubble gum.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that emergency contraceptive, because of its function, is in a different category than those other OTC medicines?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate on what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I think he was fairly clear.\xc2\xa0 And on the more specific evaluations of this, I would point you to Secretary Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more guidance for you than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:31 P.M.
