Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s pretty good when the opening act brings its own seal and flags. \xc2\xa0So, Josh, do you want to get us started with our regularly scheduled programming here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Let\'s go back to the Panama Papers for a minute. \xc2\xa0The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned, facing questions about potential conflict of interest regarding his funds disclosed as a result of these papers. \xc2\xa0Do you think that step was called for? \xc2\xa0Do you think that there are other leaders that also may need to step aside in the wake of these disclosures?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of what the newly released documents indicate about the financial situation of any world leaders, let alone the leader of Iceland. \xc2\xa0Obviously that was a decision that the leader of Iceland made based on a variety of considerations. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific comment on that ultimate decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously there are a lot of materials that have been released and that will continue to be reviewed by the general public and certainly by many of your news organizations. \xc2\xa0As the President noted, it does sort of highlight some issues that the President has been focused on for quite a long time. \xc2\xa0And I did actually want to add to one aspect of his answer about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are some specific steps that the administration has succeeded in implementing that has been effective in countering some of the international tax avoidance schemes that were revealed in the context of this document. \xc2\xa0Many of you will recall -- or at least some of you will recall, in 2010 the President signed into law the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. \xc2\xa0FATCA was a piece of legislation that this administration aggressively pushed Congress to pass. \xc2\xa0This was legislation that was targeted at countering tax evasion by U.S. taxpayers using offshore accounts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe benefits of this legislation were significant in a variety of ways. \xc2\xa0Let me discuss a couple of them. \xc2\xa0The first is that the law actually prompted countries around the world to begin reciprocal financial information-sharing agreements. \xc2\xa0That\'s beneficial because there are now 112 countries that exchange information with the United States about financial transactions that are occurring in their countries that were initiated, or at least that involve the other countries\' citizens. \xc2\xa0So this is helpful in getting -- in providing greater transparency into the details of these financial transactions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as a result, more than 150,000 foreign financial institutions have now registered under FATCA; 150,000 financial institutions that the U.S. government now has greater clarity into as a result of the effective implementation of FATCA legislation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the legislation, the Department of Justice has a Swiss bank program because of the peculiar regulations that apply to Swiss banks. \xc2\xa0Because of the greater insight that they have obtained through this program, since the end of last month the Department has entered into 78 different agreements with 80 Swiss banks that have paid more than $1.3 billion in penalties. \xc2\xa0And when it relates to the IRS -- that is the agency that\'s chiefly responsible for enforcing these tax regulations -- they have also, because of their efforts, gotten greater insight into the conduct of these specific foreign financial transactions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSince 2009, the IRS has received more than 54,000 offshore voluntary disclosures. \xc2\xa0The disclosures are voluntary because taxpayers understand that the IRS is paying new attention to these kinds of transactions, and people are interested in getting right with the law. \xc2\xa0And so we\'re seeing greater compliance with these laws because of the effective implementation and the effective work of the IRS.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe number of reports that are filed by foreign bank and financial accounts -- these are FBARs, for those who follow these issues closely -- have increased significantly over the last five or six years, from about 330,000 filings in 2008 to more than 1.1 million of them in 2015. \xc2\xa0All told, the IRS has conducted thousands of offshore-related civil audits resulting in millions of dollars of assessments. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Treasury and the IRS has pursued criminal investigations leading to billions of dollars in criminal fines and restitution. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of ways to chronicle the success that this administration has had in cracking down on some of these international tax avoidance schemes that are now in the news in a way that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been previously.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the President points out, we\'re obviously quite focused on those areas and those transactions that are not in compliance with the law. \xc2\xa0But there are significant concerns that are raised by financial transactions that, while technically legal, are egregiously unfair. \xc2\xa0They\'re unfair because these are tax maneuvers that are not available to middle-class families. \xc2\xa0They\'re only available to wealthy individuals or powerful corporations. \xc2\xa0And not only is that unfair, the consequences of these actions leads to significant loss of tax revenue that could otherwise be devoted to improving our schools, making college more affordable, or even putting people back to work building our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the policy questions are significant. \xc2\xa0These are questions that we\'ve been grappling with since the President\'s earliest days in office. \xc2\xa0And, frankly, we\'re pleased that this is an issue that\'s now in the news that\'s getting the kind of attention that it deserves. \xc2\xa0Hopefully it will prompt long-overdue action in the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0Right now, we\'ve got too many Republicans in Congress who are looking out for their wealthy donors or wealthy corporate interests as opposed to pushing for the kinds of policies that would be more fair to middle-class families and better for our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Aside, though, from the issue of tax avoidance and the revenues, does the fact that the leaders of so many key economies -- China, Russia, Argentina -- are now embroiled in this scandal over their finances, are the President\'s economic advisors concerned that that will have some negative effects on the economy or on markets?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any specific concern expressed in the context of this document release. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that one of the leading items on our broader diplomatic agenda is fighting corruption. \xc2\xa0And when the President has traveled to other countries, he\'s talked about how important it is and how beneficial it can be for governments to prioritize transparency measures that will give people greater confidence in the trustworthiness of their government and in senior government officials.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, the United States is a strong advocate for that. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of multilateral fora -- things like ASEAN and even at the U.N. -- where the United States has pushed for higher transparency standards when it comes to good governance. \xc2\xa0That\'s going to continue to be a diplomatic priority. \xc2\xa0Again, I think this would also fall in the category of not a particularly sexy piece of diplomacy but still is important to the broader functioning of the international system -- both of governance and of finance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And China has essentially imposed some type of a media blackout over this issue. \xc2\xa0They\'re not reporting about it in the state media. \xc2\xa0And searches on the Internet for terms related to these Panama Papers have been prohibited. \xc2\xa0Is that something the U.S. is watching? \xc2\xa0Are you raising those concerns about freedom of information with the Chinese government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised a specific concern about this issue. \xc2\xa0But the United States regularly advocates for greater transparency and greater press freedoms around the world, including in China.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to tax inversions. \xc2\xa0Why is this coming out now, since some big deals were in the works back in November and given the administration\xe2\x80\x99s long-term abhorrence of tax avoidance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, look, the President has spoken out quite a bit about how unfair tax inversions are. \xc2\xa0And the President for more than two years has been calling on Congress to update the rules that are on the books that would limit the ability of corporations to essentially renounce their American citizenship, to relocate their business interests, on paper, all in an effort to avoid paying their taxes. \xc2\xa0That\'s not fair. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President has spoken out strongly against it. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans, frankly, spend more time worrying about protecting the tax loopholes that benefit their wealthy contributors as opposed to looking for tax policies that would benefit middle-class families and the broader economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made no bones about our distaste for the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 approach to this policy. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the President I think has spoken in rather colorful terms in the past about this issue. \xc2\xa0And we have seen previous steps by the Treasury Department because the President has said Congress needs to act to close these loopholes and to definitively prevent these kinds of transactions. \xc2\xa0But short of that, the President vowed to use all of the executive authority that\'s vested in the executive branch to take a look at this. \xc2\xa0That authority is vested in the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s the Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, who has been at the forefront of putting in place regulations that could limit the ability of large corporations to benefit from these unfair tax practices. \xc2\xa0And there have been a series of announcements over the last couple of years from the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0This is just the latest one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut at the same time, I think some of the coverage has described these actions as the most significant administrative effort to prevent corporate inversions that the administration has taken. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quibble with that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI certainly have a layman\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of these kinds of decisions. \xc2\xa0But I do think that this announcement that Treasury made at the end of the day yesterday reflects a careful, but aggressive effort to make our tax system more fair. \xc2\xa0And it certainly doesn\'t eliminate the need for Congress to take action. \xc2\xa0But I think it does demonstrate how serious the administration thinks this issue is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the administration worried about getting sued by companies or groups, having these regulations weakened?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly has been a common tactic of our Republican political opponents to sue the administration over policies that they don\'t like. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got full confidence that the kinds of executive actions that were announced yesterday to make our tax system more fair are well within the legal authority of the administration to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one on Syria. \xc2\xa0News today of rebels shot down a Syrian jet, the second one in a month. \xc2\xa0Is this cause for concern?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports. \xc2\xa0And obviously our intelligence community has seen them, as well. \xc2\xa0At this point those are reports that we are not able to corroborate at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are some concerns that these new rules, because they are so aggressive, will also affect foreign investment coming into the U.S. \xc2\xa0The expansion of foreign companies that are here; that that could then affect jobs. \xc2\xa0What do you say about that? \xc2\xa0Obviously, in your view, the breadth was needed for this round. \xc2\xa0But is it possible that this breadth now could have a real chilling effect on foreign investment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I have only a layman\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of these specific policies. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that the Treasury Department did include certain provisions in the regulations that do not dis-incentivize foreign corporations from investing in the United States. \xc2\xa0There essentially is a way to write these rules that would target people who are looking to avoid their tax bill, while not negatively affecting foreign companies that are interested in doing legitimate business inside the United States. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfter all, the administration has actually gone to great lengths to encourage foreign businesses to invest in the United States, to benefit from hiring the best workers in the world. \xc2\xa0We view that as good for our economy. \xc2\xa0We view that as good for job creation. \xc2\xa0And we have put forward a whole set of incentives to encourage companies to locate inside the United States. \xc2\xa0That\'s been beneficial for our economy because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a steady increase in that investment over the last several years, and we want to make sure that that trend continues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also, we just heard the President say in response to the same question from yesterday -- does he feel that Donald Trump and other candidates\xe2\x80\x99 rhetoric has already done damage in terms of the U.S. standing in the world -- and he unequivocally said yes, right off the bat. \xc2\xa0But yesterday you said no. \xc2\xa0So how do you sort of smooth that out? \xc2\xa0What damage is done, if any, by this rhetoric already?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I acknowledged yesterday, the fact is the President does get these kinds of questions from world leaders. \xc2\xa0Secretary of State John Kerry was on television today just indicating that every conversation he has with world leaders includes a conversation about their concerns about the political rhetoric coming from the Republican presidential candidates. \xc2\xa0That is concerning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the point that I was making, Michelle, is that that damage can be mitigated, if not outright eliminated, if the American people choose to elect someone that\'s serious about protecting American values and advancing American interests around the globe in a way that acknowledges the important relationships we have with allies and partners around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric and the rhetoric of other Republican candidates, including Senator Cruz, doesn\'t reflect that. \xc2\xa0That is harmful to the United States. \xc2\xa0But over the long term, electing a successor to President Obama who understands how important those relationships are and how important it is to advocate for and defend consistently good, old-fashioned American values, that\'s going to be good for the country. \xc2\xa0And that will protect our standing in the world. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident this will be an important part of the argument you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President making into the summer and fall.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is confusing, though, because you\'re trying to make the point that you don\'t want this rhetoric, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not good. \xc2\xa0But when we\'re talking about something like damage being done -- I mean, you were quick to say yesterday, no, I don\'t think that the damage has been done, where today the President was just as quick to say, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s damage that has been done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo could you just describe what is the damage? \xc2\xa0Because there are concerns out there -- nobody has been elected yet. \xc2\xa0So what is damaging? \xc2\xa0What exactly is it? \xc2\xa0And how does it affect U.S. standing? \xc2\xa0Or whatever you see the damage --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, look, when you have a political leader who is given a large platform and is using that opportunity to give voice to values that are inconsistent with the kinds of values that the American people have long stood and fought for -- in some cases, we\'re talking about values that American servicemen and women have fought and died for -- that sends a confusing signal. \xc2\xa0And the fact that important conversations that are hosted by the President of the United States or the United States Secretary of State are clouded by these kinds of discussions is not good. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s harmful. \xc2\xa0It makes those meetings less productive than they would otherwise be. \xc2\xa0That\'s what makes the stakes of this next election so important. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd electing a President who does give voice to those values that we\xe2\x80\x99ve long stood for, who does continue to see America has a beacon of human rights and fairness and justice and equality and democracy is a good thing not just for our government here at home, but for the standing of the United States around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you would say that the harm done is in time taken up in conversations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, and I guess the questions that are raised in the minds of world leaders about what it is the United States is willing to stand for. \xc2\xa0And given the platform that people like Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz have used to give voice to values, frankly, that most Americans don\'t stand for is harmful. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s damaging. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, to elect a President who understands that this kind of rhetoric is, in fact, damaging, and that electing a President who does demonstrate a commitment to core American values, again, is critical to making sure we have a government that the American people can be proud of, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also critical to shoring up the kinds of relationships that President Obama over the course of the last seven or eight years has spent repairing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple of times these conversations with world leaders have been brought up in terms of how this is harmful. \xc2\xa0So do you feel that these world leaders now see the U.S. in a different light because of this election cycle?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them exactly how it\xe2\x80\x99s changed their view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s been harm and damage. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of what you see it being, exactly.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a couple of shots at trying to answer your question here, so you\'ve got some material to work with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, just a minute ago, in the aftermath of North Carolina enacting the anti-LGBT law in the state, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant has signed into a law a religious freedom bill seemed to enable sweeping anti-LGBT discrimination. \xc2\xa0Does your sentiment that the North Carolina law is mean-spirited apply to this brand-new Mississippi law?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Chris, I have to acknowledge this is the first I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing of the Mississippi law. \xc2\xa0But if it is as you described, the President and the administration has long been on the side of justice and equality. \xc2\xa0And some of the laws that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen passed that target LGBT Americans are not consistent with those values of fairness and equality. \xc2\xa0And in some cases, those laws are outright mean-spirited, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that most Americans are comfortable with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, again, I think, more importantly, a state like North Carolina in particular, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an influential business community. \xc2\xa0And over the last generation or so, the North Carolina economy has been revitalized because they have turned that state into a magnet for businesses, both in the technology sector but also in the financial sector. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve done that by creating a hospitable business environment. \xc2\xa0Passing laws that put those companies\xe2\x80\x99 employees or their customers at greater risk of being discriminated against is not a hospitable business environment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, the companies themselves are going to pass judgment on this and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to decide what impact this is going to have on any range of decisions that they may make about traveling to the state of North Carolina, about doing business in the state of North Carolina, about locating in the state of North Carolina. \xc2\xa0Businesses are going to have to make those kinds of decisions for themselves. \xc2\xa0But clearly, laws like this will be a factor in those decisions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that the administration -- the agencies are reviewing whether the North Carolina law will impact federal funding for that state. \xc2\xa0Any update on when that\xe2\x80\x99s to be completed? \xc2\xa0And could that investigation apply to other states that are considering similar laws, like the recently enacted law in Mississippi?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to the individual agencies about this. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the individual agencies are taking a look to determine what impact at least the law in North Carolina would have on a range of legal and policy questions that are under their jurisdiction. \xc2\xa0The individual agencies will ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re coordinating with the Department of Justice and with each other to ensure sort of a uniform interpretation of these laws if a legal interpretation is necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the individual agencies for a timeframe about when a decision would be made. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99d also have to ask those agencies about whether or not the law that apparently was signed into law in Mississippi would trigger a similar review.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quibble with the idea that this is the most aggressive action that the President and the administration has taken against inversions. \xc2\xa0This is coming just a few weeks after Pfizer and Allergan planned to do their merger. \xc2\xa0And I know you guys said that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t target one specific company, but why should we not come to the conclusion that you all were not hoping to block this deal from going forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I can say that for two reasons. \xc2\xa0One is this review of -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0Considering what sort of executive action was available to the administration to fight corporate inversions is something that was underway long before the specific deal that you referenced was announced. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is something that has long been in the works in terms of considering what options are available to the Treasury Department to taking steps to close these loopholes. \xc2\xa0And, after all, the Treasury Department is not focused on a specific transaction; they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on specific loopholes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we know that there are corporations that are using these loopholes to avoid paying taxes -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re targeting them in the first place. \xc2\xa0And when I say "them," I mean the loopholes, not the individual transactions. \xc2\xa0But that is the process that has been underway at the Treasury Department for a couple of years now. \xc2\xa0And, as you point out, again, the deal that you announced was something that was just referenced in -- or just announced in the last few weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And there are signs that this deal could be starting to unravel. \xc2\xa0Stock has gone down, and there are analysts who say that stock is basically trading as if the deal was being more or less cancelled. \xc2\xa0I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t comment specifically on stock movements, but would the administration be happy if this deal did not go through or deals like this did not through in the future because of these rules?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it is fair to say that the administration would be pleased if corporate inversions that are undertaken solely to prevent companies from paying their fair share in taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go through. \xc2\xa0That would be a good thing. \xc2\xa0That would be a good thing for our economy, and that would be consistent with the goals of the policy that we announced.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHow this specific policy applies to any deals that have been announced but not yet completed, or any deals that have not yet been announced, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that I think individual analysts can probably speak to better than I can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut as a policy matter, yes, this action is being taken by the United States government to prevent companies from being able to engage in a complicated transaction that would prevent them from paying their fair share in taxes. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what our goal is. \xc2\xa0And how it applies to individual transactions is something I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to, but in terms of our policy goals, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what exactly they are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about Iran and the issue of U.S. dollars being used in transactions -- financial transactions by European foreign financial institutions. \xc2\xa0I know the President said that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the tactic that the U.S. is hoping to take, but I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on if there is a European company or European financial institution that wants to use dollars in its own transactions with Iran. \xc2\xa0Is that something that the U.S. is considering allowing, which it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s allowed right now to go on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me do my best to try to clarify at least a little bit here. \xc2\xa0For the details of your question, you may have to check with the Treasury Department, because they\xe2\x80\x99ll understand how these complex regulations are implemented and what impact they could have on specific or pending transactions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I can say, at least specifically, is that the United States is not preparing to reinstate so-called U-turn authorization. \xc2\xa0This is something that got some attention because we actually did make some policy changes that would allow U-turn transactions with respect to Cuba. \xc2\xa0We are not considering reinstating U-turn authorization with respect to transactions emanating from Iran.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecondly, I can tell you that reports that the United States is considering allowing Iran to get access to the U.S. financial system are false. \xc2\xa0But what we are interested in doing -- and this has been true for almost a year now -- we are interested in making sure that the United States and the rest of the international community lives up to the commitments that we made in the context of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re only prepared to follow through on the commitments that we made because we have verified that Iran has followed through on the commitments that they have made. \xc2\xa0Iran, for example, reduced their nuclear stockpile by 98 percent. \xc2\xa0They unplugged thousands of centrifuges. \xc2\xa0They have taken steps to render their heavy-water plutonium reactor harmless and incapable of producing fuel that could be used for a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are a whole variety of steps that Iran committed to implement, including the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\'s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0Because Iran has followed through on all of those steps, the United States and the rest of the international community has an obligation to follow through on giving them the kind of sanctions relief that we promised in return. \xc2\xa0That\'s something that we\'re going to follow through on. \xc2\xa0But we can do that without reinstating U-turn authorization or giving Iran access to the U.S. financial system.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Congressman Pompeo said yesterday that he\'s considering doing an inquiry to figure out whether or not administration officials, like Secretary of State John Kerry, misled the U.S. Congress when they were saying what\'s in this deal. \xc2\xa0Now that the deal is coming to fruition, they believe in some ways that they may have been misled simply on this issue of dollar transactions and European financial institutions. \xc2\xa0So I\'m wondering if you have a response to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s any evidence to substantiate that kind of claim. \xc2\xa0To the extent that you care about my opinion, I think you should take a rather dim view of that suggestion because Congressman Pompeo -- or however you say his name -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve the deal and certainly didn\'t vote in favor of it. \xc2\xa0So it\'s a little hard for him to suggest that he was misled about a deal he didn\xe2\x80\x99t support in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I am confident in is that the administration has been extraordinarily transparent about the terms of the deal when communicating with Congress about it. \xc2\xa0Time and time again, Congress has been briefed on the details of the deal. \xc2\xa0That was true even while the deal was being negotiated. \xc2\xa0And after the deal was finalized, I know that there were a variety of briefings that were held with interested administration officials. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not Congressman Pompeo took the time to actually attend those briefings, but that would be an interesting fact to learn.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause, in fact, I know that there were actually briefings that were hosted by national security officials for the entire House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0Every member of Congress was given access to a classified briefing, to say nothing of the variety of documents that were provided to members of Congress to take a look at in person. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ve got a lot of confidence in the deal that we have reached with the rest of the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0It\'s going to enhance the national security of the United States. \xc2\xa0It\'s going to enhance the national security of our partners in the region, including our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. \xc2\xa0The President is proud of this foreign policy accomplishment. \xc2\xa0And we are pleased that thus far we\'ve able to verify that Iran has lived up to the agreement that was signed.<br/>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back to the timing of this -- on inversions. \xc2\xa0If this Allergan-Pfizer deal had gone through, the savings would have been close to $40 billion, or in that range. \xc2\xa0It was being called one of the largest inversions of all time. \xc2\xa0Are you really saying that the timing of this move was just purely coincidental?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess for the specifics about the timing, you can check with the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that this kind of action is something that the Treasury Department had been looking at for literally for years. \xc2\xa0Certainly their consideration of the use of this authority predated the announcement of this agreement. \xc2\xa0But again, for specifics on the timing of the announcement, I\'d refer you to the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But to have the President come out at this time, as well, underscores it. \xc2\xa0It\'s not just some Treasury action. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it\'s not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, it\'s a significant one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And it\'s amplified by having the President speak to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you had to be aware of the symbolic resonance --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'re in vigorous agreement on this one, Margaret. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, yeah. \xc2\xa0But that\'s why it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really hold water to say, oh, we\'ve just been waiting and the paperwork is ready to go. \xc2\xa0This was symbolically resonant, this moment. \xc2\xa0And this deal in particular made it so.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- so maybe we finally found the place where you and I disagree, which is simply this: \xc2\xa0That the President has been talking about this issue for more than two years. \xc2\xa0And there has been -- and the reason he started talking about it, frankly, was because there was a new loophole that was carved out by corporations that they were taking advantage of. \xc2\xa0We did see a steady increase in the number of corporate inversion transactions that were being carried out by companies who essentially were renouncing their U.S. citizenship, relocating their operations -- only on paper -- just to avoid paying U.S. taxes. \xc2\xa0And there were a variety of these kinds of transactions that were undertaken prior to this announcement about the Allergan-Pfizer deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\'s been going on for a long time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So the President has been quite outspoken about this. \xc2\xa0And there have been previous Treasury actions that have also been significant, both in 2014 and 2015. \xc2\xa0And there were constant questions about whether there were additional steps that the administration could take to fight inversions. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that Treasury officials have been working on, like I said, for more than two years.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt each stage, the decisions about moving forward with these policies is focused on the specific loophole in question. \xc2\xa0And look, there\'s no denying that the loophole that is closed by this action is one that companies have previously taken advantage of. \xc2\xa0That\'s the reason we\'re closing it in the first place. \xc2\xa0But we\'re not closing it because one specific company is trying to take advantage of the loophole. \xc2\xa0We\'re closing it because --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because the largest tax inversion of all time was about to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'re closing it because a variety of companies have taken advantage of this loophole, and we\'re looking to prevent it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I also ask you on the comments about the proposal made to stop remittances to pay for the wall with Mexico that Trump made? \xc2\xa0The President talked too -- I mean, "Draconian," "wacky," "half-baked." \xc2\xa0Focused specifically on just stopping remittances from Mexican immigrants, would you add "discriminatory" to that? \xc2\xa0Or is that laundry list of problems about where you want?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the entirety of Mr. Trump\'s remarks on this. \xc2\xa0But to the extent that there are any details behind this suggestion, it certainly does sound consistent with the kinds of discriminatory policies and discriminatory rhetoric that has unfortunately been the hallmark of Mr. Trump\'s stump speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tShannon, nice to see you today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Dovetailing off of that, the President seemed to enjoy fielding a question dealing with the GOP field.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think you might have been misreading his body language a little bit. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, no, he enjoyed responding to it, maybe. \xc2\xa0And based on the reports today, that there is some level of angst that he\'s out in the campaign trail -- that there\'s a protracted Democratic primary at this point. \xc2\xa0How anxious is he to be out there campaigning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President is certainly looking forward to the opportunity to make a strong case in favor of a Democratic candidate for President that is looking to build on the important progress that our country has made, both at home and abroad, under President Obama\'s leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President feels that that is a strong case, and I\'m sure the President is looking forward to spending hours talking publicly about the evidence available to describe how exactly the United States can benefit from building on the progress that we\'ve made. \xc2\xa0The case that is made by the Republican candidates for President is to actually roll back that progress by going back to the policies that were in place before President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama feels strongly about making an argument against that, in part because he loves his country and he wants to ensure America succeeds. \xc2\xa0That\'s the most important thing. The second thing is, he obviously feels a little bit of a personal investment. \xc2\xa0He obviously has dedicated the last eight years of his life to focusing on these policies that have led us to make so much progress. \xc2\xa0And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see so much of that work be undone. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is certainly ready to make an affirmative case about the progress that we have made and about the prospects of continuing that progress under a Democratic leadership here in the White House. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say I had not detected significant concern on his part about the longer-than-expected Democratic primary. \xc2\xa0As I\'ve described on a couple of occasions, the longer-than-expected Democratic primary in 2008 actually accrued to the benefit of Democrats in the general election. \xc2\xa0There was a lot of concern right around this time, in 2008, that the protracted Democratic contest between Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama was going to be bad for Democrats. \xc2\xa0But I\'ve often cited the example of the aggressively contested Indiana primary in May of 2008. \xc2\xa0It had been a generation, at least, since an Indiana primary had been so aggressively contested by Democratic candidates. \xc2\xa0But yet, there was a good four- or five-week period where Senator Clinton and Senator Obama were campaigning aggressively in the state of Indiana. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat allowed both of those candidates to get to know that state, to spend some time in those communities making the case for Democratic policies. \xc2\xa0Their campaigns made significant organizational investments in the state, built a grassroots infrastructure that in the general election in 2008 actually yielded important electoral fruit for the Democratic Party because Barack Obama won the state of Indiana and their electoral votes in the 2008 election. \xc2\xa0That ended up being good for the Democratic Party and for the Democratic candidate for President.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\'s too early to predict exactly what the long-term impact will be of this longer-than-expected Democratic primary. \xc2\xa0But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- automatically assume that the impact on the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s electoral prospects will be negative.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On this inversion issue, once again this is an example of the administration using executive action to get something done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because Congress has failed to act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because Congress has failed to act. \xc2\xa0Is there anything that you can point to as we go forward now where the administration expects to get anything done with this Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a little while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through this list -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see if I still have it in here -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s a long list. \xc2\xa0I want to make sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget anything off of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s a list of things to do, not the things getting done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess you asked about sort of is there potential for us to get some things done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is there anything, not potentially -- what\xe2\x80\x99s getting done now --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think right now we see a lot of Republicans in the United States Senate that are not doing their jobs. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has put forward a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court, for example, and we see Republicans basically saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to hold hearings to consider his nomination. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing their jobs in that regard. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to go ask somebody else to try to defend the work ethic of Republicans in the United States Senate right now, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- and I think everybody else here at the White House has -- significant concerns about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are some available opportunities, though. \xc2\xa0Certainly confirming a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court would be something important that the United States Congress could do. \xc2\xa0It would be good for the country. \xc2\xa0It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require anybody to fold on their principles. \xc2\xa0But it would require the United States Senate to do their job. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there are some Republicans in both the House and the Senate that are supportive of that effort. \xc2\xa0We heard some positive comments from Speaker Ryan 10 days or so ago about that legislation. \xc2\xa0We obviously would welcome continued bipartisan work to advance that legislation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is hoping that at some point this year Congress will take action to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0This is a trade agreement with about a dozen other countries in the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0This would have important benefits for the U.S. economy, and the President has made a strong case that Democrats and Republicans should support it. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we can work with Republicans on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut look, we can also fight poverty by expanding the EITC, something Speaker Ryan has talked about. \xc2\xa0We can fight heroin addiction, something the President talked about last week. \xc2\xa0Republicans have been on the campaign trail saying this is a top issue. \xc2\xa0So there are a whole host of issues that we should be able to work together on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why would they give him any victories on any of this in the final months of his administration? \xc2\xa0And isn\xe2\x80\x99t this really the end of that part of this Obama presidency, working with Congress to get things done, and therefore I would expect that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more aggressive executive actions taken to try and nail some of these things down that are still on his to-do list?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly am not going to rule out aggressive executive actions. \xc2\xa0But I will say, in general, the list that I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through, Ron, is not the list of priorities of the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0There are a whole host of things we would love for Congress to do that they won\xe2\x80\x99t do because Republicans are in power, and, frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some different priorities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo closing the inversions loophole, for example, is something we would love for Congress to do. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not standing up here saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to happen. \xc2\xa0In fact, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to because Republicans are so committed to protecting corporate interests as opposed to looking out for middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnother thing that Congress could do that the President believes would be a really good thing would be raising the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0This is a way we could give some of the hardest-working people in America the opportunity to raise a family, save for retirement, send their kids to college, buy a house. \xc2\xa0And right now, the minimum wage is so low that if you are the head of a family of four and you\xe2\x80\x99re working full-time making minimum wage, you\xe2\x80\x99re raising that family below the poverty line. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not right, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that Congress should address. \xc2\xa0But again, Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t demonstrated a willingness to considering that kind of proposal, again, because their corporate benefactors don\xe2\x80\x99t support it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a whole host of things we would like to see Congress do. \xc2\xa0But those things weren\xe2\x80\x99t on my list. \xc2\xa0The things that were on my list were actually things that Republicans themselves say that they support. \xc2\xa0These are things that Republicans themselves in many cases have previously been on the record supporting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the question really for Republicans is, are they willing to do their job? \xc2\xa0Are they prepared to demonstrate that they can be entrusted to govern the greatest country in the world? \xc2\xa0And if not, I think voters may have something to say about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just lastly, on Judge Garland, the meeting with Senator Collins just wrapped up. \xc2\xa0It was \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d as I\xe2\x80\x99m reading, they say, so on and so forth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any, today, news about any other movement by any Republicans on the Hill in a very positive direction towards actually not just meeting -- let\xe2\x80\x99s start with meeting and then a hearing and a vote -- on the Judge Garland issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I made a reference to Senator Cornyn\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday. \xc2\xa0I mean, he is somebody who has acknowledged that it\xe2\x80\x99s a slippery slope for Republicans. \xc2\xa0That is why I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so many Republicans, including Leader McConnell, rule out having any sort of private meeting with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0Because it is a slippery slope -- that once you have a private meeting, then it starts to beg questions, well, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have a conversation with Chief Judge Garland in public? \xc2\xa0You say that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got tough questions you want to ask him, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to ask him these questions over breakfast, for example. \xc2\xa0Well, okay. \xc2\xa0Those kinds of private meetings are sort of part and parcel of the regular process for considering a nominee, but why would you have those conversations in private? \xc2\xa0And why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you let the American people get the benefit of seeing that exchange? \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more on his calendar?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans who indicate that the American people should have some sort of voice. \xc2\xa0Well, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the American people, if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make their voices heard, have the opportunity to actually hear directly from Chief Judge Garland? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere haven\xe2\x80\x99t been that many concerns that have been raised by Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody with impeccable legal credentials. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that\xe2\x80\x99s described by Republicans as a consensus candidate. \xc2\xa0But to the extent that people have concerns about his nomination, he should have the opportunity to talk about them in public.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to do exactly that, under oath, on camera, in front of the American people, for hours at a time. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to take tough questions from Democrats and Republicans, from the left and the right, to explain his approach. \xc2\xa0He is somebody who has a track record -- who has demonstrated that he understands the role of a judge is to interpret the law, not to advance a political agenda. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, as it relates to the process, Chief Judge Garland met with a couple of Republicans today. \xc2\xa0You mentioned his meeting with Senator Collins; he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senator Boozman later today. \xc2\xa0And we have seen Chairman Grassley from the Judiciary Committee indicate that the committee is prepared to accept the questionnaire when he fills it out. \xc2\xa0So that sort of is another step in this process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would anticipate that there will be additional meetings with additional Republican senators over the next couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0There are still a dozen or so other senators, beyond the three now, that Chief Judge Garland will have met with by the end of the day today who have also indicated an openness to a meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the other thing about this is it\xe2\x80\x99s also going to start to beg questions for other Republican senators. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s take one example. \xc2\xa0Senator Boozman from Arkansas has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing, just out of good, old fashioned courtesy -- and I think probably a commitment to doing his job -- that Senator Boozman has agreed to have a meeting with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0Well, where does that leave Senator Cotton? \xc2\xa0Is he not going to show that same old-fashioned Southern hospitality to Chief Judge Garland? \xc2\xa0Is he somehow concerned about even having a private meeting with the Chief Judge?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0But it certainly begs that question now that his colleague from the great state of Arkansas has agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0And I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what Senator Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s response to it is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, I think Senator Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to have the meeting thus far is an indication that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to edge farther out on the slippery slope that Senator Cornyn has described.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping you can tell me a little bit about the incident with Boko Haram and their kidnapping of girls in 2014, and what the U.S. has done since that time to help get the girls back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tara, obviously the United States government has been quite concerned about the tactic that Boko Haram has used to terrorize communities all across Nigeria. \xc2\xa0And the United States has been strongly supportive of the Nigerian government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to find those girls, but frankly, to find the large number of people that have been kidnapped by Boko Haram.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States has some areas of expertise that we can leverage to assist in that search. \xc2\xa0So there have been military resources that have been committed to Nigeria to offer some intelligence assistance and some training to Nigerian security forces. \xc2\xa0The United States has also offered some assistance in helping Nigeria set up programs that would allow the victims of these acts of terror to recover. \xc2\xa0And some of these individuals have just been through unthinkable situations. \xc2\xa0And the humanitarian assistance that they need and the recovery to which they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled is something that the United States can assist the Nigerian government in providing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy to combat terrorism has been to build up the capacity of local forces in countries around the world that are partners of the United States, like Nigeria, to do a better job of providing for the security situation in their own country, to protect their citizens and to root out terrorists. \xc2\xa0And the United States is committed to assisting the Nigerians and other countries in Africa that have submitted military resources to combatting this terror threat in Africa. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two political questions. \xc2\xa0First, you spoke of world leaders expressing their concerns about some of the statements of the Republican presidential candidates. \xc2\xa0I\'d like you to flesh it out for us. \xc2\xa0Has, for example, President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico or any of the Latin American leaders voiced to the President or Secretary Kerry their concerns about his -- Mr. Trump\'s call for building a wall?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico, I have seen him publicly express his concerns about this specific policy proposal. \xc2\xa0And I know that at least one of his predecessors, former President Vicente Fox, has expressed some concerns about -- and I think he puts it mildly particularly as it relates to President Fox\'s comments -- some concerns about Mr. Trump\'s proposals.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as President Obama just acknowledged when he was standing up here, obviously the United States has an important economic relationship with Mexico. \xc2\xa0And it is in our country\'s interest to see the Mexican economy continue to at least be healthy, because if it starts to collapse, you would see a much greater influx of migrants from Mexico into the United States, at least headed this direction. \xc2\xa0And that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for Mexico or the United States. \xc2\xa0So that\'s just one example.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have details of private conversations to share with you. \xc2\xa0But look, we\'ve seen Mr. Trump\'s comments about barring Muslims from entering the United States; Mr. Trump\'s comments about suggesting it would be just fine with him if countries in Asia, including allies of the United States, like Japan and South Korea, started to develop their own nuclear program. \xc2\xa0We\'ve seen him advocate for the breakup of NATO, for example -- or at least the U.S. withdrawal from NATO. \xc2\xa0I think I\'ve covered just about every region of the world now. \xc2\xa0And these are comments that he\'s offered up in just the last week or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s a particular surprise to any of you that world leaders have expressed these concerns to people like President Obama or to Secretary Kerry. \xc2\xa0I think in many cases you\'ve heard these world leaders express these concerns publicly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question on this. \xc2\xa0I was in Pennsylvania over the weekend, and the President created quite a bit of news when he, along with Vice President Biden, made a near-unprecedented step of endorsing Ms. Katie McGinty for the Democratic nomination for the Senate over former Congressman and narrow 2010 loser, Joe Sestak. \xc2\xa0Now, the President did endorse one or two incumbent House members who had primaries in 2010. \xc2\xa0But more often than not, he does not get involved in primaries unless an incumbent is there. \xc2\xa0What led him to make this decision? \xc2\xa0And has he received any comments back from Pennsylvania Democrats, including Mr. Sestak?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we talked about this a little bit last week, that there are other Senate races that are in the midst of primaries where the President has weighed in with an endorsement. \xc2\xa0Florida is a good example. \xc2\xa0There is a vigorous Democratic primary going on in Florida right now, and the President weighed in in support of Congressman Patrick Murphy from Florida, even though --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Or Congressman Grayson, another Democrat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Correct. \xc2\xa0So there are a couple of examples where the President has weighed in in Democratic primaries. \xc2\xa0And I think in each case, the President and his team have carefully considered the record and agenda that is being put forward by the individual candidates. \xc2\xa0And in some cases, the President and the Vice President have chosen to weigh in. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have more detail to share with you about Ms. McGinty\'s race beyond what was included in the public statement. \xc2\xa0But obviously those kinds of public statements are carefully considered, and I think that\'s why voters in these individual states where the President does weigh in should recognize that that\'s a carefully considered decision. \xc2\xa0And the President only makes a decision to weigh in when he feels strongly about the benefits of one particular candidate. \xc2\xa0In most cases, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be considered a criticism of the other Democrats. \xc2\xa0In some cases, it might. \xc2\xa0But in many cases, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be viewed as a criticism of any of the candidates, but rather the President\'s strong feelings about the potential of the candidate that he endorsed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have primaries until September. \xc2\xa0Can we expect any other involvement in the internecine races for the Senate or House on the President\'s behalf between now and then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m confident that there will be additional endorsements. \xc2\xa0I, at this point, don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I can\'t telegraph at this point about whether or not there will be additional contested primaries where the President will weigh in, but I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that prospect.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ll just do a couple more. \xc2\xa0Dave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the Garland nomination. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell and Senator Cornyn both said today that essentially all the money and advertising in grassroots activism that progressives had done during the Easter recess to compel Republicans to accept the confirmation hearing for the nominee were a wasted effort, because we started the Easter recess two weeks ago with three Republican senators talking about allowing confirmation hearings, and now we\'re back to two. \xc2\xa0Do you disagree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do disagree with that assessment primarily because I think what we have seen is actually a significant change in the position of many Republican senators when it comes to the prospect of having a private meeting with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0Traditionally, the private meeting is the first step in the confirmation process. \xc2\xa0So we were certainly pleased to see now more than a dozen Republican senators come out and indicate a willingness to meet with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0I recognize that many of them hastened to add that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for him, but they also -- many of them, not all of them -- but many of them started out by saying that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet with him.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that is at least one evidence in the kind of change that we\'ve seen. \xc2\xa0I mentioned earlier the openness of the Senate Judiciary Committee to accepting the questionnaire from Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0And I think what we will continue to see is continued pressure on Republicans. \xc2\xa0I made the reference to Senator Cotton. \xc2\xa0It begs questions now that he has met with Senator Boozman about whether or not Senator Cotton will participate in the same meetings. \xc2\xa0And once a number of these meetings have taken place, then it\'s going to start to beg the question, "Well, why do Republicans want to have all these private conversations with Chief Judge Garland, but yet they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have those conversations in public?" Exactly what is it they\'re concerned about? \xc2\xa0Are they concerned that they don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have tough questions for Chief Judge Garland? \xc2\xa0Are they concerned that Chief Judge Garland would do so well in public that it would be very difficult for them to oppose him if the vote came to the floor? \xc2\xa0I\'m not really sure exactly what the explanation is. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what\'s true is, we have seen -- in editorials and in news stories, and even in polls -- that the position that Republicans have taken to not do their job is extraordinarily unpopular. \xc2\xa0I think I have a pretty good explanation for that. \xc2\xa0The only explanation they can put forward for why they\'re not doing their job is because the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. told them not to do their job. \xc2\xa0As Mr. Trump can attest, the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. is not particularly popular right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it would be a tough case to make to voters in an election year that you\'re not going to do your job under any circumstances. \xc2\xa0But when your best explanation is I\'m not going to do my job because the Republican leader in the Senate told me not to, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there are many Republican voters, let alone Democrats and independents, who are going to find that an acceptable explanation. \xc2\xa0And I think that is why we\'re going to continue to see the pressure on Republicans continue to ramp up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'re going to continue to make a strong case -- not that Republicans should do the President a favor, not that the Republicans should somehow fold on their principles, but rather than Republicans should just do their job. \xc2\xa0They should meet with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0They should give him a hearing. \xc2\xa0And they should give him an up or down vote. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is exactly what Democrats did back in 1988. \xc2\xa0That was the last time that there was a President in office who was calling on the Senate to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court in their last year in office. \xc2\xa0Democrats had the majority at the time; President Reagan was in office. \xc2\xa0Democrats at the time confirmed Justice Kennedy; they did so unanimously. \xc2\xa0We\'re looking to -- we\'re only asking Republicans to meet the same standard that Democrats did when the show was on the other foot, and we\'re only asking Republicans to fulfill their basic constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0And we\'re only asking Republicans to consider the nomination of somebody that Republicans themselves has described as a consensus candidate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand why this is complicated, but I do understand why it\'s so difficult for Republicans to assume a position of saying I\'m not even going to consider the guy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President\'s event in Chicago, on Thursday, do you expect him to make those arguments that you just outlined, or talk about the judge\'s qualifications more? \xc2\xa0Or is he going to start going after individual Republican senators like you are today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not sure that I\'ve gone after Republican senators.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'ve been a little more specific than usual.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'ve been a little more specific. \xc2\xa0I would not anticipate that the President would be particularly specific. \xc2\xa0I think the President is interested in making a broader legal argument in the context of a law school where he previously taught constitutional law about the importance of the United States Senate doing its job and the impact that that has on public confidence in the Court -- and not just the Supreme Court, but actually the entire federal judicial system. \xc2\xa0If it gets overly politicized and starts to break down on party lines, that\'s going to undermine the public confidence in the notion that when it comes to interpreting the law and the rule of law, that politics should be set aside. \xc2\xa0And so you will hear the President talk a little bit more about this, and I think it\'s an important argument for the American people to hear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of constitutional law, Secretary Clinton recently referred to the topic of abortions, saying that the unborn person doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a constitutional right. \xc2\xa0Does the President agree with her on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President certainly talked about his view of a woman\'s right to make her own health care decisions. \xc2\xa0And I recognize this has gone through the wringer quite a bit. \xc2\xa0I did not see the comments of Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0But we can certainly do the work to pull for you President Obama\'s previous thoughts on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, back in 2008 he said that the topic was above his pay grade, I believe. \xc2\xa0Has he evolved on that by any chance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it sounds like you\'ve done a little more work in looking at his past comments than I have. \xc2\xa0So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a look and we\'ll get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:30 P.M.
