GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We may have to make this one quick because it feels like we\xe2\x80\x99re, as I would say, getting closer to the ground on purpose.</p>\n<p>Fire away.\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s got something?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, with regulatory reform now building on the health care bill, the stimulus bill, how can the President try and capitalize on these wins over the last year and a half heading into November?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, before we get to November, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about where we\xe2\x80\x99re heading right now, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re heading into, obviously, as you heard the President just say, this series of meetings which are the premier economic forum in the world.\xc2\xa0 And the President goes first having led the world in Recovery Act, in dealing with the financial system, under the leadership of the economic team and Secretary Geithner, in dealing with our banking system, and now we head to this important meeting at a very important time economically in the world leading again on financial reform.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly important to note.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of your broader question, Julianna, I would say you have a -- I would add one more to the list that you put in there, and that is the reforms that have been done in education, both in K-12 and in college loans, represent probably as significant a reform in our educational system as we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.</p>\n<p>So, look, the President has accumulated in 17 months an impressive record of getting things done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s helped turn our economy around and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing growth and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing job creation again.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got new rules for banks and our financial system so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have what caused this disaster -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a repeat of that; obviously education and health insurance reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- the short of it is the President said coming into office that we were going to get all those things done, and we\xe2\x80\x99re on the cusp of all four of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But yet it still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have resonated with the public.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the conference closed at 5:40 a.m. this morning, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about reg reform, but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 There will be a significant time and place to have a debate about the actions of the last 17 months -- or at that point, the last two years and the President will be a forceful voice in that debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, I think if you wanted to see -- if you want to see a situation that illuminates where these two parties are, for the third time the Senate tried simply to extend unemployment benefits to those who have, because of what happened to our economy, they\xe2\x80\x99re part of the long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 And for the third time, that was blocked.\xc2\xa0 And I think that says a lot about who you\xe2\x80\x99re in Washington fighting for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, any plans to add to the bilats?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some talk that there may be a breakfast tomorrow morning between the President, French, German, and the British leaders to kind of clear the air.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Kind of clear the air about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s some amount of pushback from the Germans about fiscal austerity and calls from the United States to do more to accelerate the economy.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'ve heard different talk about the schedule.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll try to nail down if anything else has been added.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'d go through the first part of my original answer, which is we took some -- the President took some very bold steps.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s led to economic growth; it\xe2\x80\x99s led to a stabilization of our financial system.\xc2\xa0 And now we have -- now we lead the world in financial reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I\'m sure the President looks forward to seeing all of those leaders, but we go to this meeting with a strong record of having identified and taken care of a number of our problems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the financial reform bill being passed today make the case for global recovery?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a significant reform of the biggest -- of the financial system in the biggest economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 I think it demonstrates to the world the steps that we have to continue to take globally in order to ensure that we don\'t find ourselves in a situation like we did two years ago -- and just a tremendously important step as we come here to discuss the state of the recovering world economy.</p>\n<p>All right, guys, I\'m going to go sit down.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:19 A.M.
