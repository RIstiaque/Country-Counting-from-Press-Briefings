CDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hey, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for sticking around.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do now is read out the first NATO session, which was a North Atlantic Council that focus on NATO defense capabilities.\xc2\xa0 We have with us Ambassador Ivo Daalder, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, and the man who sang \xe2\x80\x9cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\xe2\x80\x9d at Wrigley Field last night.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will have the ISAF session on Afghanistan in the morning, and then he will have the session with NATO partners in the -- falling then in afternoon, and then he\'ll hold the press conference.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll keep you updated on those developments tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll turn it over to Ivo to do the defense capabilities pieces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 And thanks, all, for staying up and out here.\xc2\xa0 There\'s another ballgame that you missed, but I was in the NAC; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnyway, 18 months ago we had our last summit at NATO at Lisbon in which we agreed to set the stage to revitalize the Alliance, ready for the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 We would try to ensure, to figure out how NATO could be ready, fit for purpose, for the threats that we face today and tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And we decided there that we would deploy and develop a NAC territorial missile defense system, that we would pursue a set of critical capabilities to make the Alliance ready to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, and to do an overall review of our deterrence and defense posture.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt Chicago, we are delivering on the promises that we had in Lisbon.\xc2\xa0 The leaders today, in the first formal NAC session, took stock of where we stand, and they made a number of fundamental decisions to make sure that NATO will have the right capabilities.\xc2\xa0 NATO will develop what we call a NATO Forces 2020 concept -- a concept whereby NATO, in 2020, eight years from now, will have and continue to have the capabilities necessary to address the threats that we -- and the challenges that we face.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also adopted a Deterrence and Defense Posture Review that showed what the appropriate mix of conventional nuclear and missile defense forces should be in order to advance our deterrence and defense capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And we agreed that NATO should be prepared to considered reciprocal reductions in non-strategic nuclear forces deployed in Europe.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAmong the critical capabilities that we focused on today in the session and that was decided, was the decision regarding missile defense.\xc2\xa0 The leaders, at the end of the session, declared that they would agree to have an interim NATO ballistic missile defense capability.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 It means that NATO will now have an operationally meaningful ballistic missile defense mission.\xc2\xa0 It will be limited in the initial phase, but it will expand over time.\xc2\xa0 It will, as of today, provide real protection for parts of NATO Europe against ballistic missile attack.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe agreed to a set of command and control procedures for ballistic missile defense.\xc2\xa0 We designated the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, Admiral Jim Stavridis, as the commander for the ballistic defense mission.\xc2\xa0 We have tested and validated the command and control capability by all 28 allies.\xc2\xa0 We have agreements with four countries -- Spain, Turkey, Romania, Poland -- to host U.S. missile defense assets.\xc2\xa0 Allies themselves have committed to invest over $1 billion in command and control and communications infrastructure needed to support the NATO ballistic missile defense system.\xc2\xa0 And the President has directed the transfer of the operational control of the radar in Turkey to NATO.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tU.S. missile defense ships are already in the Mediterranean and they are able to operate under NATO command -- under NATO operational control when necessary in a crisis.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I said, this is the beginning of the deployment of ballistic missile defenses.\xc2\xa0 The initial operating -- operational capability should be achieved by 2015; and by 2018, we will have a fully operational capability for NATO ballistic missile defense.\xc2\xa0 This decision, which we had agreed would need to be taken in Lisbon, now means that NATO has, for the first time, a theatre -- a territorial missile defense capability.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere were other critical capability decisions that we made. Just a few minutes ago, NATO signed a contract to acquire the Alliance Ground Surveillance system.\xc2\xa0 These are five Global Hawk drones that provide the kind of surveillance capability that we saw in the Libya operation was so vital to the effective operation of our military.\xc2\xa0 Then, we relied on the United States to provide it; in the future, NATO will have the capacity to deploy these drones.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also agreed to extend the Baltic air policing mission.\xc2\xa0 The President noted the importance of having allies providing aircraft to police the Baltic states so that the Balts can invest their resources in other -- into other operations, including their very important commitment to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we supported the Smart Defense Initiative by the Secretary General, where, in a time of austerity, we are promoting more specialization and more multilateral cooperation in order to make sure that the European defense euro or krone, or, indeed, the U.S. dollar goes further than it would if we were spending it by ourselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFinally, as part of the Deterrence and Defense Posture Review, as I said, we looked at our nuclear posture, as well as our conventional and our missile defense posture.\xc2\xa0 With regard to the nuclear posture, we reaffirmed, as we did in Lisbon, that NATO will remain a nuclear alliance for as long as nuclear weapons exist, and as long as we have nuclear weapons that those weapons will be safe, secure and effective.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we also affirmed that NATO will look at ways to reduce<br/>\n\t-- further reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we recognized the value of national negative security assurances -- assurances that the United States and other nuclear powers have made that we will not threaten -- use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against other state -- non-nuclear weapon states who are in full compliance with their NPT, nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we agreed that we would pursue further reductions on a reciprocal basis of nuclear weapons in Europe.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo those were the major decisions that leaders reached today.\xc2\xa0 As I said, they were the implementation of the kinds of vision that we had laid out in Lisbon 18 months ago.\xc2\xa0 In that sense, we promised in Lisbon; and in Chicago, we were able to deliver.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\'m happy to take some questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could tell us what the discussion about Syria consisted of, and whether there was any indication that Turkey, as it has said publicly recently, would discuss implementation or application of Article IV or indeed Article V?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 There was no discussion in the session today about Syria.\xc2\xa0 And there was -- Turkey raised issues on -- related to capabilities, did not raise the issue of Syria or Article IV or Article V.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about why there was virtually no talk formally within the Alliance about Syria?\xc2\xa0 The Secretary General said that NATO has absolutely no intention of taking any action inside Syria.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering -- many on the Hill, some of your predecessors have said that\xe2\x80\x99s a really bad signal to send to President Bashar al Assad given the fact that you have recognized that the Annan plan isn\'t working, and he feels that he can completely continue with impunity because there\'s absolutely no credible threat of military action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 As I said, the issue didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.\xc2\xa0 There are, at present, no planning going on that\xe2\x80\x99s related to a NATO role in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The situation in Syria is, indeed, a negative one.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to find ways to pressure -- put pressure on the regime, to abide by the Annan plan, to implement it.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to find different ways of pressure.\xc2\xa0 And at the moment, that does not include a active discussion on NATO issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think it\'s a wise idea to publicly say that you have absolutely no intention of doing anything like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, let me say a couple things on this.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as it relates to NATO planning, a NATO ally has to come forward and request that type of planning.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a circumstance that hasn\'t taken place.\xc2\xa0 We\'d obviously take any requests of that nature seriously if it were to be made.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'ll be monitoring going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think with respect to Syria, I\'d say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we have, within the framework of the Annan plan, an international community that\xe2\x80\x99s working to stop the violence within Syria, but also, at the G8, we made a point of elevating the need for a political transition to get underway within Syria, because it\'s our belief that you\'re not simply going to stop the violence within Syria by putting monitors into the country -- as important as that is -- to bring the violence down; that there needs to be a credible political transition process that gets underway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the G8 focused on this as a major topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0 It was one of the principal topics at the leaders dinner, and the decision was taken out of there to elevate the focus on a political transition.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSeparate and apart from the Annan plan, we\'ve been working through the "Friends of Syria" process so that the United States, together with like-minded countries, can apply pressure on the Syrian regime, precisely because we are so concerned about the situation there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what we\'ve done together with our European allies, our Arab partners -- and, of course, within that context Turkey plays an important role as well -- is provide assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 That includes political and diplomatic support.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has also taken the step of providing non-lethal assistance, such as communications equipment, medical equipment, humanitarian assistance as well as, again, helping them determine a road map for an inclusive future within Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve also coordinated sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you look at the pressure that has had the most effect on the Assad regime to date, it\'s the fact that they are seeing a significant drop in their revenues and their ability, ultimately, to sustain themselves because of the coordinate sanctions that we\'ve done through the "Friends of Syria" grouping.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'ve also decided, however, that a military intervention of the nature that we did in Libya would further militarize the situation in ways that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily protect civilian life; that unlike Libya, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have pockets of the country that can be protected by civilian protection zones, you\'ve got security forces intermingled with the population; and that introduction of greater military intervention from outside or arms to groups within Syria could further militarize the conflict in a counterproductive way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our focus right now is working on the tracks that we have.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s send a clear message that there needs to be an end to the violence.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s get monitors in the country to support that initiative.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s begin a political transition, and within that context, let\'s also provide support to the Syrian opposition and let\'s continue to put pressure on the Assad regime, including through a very robust and coordinated set of sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two weeks ago, in front of the council on foreign relations, you said you were convinced that French troops would be still in Afghanistan in the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 I would like to know if you are disappointed, and if you feel the specifics the French have been given -- the assurance that\'s been given to you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 I think what I said is that troops, French troops, would still be in Afghanistan in 2014.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, President Hollande has announced that he will fulfill his campaign pledge of withdrawing combat troops, but there will remain a presence within the NATO-led mission of ISAF through the end of that mission, which is the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 And in that regard, I think France has fulfilled -- has continued to remain committed to the decision we laid out in Lisbon, which was \xe2\x80\x9cin together, out together.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe way in which countries contribute to the mission will evolve, ours will evolves, ever country\xe2\x80\x99s will evolve.\xc2\xa0 And France will, in the future, focus more on training than it has in the past, and that is perfectly appropriate because we are increasingly shifting responsibility to the Afghan national security forces for the security of the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- with the United States troops after 2014?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question you will have to ask the French President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And just to add to that, the NATO-ISAF combat mission is obviously concluding at the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 I think individual nations are going to make -- just as NATO will -- individual nations are going to make their own decisions about what their partnership is going to be with Afghanistan after 2014.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFrance does have a strategic partnership agreement with the Afghans so we fully expect that France will continue to be a supporter of Afghanistan, of its government, into the future.\xc2\xa0 And as Ivo said, and as we addressed before, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re understanding of the fact that different nations make different decisions about their national actions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe do believe that France can continue to be a credible partner and an important part of the ISAF mission in ways such as training, advising, instructing after their combat -- particularly combat role is concluded.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see any steps towards NATO expansion at this summit, and if so, what will they be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 We will address the issue of the aspirant countries, countries who aspire to be part of NATO, both in our communiqu\xc3\xa9 and, importantly, we will have a meeting tomorrow with those four countries:\xc2\xa0 Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Georgia.\xc2\xa0 And we will have a discussion at foreign minister level about their aspirations, about how they are making progress towards membership.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAn actual invitation to membership will not issued at this summit -- this was never going to be an enlargement summit -- but we are fully supportive of the efforts of countries who want to become members of NATO, as we are supportive of countries to have a partnership with NATO when they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to necessarily join NATO.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd those are the kinds of issues we will address both in our partnership meetings tomorrow with our ISAF partners, but the -- a core partner meeting that the President will be present with all the other leaders of 13 countries who are making significant political and military and other contributions to Alliance operations and what the Alliance does.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, as I said, we will have a meeting with four countries that have demonstrated and said that they would like to join the Alliance and see how far they have gone on that path.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to engage with them on an individual basis because it is not a group of countries that will become members of NATO; it is individual countries who will be invited if and when they have made the necessary progress for such an invitation to be extended.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say fully supportive, do you mean that the administration supports them becoming members, or supports them in a more abstract sense -- to apply, to ask for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkans, of other parts of Europe is important and that the prospect of membership by NATO -- for NATO, by these countries is one of the things that entices them to make the necessary political and economic reforms, and military reforms, to contribute to security in the North Atlantic region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Anything else?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more in the back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The interim capability had been talked about for many months before the summit.\xc2\xa0 How specifically does this play into the talks coming up --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 The decision that was made here is to enable NATO to have the command and control of national assets that individual countries can contribute.\xc2\xa0 So the United States would contribute its radar, and in the times of need, would contribute the Aegis-capable ships.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in that sense, the actual capability has existed since the end of 2011, as far as the United States is concerned.\xc2\xa0 Now that capability will be made -- it is possible to make that capability available to NATO.\xc2\xa0 That is the fundamental change, and in that sense it has -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that we have done.\xc2\xa0 We have moved from a U.S. capability that is extent and will continue to exist, to one that is now -- can be made available to NATO and operate under NATO rules of engagement, NATO agreements on how the command-and-control system is supposed to operate, and formally, under the operational control of a NATO commander as opposed to a U.S. commander.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just say one other thing on that.\xc2\xa0 With respect to Iran, when we took office we took a hard look at our missile defense planning and we redesigned a missile defense system that we felt was focused on a careful threat assessment.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it was our assessment that the greatest ballistic missile defense -- or ballistic missile threat to the Alliance and to the United States and our interests was from Iran, for instance.\xc2\xa0 And so we have designed a system that will be focused on threats emanating from that part of the region and particularly from Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that is a system that, of course, is going to continue to come online.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say about this is there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk about missile defense in the United States; there has been for many years.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated in this administration is not just talk on missile defense but action.\xc2\xa0 We see now the deployment of a missile defense system that is transitioning now to the defense of NATO, that ultimately will provide for the defense of Europe and the United States.\xc2\xa0 We have concrete commitments and plans to move forward with the deployment of this system, with four countries already stepping forward to play their part in hosting part of the architecture.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think that today reaffirms, I think, the very strong record that we\xe2\x80\x99ve built on missile defense.\xc2\xa0 And even as we continue to have our differences with the Russians that we would like to work through, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re demonstrating that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward with our plans.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to talk to the Russians, of course, as we do.\xc2\xa0 But today is another milestone in demonstrating that we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about the threat from ballistic missiles.\xc2\xa0 We assess that that threat comes in part from Iran, and that the Alliance as a whole is going to have this capability, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to grow stronger over time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow on that -- and forgive me if you went over some of this -- how far across Europe does the interim capability mean the shield extends?\xc2\xa0 And how is that different from IOC in a couple of years?\xc2\xa0 Where there will be more of Europe covered?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 Right now, it is a part of southern Europe that will be able to be covered.\xc2\xa0 After -- we right now have only ship deployed that is possibly dedicated to NATO.\xc2\xa0 We have the radar in southeast -- in Turkey.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs over time, as more ships come online -- and by 2014 we should have about four ships into the Mediterranean -- that footprint for the defense will extend to larger and larger parts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIOC relates to the command-and-control capability of the NATO system.\xc2\xa0 By 2015, we have said we will deploy land-based Aegis SM-3 interceptors in Romania in 2018; by 2018 in Poland.\xc2\xa0 As you deploy more capability, interceptor capability and more ships with radars, the ability to protect more and more of Europe will increase with the threat moving from short- to medium-range missiles today to intermediate-range ballistic missiles, and in phase four of our system to intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2020.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can you say which countries are protected now in southern Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s an operational kind of decision that because it\xe2\x80\x99s an operational decision we won\xe2\x80\x99t go into.\xc2\xa0 Our ability to protect different countries, because it is a mobile system, exists.\xc2\xa0 And we have looked at the rules of engagement and a defense design for a wide variety of places that could be protected by the fact that the ship can be moved.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We will see you all tomorrow, and, again, kick off in the morning with the ISAF session.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t6:12 P.M.
