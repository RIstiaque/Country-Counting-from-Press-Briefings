Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  2:45 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just make a quick statement on something that the First Lady is going to speak about later this afternoon.<br/> <br/>  Today the administration is kicking off President Obama\'s summer service initiative, United We Serve.\xc2\xa0 United We Serve is a call to all Americans to join a volunteer effort this summer and be part of building a new foundation for America one community at a time.\xc2\xa0 United We Serve officially starts today and runs through the National Day of Service and Remembrance on September 11th.<br/> <br/>  During this summer the President is calling on all Americans to participate in projects that focus on four key areas where everyone can have an impact in their communities:\xc2\xa0 energy and the environment, health care, education, and community renewal.\xc2\xa0 The President and First Lady are calling on all Americans to visit the Corporation for National and Community Services Web site, <a href="http://www.serve.gov">www.serve.gov</a>, to find service projects in their community.<br/> <br/>  To mark the kickoff today the First Lady, as well as 19 Cabinet Secretaries and senior administration officials, are fanned out across the country to participate in a wide variety of service projects to mark this occasion.<br/> <br/>  And with that, Ms. Loven.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On the Medicare prescription drug agreement, is there still -- is there some glitch in that agreement, or still are negotiations going on and would that be why PhRMA wasn\'t represented there today?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would direct you to the finance committee.\xc2\xa0 I think as they say, I think in the story that you wrote, that they\'re still continuing to work through some of the details on that.\xc2\xa0 But again, today\'s event was focused on --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by some of the details?\xc2\xa0 That sounds sort of sketchy.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to talking to Ken, who you\'ve already talked to, and to the finance committee.<br/> <br/>  But again, I think -<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House is party to this, so can\'t you speak about it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- but the legislation that\'s being written up on Capitol Hill -- I do think, though -- again, today represented the endorsement of this broad agreement by the largest group representing seniors in this country to make good not simply on helping seniors that fall into that coverage gap after Part D ends and before catastrophic coverage kicks in, but also to make good on several of the ideas that the President has outlined over the past several weeks in order to make health care more efficient.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly, could you be more clear than you have been about whether the President does still occasionally continue smoking?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t probed any deeper than the statements that I\'ve given you all in the past several days, that, as he has told me, it\'s something that he continues to struggle with as somebody -- like millions of Americans have.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question again on Iran -- two, actually.\xc2\xa0 First of all, Iran has accused the U.S. and other Western countries of meddling in its responses or with the comments that have come out about the demonstrations.\xc2\xa0 How do you refer to that, or how do you respond to that, because the President and the administration has been very clear that that\'s exactly what you don\'t want.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think the President has been crystal clear, Jeff, and consistent in laying out for the international community the concerns that we had surrounding the election and the universal principles with which we believe people can and should be able to stand up, to speak out, to have freedom of speech, to have the freedom to assemble and demonstrate without fear of harm.<br/> <br/>  That\'s been what he\'s consistently laid out, and I think if you look at the statements over the weekend I think the President continued to watch the situation evolve in Iran and speak out forcefully on behalf of justice and to warn the government against -- continue to warn the government against the use of violence.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on a separate foreign policy issue, the President referred to North Korea in his interview this weekend.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on that threat and how worried the people in Hawaii need to be about a potential long-range missile?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I can assure you and anybody listening, anybody in Hawaii, anybody in the United States, that the government is taking every precaution necessary to deal with threats throughout the world or threats that might be coming from the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- obviously the President\'s first task is to keep the American people safe, and I can assure you that steps have been and are being taken to make sure that\'s the case.<br/> <br/>  Look, in terms of the North Koreans, I\'m not sure that we\'re a whole lot different than we were in the past few days or past few weeks.\xc2\xa0 The North Koreans continue to make statements, bellicose statements, threatening different actions.\xc2\xa0 Many times what they threaten they eventually do.\xc2\xa0 That further alienates North Korea from the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think that has helped the world take unified action, strong steps to ensure that we\'re taking all necessary action to ensure that there isn\'t the ability for North Korea to export weapons or export material that would lead to proliferation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been our focus.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President said, when he was asked in the interview, that taking contingencies did not mean a military response necessarily.\xc2\xa0 So what -- how else can one understand that?\xc2\xa0 What else could "contingencies" mean?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President -- what the President referred to is taking all necessary steps to deal with whatever threat comes out of North Korea.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 I think I\'d refer you to what Secretary Gates said last week about moving different systems out into the Pacific in order to ensure the protection of the United States of America.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That very language was used when we went into Korea -- I mean, in Vietnam.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I was speaking more about the sort of the outer edge of the United States.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the face of poll numbers indicating that the American people have increasing concerns about some of the policies of the administration, and Democratic senators, such as Dianne Feinstein, saying that she doesn\'t think right now the votes are there in the Democratic caucus for a health care reform bill to pass, what does the President plan on doing to firm up more public support and more support among Democrats on Capitol Hill for his health care plan and for other plans?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will continue to speak every day about the issues that he believes are fundamental to us laying a foundation for continued economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Obviously throughout the week, the President is going to talk about the importance of cutting costs for families and small businesses as it relates to health care reform.<br/> <br/>  I think we\'ve seen progress over the past many weeks on getting comprehensive energy legislation -- take steps to get that through Congress to deal with lessening our dependence on foreign oil; ensuring that we\'re taking steps to change the way education is delivered; and obviously to take steps to improve our economy through both the Recovery Act, through financial regulation.\xc2\xa0 I think all four of those things is what encompasses the President\'s time and I think you\'ll see events throughout the week here at the White House on many of those topics.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel, does the White House feel that there needs to be more of a public campaign made that the American people need to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Juxtaposing this with the people saying we\'re overexposed?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I never said that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does there need to be more of a campaign outside the White House?\xc2\xa0 He brought back some campaign rhetoric today, I think, escaping the notice of nobody in this room, for the first time.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like he needs to go out there and storm the country?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think we need to storm the country.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will continue to use the opportunities that he has at the White House and on the road to talk about what he thinks will make America safer and stronger, ensuring that we get health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you step back and look at some of the significance of today\'s events -- you\'ve got the pharmaceutical industry and the largest group representing seniors in this country, who 16 years ago weren\'t at the table but were on the other side of the political debate.\xc2\xa0 I think that represents progress and important steps towards real reform.\xc2\xa0 I would say the same -- we\'ve made progress on comprehensive energy legislation.\xc2\xa0 And I think slowly but surely we\'re working to turn this economy around.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had a personal reaction to the images of violence that have come out of Iran this weekend?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he has -- I think throughout the course of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday I think he has been moved by what we\'ve seen on television.\xc2\xa0 I think particularly so by images of women in Iran who have stood up for their right to demonstrate, to speak out, and to be heard.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he seen the image of the young woman who\'s called Neda who was about to be killed by <br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\'s seen that particular image.\xc2\xa0 I know he\'s obviously watched some coverage of the events this week and has been struck by the passion.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow up on Jennifer\'s question on smoking, why haven\'t you probed the President on his smoking habits?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just hasn\'t crossed my mind.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it just seems to me like today it would have been a good explanation point at the end to say, you know, I had this habit and I kicked the habit --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if in fact that\'s what he\'s done.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that anybody that -- I\'m not a smoker, I don\'t -- it\'s probably just one vice I don\'t have.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has on any number of occasions discussed the struggle that -- the vice of smoking, what\'s that done to him and that he struggles with it every day.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t honestly see the need to get a whole lot more specific than the fact that it\'s a continuing struggle.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, last week the White House was trying to send a message that there\'s no pressure at all from what\'s going on, on Capitol Hill -- no external pressure to respond in a more forceful way.\xc2\xa0 But I noticed that statement over the weekend seemed to be a little tougher than the usual language from the White House.\xc2\xa0 Can you say that the White House feels no pressure at all to change its current policy in terms of how it\'s responding?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you, is he correct, though -- there is a perception out there that the President has ratcheted up -- you said earlier that his statements have been crystal clear and consistent, but there\'s a perception out there, I believe, among a lot of the pundits and others that -- I know, pundits, whoever -- that there\'s a perception out there that he has gradually ratcheted --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Far be it for me to conduct our foreign policy\xc2\xa0 based on pundits that we see on television --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And members of Congress.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- where\'s that gotten us?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, we\'re asking the questions here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the perception --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'m answering them fairly well today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glad you\'re so confident.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure, why not.\xc2\xa0 I\'m a pundit.\xc2\xa0 I\'m doing great.<br/> <br/>  No, but let me tell you, Chip --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s a perception out there -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let him finish the question.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I knew the answer almost before you asked it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\'m a pundit, I\'m grading myself pretty well today.<br/> <br/>  Chip, this isn\'t about -- I think you\'ve heard the President say this isn\'t about a foreign policy that makes us feel good; this isn\'t about statements that might make us feel good or sound good on television.\xc2\xa0 This is --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not asking that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking has he ratcheted up --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand, but this is --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- has he increased the pressure a little bit with his statement?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think obviously you\'ve seen events -- I think anybody would say events on the ground have changed over the course of the last week.\xc2\xa0 The President last Monday warned against the potential for violence -- and we\'ve seen that escalate throughout the week.<br/> <br/>  But, again, Chip, this is about ensuring -- as the President said, that he is speaking out for universal principles.\xc2\xa0 He said that last week.\xc2\xa0 But, Chip, there are many in Iran that would love us to be the story, as the President said and as I have said.\xc2\xa0 They would love to take this debate that\'s happening within Iran, by Iranians, about the direction of their leadership and the direction of their country -- and instead take that out and put us in.\xc2\xa0 The President has said he recognizes that, he understands that\'s not helpful and, I think quite honestly, Chip, many of the experts that -- many people in this room, their organizations have talked to, many Republicans have denoted that -- or have noted that the President has struck the right response here.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what\'s important.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other thing, if I could follow up on Jennifer\'s question.\xc2\xa0 You said she should call Ken Johnson, which of course she did and she did an excellent job of it -- here\'s a quote from it --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now who\'s grading who?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here\'s what Mr. Johnson said --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 She\'s going to let you do the first question more often.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- "There are a lot of discussions going on right now, there are a lot of moving pieces, there are a lot of elements to it that have not been finalized."\xc2\xa0 Why would they even do this if a lot of elements to this agreement have not been finalized?\xc2\xa0 Was it a slow day and they needed to fill a hole?\xc2\xa0 I mean, don\'t you usually wait until you\'ve got an agreement?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess if Jennifer didn\'t get the answer to that -- that question seems directed toward them, and I\'d encourage you to let them know.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know the answer to it, don\'t you?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that they\'re continuing to work on aspects of the agreement, an agreement they felt comfortable enough to talk about and an agreement that the largest seniors\' group felt comfortable enough endorsing<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has used the word "justice" -- it\'s been noted quite a bit -- when talking about Iran.\xc2\xa0 When -- right now the administration doesn\'t feel like the protestors are receiving justice.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the protestors -- so he has used the word "justice," and it\'s a -- apparently it\'s a -- in this case words matter, it\'s a specific choice of words that you --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not just words.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not just words, apparently.\xc2\xa0 If you could say -- so the President -- does the President believe justice has not been served yet in Iran, correct?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I think if you watch the images that are on television screens and are written about and the principles that the President laid out, I think that\'s clear that justice has not been achieved, absolutely.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if justice is not achieved, does the administration believe that this regime needs to be held accountable in some way?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is precisely the argument that I\'m making.\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re being held accountable.\xc2\xa0 In many ways you\'re seeing that accountability on the street each and every day in Tehran.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about the relationship with the rest of the world?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you asked anybody, including this government, you would say -- they would agree that Iran -- their image has suffered greatly in the images that we see on television.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that that\'s anything that would ultimately come as a surprise to anyone.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is this going to mean down the road?\xc2\xa0 Is this about sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Is this about --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the ability to sit down and be treated as somebody worth negotiating with?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ve -- obviously, again, the President has talked about the principles and obviously those principles are being violated.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- it\'s hard for me to get into what\'s going to go down the road based on what ultimately happens here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as I\'ve noted, our long-term security interests as it relates to the support of terrorism and their pursuit of a nuclear weapon haven\'t changed.\xc2\xa0 But our focus right now is not on that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court made a ruling on the Voting Rights Act.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a comment about the fact that the Court expressed serious concerns about the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get into -- I have not gotten a specific reaction from the President or from Counsel on their interpretation of the ruling yet.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, when will you have that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When they have to chance to interpret that ruling.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a particular issue or issues that helped the President decide to have a press conference tomorrow?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The yearning to speak with you all on a intimate basis on a -- (laughter) --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give us a hint of what his opening message will be?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And in many of your cases, to boost sunscreen sales.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  I think the President will use the occasion, again, to discuss the progress that he believes the country needs to make on laying that foundation for long-term growth.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear him talk about the cost, the skyrocketing cost of health care; use examples of why it\'s important, as you\'ve seen him do on events on the road; I think the President will talk about progress that we\'ve made and is being made on energy independence, legislation going through Congress; and I anticipate he\'ll also have comments on what we\'re seeing in Iran.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more thing.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday on CNN, Dianne Feinstein suggested that an expansion of Medicaid that is in basically all the health care bills on Capitol Hill would break her state and that she doubted that the President had the votes right now.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, is there any give to be had on the idea of covering some or a large proportion of the 44 million uninsured by expanding Medicaid?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I mean, I think as it relates to California, one thing to bear in mind is that the Recovery Act has provided over $3 billion in increased Medicaid payments to -- just to the state of California as they have struggled with their budget.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- it\'s not up to me to sort of negotiate one way or the other on that aspect of the bill right here.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is it the President\'s belief that the results of the election in Iran are fraudulent?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he continues, as the administration does, to have concerns and questions, as many in the international community do, about how that election was conducted.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration want a do-over of the election?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Mark, this is something -- as the President said, we did not have on the ground international observers.\xc2\xa0 This is something that is playing out right now in the streets of Iran.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on tobacco, he said there\'s more to be done on the issue.\xc2\xa0 What does he have in mind?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think continuing -- I mean, obviously we have -- obviously, each and every day -- look, I -- let me start this way.\xc2\xa0 I think, obviously, this is landmark legislation that is more than a decade in the making that takes some serious action on marketing, on trying to keep thousands and thousands of children every day from starting a habit that will greatly impact their health on the out-years.\xc2\xa0 And I think obviously continuing to make progress -- obviously, the pitch for prevention and wellness are a big part of health care reform, because many of those long-term costs the government and taxpayers end up paying on the back end.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there is more progress on those issues to be made.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he does not advocate a ban?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the Medicare agreement, can you spell out exactly how much of that $80 billion is going to go toward the "doughnut hole" versus how much is going to go to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have those figures.\xc2\xa0 I can see if we have any more information on that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this week with the President\'s press conference tomorrow, with a health care event Wednesday night, is the President trying to get more control of the debate?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think obviously this is a big priority for the President, and I think it\'s something that he\'ll continue to work and talk about in laying this -- as I\'ve said repeatedly today, laying the foundation for long-term economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President believes these are extremely important issues.\xc2\xa0 And the opportunity to talk to you all and talk to the American people about them is important.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the setbacks last week, is he trying to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean -- I think the town hall meeting you all knew about last week, and, in all honesty, the press conference has been our block schedule for several weeks.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what was unjust about the Iranian regime\'s actions that the President felt it necessary to note on Saturday?\xc2\xa0 What specifically led him to use -- what is unjust about what has been happening?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you have seen obviously over the course of many days and you saw this on -- you\'ve seen violence ratchet up appreciably and you\'ve also seen I think pretty red-line statements Friday, Saturday, even some today, about what actions would be taken against those that the President believes are fulfilling their universal principles.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was the increasing violence and the threat of more that was viewed -- so it\'s not just an order of magnitude that led the White House to say "unjust"?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 An order of magnitude?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of the violence.\xc2\xa0 Because obviously there have been those who have died in the streets before the President on Saturday used the word "unjust."<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, and -- which is why the President, again, a week ago -- a week ago, remember, we were a day or so away from, maybe two days away from the election, the President was asked and responded to images on television that warned against increased violence.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we saw that ratchet up throughout the course of the last several days.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week when I asked you -- I think it was maybe Tuesday or Wednesday -- if this administration was still open to negotiation with the ruling regime in Iran, you said, yes.\xc2\xa0 Today, a moment ago when a very similar question was asked, you said, well, it\'s hard to say what\'s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Are you less certain about whether it is fruitful for this administration to consider negotiating with the regime now?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not less certain about whether it\'s fruitful because I understand the fruit that was not borne or beared as a result of not engaging the Islamic Republic of Iran, right?\xc2\xa0 We\'ve gone from zero spinning centrifuges to several thousand.\xc2\xa0 I think --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was true a week ago.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is, has what\'s happened and the injustice that this administration has taken note of changed its attitude about whether it would be worthwhile to pursue negotiations with a regime that is now, in its opinion and in the opinion of others in the world, less just than it was a week ago?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I\'ve said and I said earlier today, our interest as it relates to our grave concern about the help that\'s provided to terrorists, the grave concern that we have about the pursuit of a nuclear weapon remain unchanged.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I would point you to what Senator Lugar said yesterday in discussing the fact that -- the desirability of still continuing those discussions.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much will the government save with this arrangement that was announced here at the White House today?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that figure with me.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Zero is the figure, actually.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m curious why --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\'t think that\'s the case.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that is the case, because in the "doughnut hole" there\'s no coverage, and so that\'s a benefit for the seniors.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- but, again, let me --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At least that\'s how it\'s been explained to me.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I think as I said -- you\'ve noted what I said earlier on different subjects -- as I said earlier, some portion of this is going to go to the pharmaceutical industry making good on the savings proposals that the President has outlined to make health care more efficient, which will impact the amount that the government pays.\xc2\xa0 The President I think outlined almost $100 billion in savings through efficiency that he would like to see as a result of the pharmaceutical industry.\xc2\xa0 So I guess it\'s somewhere between zero and, say, a hundred billion dollars.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not a direct government cost, though.\xc2\xa0 That may be an efficiency within a private sector, but it\'s not a government cost.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 The President can\'t lay on the table savings to pay for health care that the government doesn\'t pay.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the whole definition of CBO scorability that makes our proposal --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We had a $2 trillion event here at the White House which isn\'t CBO scorable --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but this isn\'t part of $2 trillion; this is part of the $948 billion that the President laid on the table as part of a down payment on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- the fact that this is zero money for the government is simply just not true.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t know how much, though?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an exact number with me.<br/> <br/>  Jeff.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran specifically, is he looking at -- is the President looking at any videos, or is he going online himself to find out what\'s going on?\xc2\xa0 Or how specifically is he following this outside of his meetings with advisors that we were briefed on over the weekend?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how is he following the developments there?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if he\'s looking on different Web sites or external information via the Internet that he is getting.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as you mentioned, he met with advisors both Saturday and Sunday on the topic of Iran.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know what external information via the Internet or what sites he\'s on, on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could ask one more thing on smoking.\xc2\xa0 During the campaign, the President -- then-senator at the time -- and Mrs. Obama went on "60 Minutes" and used his smoking as part of his biography, as part of his sort of campaign narrative, if you will.\xc2\xa0 He has used his biography in many ways.\xc2\xa0 Why not use this as an opportunity, if he has or if he hasn\'t quit smoking, to discuss this with the American people or even offer a warning to young children about smoking?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think he was fairly forward today in discussing the fact that this is, as I\'ve said throughout the last couple of weeks, something that he continues to struggle with.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, he used about eight words in his speech, though, as opposed to saying something that --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the appropriate word count would have been in order to check the box.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the President spoke about this in personal terms, regardless of the word count.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it something that still aggravates him, when he\'s asked about this?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I should give you that opportunity to ask tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did ask him, and he turned away -- walked away.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, go figure.<br/> <br/>  Helen.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times\' poll says that support for single-payer goes through the roof, and why has the President totally ignored it then?\xc2\xa0 Eighty percent.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that number.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has discussed ensuring that there is a public option to increased choice and competition in health care as we seek to reduce costs for families and small businesses.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he doesn\'t go for single-payer?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/> <br/>  Margaret.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The President said today that "as part of the health care reform I expect Congress to enact this year" -- and then talked about the agreement that he was hailing today --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say that --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In discussing the $80 billion agreement that he was praising today, he talked about it in a context of the broader Medicare -- the broader health care reform he\'s thinking of\xc2\xa0 passing.\xc2\xa0 Is this in any way hooked to the passage of X, Y, Z, or does -- will this agreement stand alone even if everything else blows up?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think PhRMA is better to answer that, but obviously to get broad-based savings in health care we\'re going to need comprehensive health care reform.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do you have any more guidance on Wednesday for us in terms of --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The town hall, the health care thing, the Wednesday thing.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Guidance in terms of?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How it will work.\xc2\xa0 Other than ABC, is it just going to be pooled or --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, without having worked this out totally, my sense is that we\'ll have a print pooler or two embargoed until the program airs.\xc2\xa0 I think the video will come via ABC.<br/> <br/>  Savannah.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d just like to follow up on cigarettes.\xc2\xa0 When you say he still struggles, does that mean he still smokes sometimes?\xc2\xa0 Is that what that means?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to parse the President\'s words on this today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those were not how he describes it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How did he say it today?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said, in the past, he had been one of the teenagers who had been -- or the current -- I just wanted to understand the --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I said last week -- I\'d have to go back and look at my exact statement -- but I got from him that obviously this is a struggle that he continues to have.<br/> <br/>  Josh.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the issue of the DOMA brief, one of your colleagues over the weekend, Lisa Brown, said that she didn\'t think some of the language that was in that brief should have been in there.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify from last week whether that brief was clear here at the White House, whether it represents the White House\'s view?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lisa is the Staff Secretary.\xc2\xa0 You didn\'t ask her?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t a press conference; it was a panel discussion.\xc2\xa0 But can you clarify whether it was cleared --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know if there is any discussion underway about maybe modifying it or changing it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/> <br/>  George.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you see as a realistic timetable for getting immigration reform through Congress?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as I talked about last week, the President is going to have a meeting at the White House on Thursday with those that have supported and opposed in the past what the President believes is comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- I think as I described it last week -- part of the ongoing and continued conversation, understanding that we\'ve still got progress to make in order to get something like this through the House and the Senate.<br/> <br/>  I think the President hopes that later this year we can have and begin formal debate on that.\xc2\xa0 And I think he hopes that it will happen soon, but doesn\'t have a crystal ball as to when that might happen.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With everything else that\'s going on you can see it slipping into next year?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can see the President\'s desire for it to happen, but understanding that the current --currently where we sit, the math makes that more difficult than the discussion.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there\'s a report by ESPN that\'s getting widespread pickup.\xc2\xa0 This is a year out, but I have to ask the question nonetheless -- the President\'s plan on going to South Africa for the opening of the World Cup.\xc2\xa0 Is this travel in the planning?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, though you wouldn\'t know it from my physique, as a former college soccer player, I asked the scheduling office about this, as well.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What\'s so funny?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What position?\xc2\xa0 Midfield?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Goalkeeper.\xc2\xa0 Go figure, right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now it makes sense.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sort of look, and I see it all -- I asked specifically that, as well, in order to get my seat early.\xc2\xa0 I\'m told from scheduling that the President has accepted a meeting with the head of FIFA World Cup, but we have not yet altogether made plans -- though I can assure you that a small group of us have assembled in order to move the President in that direction.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tickets --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got four right up close.<br/> <br/>  Sorry, go ahead.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on health care.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday former Labor Secretary Robert Reich said he was worried that the Obama White House had over-learned the lessons of the Clinton years -- deferring too much to Congress when it came to crafting legislation.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that critique, which I should add George Stephanopoulos seemed to agree with?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to weigh into network politics on this.\xc2\xa0 And I quite honestly don\'t want to -- don\'t think there\'s a whole lot of utility in me getting involved in a debate about tactically whether the pursuit of what we\'re doing versus how or when it was pursued 16 years ago is appropriate, except to say, as I said earlier, the President envisioned, as he said throughout the campaign, a big table of negotiations in order to get long-term, comprehensive health care reform that cuts costs.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was their reform too messy?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see, based on the notion that the pharmaceutical industry who, again, was on the other side of the political debate, not even at the table 16 years ago -- I think if where AARP was 16 years ago -- I think regardless of what we have or haven\'t learned, I think the process that the President is moving forward with negotiations with all those stakeholders involved is making progress toward long term reform.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what\'s important.<br/> <br/>  But, Sam, as I said, there\'s been a point throughout each of the five months where the pundits, as Chip talked about, like to talk about how everything is amiss, off the rails, and dead on arrival.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But these are people involved in the Clinton effort -- not just pundits.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, but not necessarily working each and every day on what we\'re doing to move that reform forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to get into a debate with Secretary Rice, but, again, I don\'t -- I think the announcement today of AARP thinking this is a step toward meaningful reform and supporting that is in itself different than what we had 16 years ago.<br/> <br/>  David.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Senator Feinstein said that she -- or indicated she wasn\'t satisfied with the intelligence on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been getting good intelligence?\xc2\xa0 Is he satisfied with the intelligence output on Iran?\xc2\xa0 And is he learning things from the intelligence that are --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to comment on the intelligence process or the specific intelligence that the President is getting.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not even whether he\'s satisfied with what he\'s getting?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just let me follow up on the Friday question.\xc2\xa0 I asked you if he was consulting with anybody outside the government.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on that today.\xc2\xa0 I meant to do that on Friday and I apologize.<br/> <br/>  April.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on Iran.\xc2\xa0 What is --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Back on what?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay, I\'m sorry, I didn\'t hear you.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the best-case scenario after watching the activities this week for the levels of engagement that you had hoped for prior to the elections?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the best case scenario?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In terms of whether they happen, the outcome, what --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right -- to keep the levels of engagement the way you had anticipated prior to this election, what\'s the best-case scenario for this administration?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, obviously there are events that are happening, as we\'ve discussed, on the ground right now that are the focus of the administration\'s effort.\xc2\xa0 But again, our long-term interests and our long-term goals haven\'t changed.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not -- whether or not the Iranians will accept all of their responsibilities is something that can only be measured when that starts to happen.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we understand it\'s about levels of engagement after what happens this week.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, again, I understand this administration wanted to have open lines with top officials, but what is the best-case scenario to keep that happening?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 The P5-plus-1 has a request in to speak directly with the Iranians, and that\'s not a request that\'s changed or been withdrawn.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the situation on the meeting for Afghanistan later this month?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is this the regional Afghanistan meeting?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe so.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I thought that had taken place, but I will --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand they didn\'t name who they wanted to come as of yet.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, beyond the explanation about not wanting to appear to be meddling, it\'s been suggested that the United States actually has the power -- very quietly, without giving that appearance -- to transmit via satellite a broadband access into Iran and help people continue to communicate.\xc2\xa0 Any talks about anything like that going on that you\'re --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But I want to make sure that I\'m understanding --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a column in the Post over the weekend, I think David Ignatius talked about how the United States has the technical ability to transmit via satellite broadband capability into Iran to help Iranians on the ground communicate with each other.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go back and check on a technical measure whether that\'s -- what that means.\xc2\xa0 This is a little out of my technical --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve never heard of that discussion or issue then?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, but I\'ll go and see if there\'s others that have -- that are in more of the day-to-day meetings that might have a greater sense of the technical capabilities of that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It may seem like a long way off at this moment, but in two weeks the President will be going to Russia, Italy, and to Ghana.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wednesday seems like a long way off.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I bet.\xc2\xa0 What message does the President hope to deliver to the people of Africa, the African nations?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we obviously have reminders, even as we speak, of the importance of free and fair elections; the importance of determining your leaders.\xc2\xa0 And I think obviously Ghana is a shining example on the continent for that.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there are a number of investments that our government has made in the continent, both in the previous administration -- I think the President has rightly given a lot of credit for the PEPFAR initiative to President Bush, whether it\'s the communicable diseases of malaria or diseases like HIV/AIDS that the -- that each administration has given great commitments to.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously that, and I think just the overall development message I think will be important for this administration to continue to pursue, and I think you\'ll see that.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, job losses are outstripping the jobs being created by the stimulus, and we expect to see unemployment at 10 percent or higher in 2010.\xc2\xa0 But --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has said this, and I would certainly say this -- I think you\'re likely to see unemployment at 10 percent within the next couple of months.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but when you talk about growing the economy, your answer seems to be health care reform, which --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think that -- go ahead, finish your question before I --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- which is going to take a long time to complete.\xc2\xa0 Absent health care reform, do you have a plan B or a second stimulus?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me sort of separate the two questions, because I think what I\'ve talked about in terms of laying the long-term foundation for economic growth -- obviously, it includes health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I think decisions that small businesses are making and large businesses are making each day about the premiums and their ability to pay for or not pay for their employees\' health care is a very short-term problem, as well as something the President wants to seek a long-term answer to.<br/> <br/>  But the President, whether it\'s renewed commitment to education, whether it\'s clean energy jobs that will put people to work in high-wage jobs, help our dependence on foreign oil; make our country safer; make our environment cleaner; obviously, again, the commitment to education and ensuring a work force that\'s ready and able to take on the jobs of the future; innovation; a renewed focus on things like data and manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 There are I think any number of things that the administration is working on.<br/> <br/>  I do think -- there were stories about this today -- you are going to see the jobless rate increase for a while.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has said that; I\'ve said that on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 I think the figure that was in the paper today, which is accurate, is you have to create about 125,000 to 150,000 jobs a month simply to see the number, whatever level it\'s at, remain the same.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  We\'ve seen some positive changes in some of the inflections in the amount of joblessness each month.\xc2\xa0 But, again, that\'s a long way to go to both creating jobs on the positive side and then creating jobs on the positive side enough to either keep the rate steady or bring that rate down.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is going to take quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a big focus of this administration and for this President.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On unemployment?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In California, unemployment now has reached to 11.5.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the highest jobless rate since World War II.\xc2\xa0 This is the high-held -- the national average -- higher than the national average of 9.4 percent -- more than the states of Michigan at 14 percent, Oregon at 12.4 percent, and Rhode Island at 12.1 percent.<br/> <br/>  Now, I heard what you just said, and the question he just asked is related to this.\xc2\xa0 But what else can the President do for the people now that the stimulus package and all of the things that you just said that you\'re doing, what else can be done for the people who have lost their jobs right now?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s not -- I appreciate that you\'ve accepted my answer on the Recovery Act, but let\'s not paper over what\'s involved in the Recovery Act that addresses the needs of states and localities.\xc2\xa0 Again, California, as I said earlier, has gotten over $3 billion in increased Medicaid funds; nearly $4 billion in additional education funds.\xc2\xa0 Many of the states that you mentioned have also gotten money.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve extended unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 We have extended health care for those that are losing their jobs.<br/> <br/>  There\'s no doubt -- I think there\'s 14 or 15 of the states, some of which you mentioned, that exceed the 9.4 percent national average after BLS introduced their state-by-state statistics on Friday -- there\'s no doubt that many states are hurting budgetarily; many have seen industries close up shop.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what the President believed and why the President believed we needed a strong recovery and reinvestment plan to begin to change the curve in many of those states.<br/> <br/>  Obviously we\'ve discussed -- Michigan I think leads the country in unemployment.\xc2\xa0 Obviously their situation in some ways is a little bit more unique based on the dependence on auto manufacturing, on auto parts supply, that the President has taken steps to address.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no doubt that the recovery plan is making important investments in both state budgets and in individual aspects of recovery, whether it\'s trying to use tax incentives to create clean energy jobs or create jobs through increased and quicker investment in transportation projects that have a two-fold effect:\xc2\xa0 One, you\'re putting people back to work immediately; and two -- and I think Governor Schwarzenegger has talked about this fairly extensively -- and that is the infrastructure needs that his state has in the near term in order to lay that foundation for long-term economic growth.<br/> <br/>  The recovery plan is, in its investment in infrastructure funding, doing both of those things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President understands that we\'ve got a long way to go to turning this economy around and that\'s what his focus is.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  3:36 P.M.</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
