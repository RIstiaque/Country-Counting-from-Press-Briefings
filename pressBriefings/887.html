EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go right to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tKen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out his plan today on taxes.\xc2\xa0 Republicans in Congress have said that they want to temporarily extend the Bush tax cuts across the board for all income groups.\xc2\xa0 If that bill were to reach the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, would he veto it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things, Ken.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of disagreement in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The President talks about it all the time -- the fact that we have a stalemate that has prevented us from doing some of the very important things we need to do to help grow the economy, to help it create more jobs, and to help make the middle class more secure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing that we all agree on -- virtually everyone in Washington, Democrats and Republicans -- is that the middle-class tax cuts should be extended.\xc2\xa0 We all agree.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good for American families.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the American economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President announced today -- his absolute intention and willingness to sign a bill that would extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Republicans want to hold those tax cuts hostage to the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, including millionaires and billionaires, that seems pretty untenable.\xc2\xa0 That seems like a hard argument to make.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear:\xc2\xa0 We should extend the tax cuts for the middle class, for 98 percent of Americans.\xc2\xa0 We should not extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans -- tax cuts for people who don\xe2\x80\x99t need them and for whom it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even make a great deal of -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make economic sense to extend them.\xc2\xa0 As any economist whose PhD is worth the paper it is printed on will tell you, middle-class Americans -- hardworking, middle-class Americans, when they get that tax cut, it has a very positive and direct and immediate impact on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Wealthier Americans tend not to spend that.\xc2\xa0 And the cost, in terms of adding to our deficit, makes it a net loss.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President would sign tomorrow a bill that everybody agrees on -- extend the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 He does not support extending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he would veto a bill that extends the tax cuts across the board then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He would not support it.\xc2\xa0 He would not sign that bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the weekend, several Democrats, including Robert Gibbs, were critical of Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s offshore bank accounts.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that holding an offshore bank account would disqualify someone from being President?\xc2\xa0 And why is this relevant to the campaign?\xc2\xa0 How does this tell us how the next administration will help address the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you should take purely campaign related questions and address them to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that the President believes that disclosure is an important tradition, and a useful one, in this country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that he\xe2\x80\x99s followed as a candidate for office, both when he ran for the Senate and, obviously, when he ran for President in 2008, and again now running for reelection.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I think you should take that question to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there something nefarious about a presidential candidate having an offshore account?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a question you may address to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I think the issue here is most of these questions could be answered easily by any candidate who would simply disclose tax returns, as the President did, as virtually every major presidential candidate in recent memory has.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlister.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The Bush-era tax cuts expiring at the end of the year are part of the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House open to exploring a deal that would tie together a postponement of the sequesters coming in as a way of pushing off the -- sort of the impact of all of those things happening at the same time on the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, in terms of creating some greater economic certainty, the initiative the President announced today, which is his absolute willingness and intention to sign a bill that would extend for a year the tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, that would relieve -- that would create certainty for the vast majority of Americans, and it would have a very positive impact economically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur position, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on the broader issues when you talk about the sequester -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an action-enforcing mechanism.\xc2\xa0 And we all know what needs to be done to address our medium- and long-term fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very clear at length in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal what his position is on how we need to move forward to address these issues, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a balanced approach that includes non-defense discretionary spending cuts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 It includes reforms to entitlement programs to make them stronger and more cost effective.\xc2\xa0 And it includes asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share so that we do not ask ordinary, hardworking Americans and seniors and parents of disabled children to be the ones to bear the full burden of getting our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but that\xe2\x80\x99s his position.\xc2\xa0 But would he rule out doing a deal if it tied the two things together to get an extension, given you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get it done in this Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to negotiate something that will be decided much later in the year, today.\xc2\xa0 I think what we made clear today, what the President made clear today is there are a lot of issues where we have a great deal of disagreement.\xc2\xa0 There is a stalemate in Washington that is due almost entirely to the fact that Republicans are so intransigent when it comes to asking that everyone pay their fair share and do their fair share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut one thing we all agree on, Democrats and Republicans alike, is that America\xe2\x80\x99s middle class should have this tax cut extended, that their taxes should not go up on average $2,200 in six months.\xc2\xa0 Since we all agree on that, pass the bill in the Senate, pass it in the House, send it to the White House, the President will sign it.\xc2\xa0 And that will have a positive effect on those American families and on the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is the President wedded to that $250,000 threshold?\xc2\xa0 And does today represent a change?\xc2\xa0 Before, he said $200,000 for individuals; $250,000 income for households.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still talking about households here.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position has been this very same position for a long, long time, and it has not changed and it will not change.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we should extend tax cuts for 98 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 And we can do that -- he, as you know, is in favor of extending those tax cuts and making them permanent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, recognizing that there is a stalemate in Washington and that the broader issues of tax reform are very much a subject of contentious debate, let\xe2\x80\x99s do something that can have a positive effect on the economy and have a positive effect on the finances of millions and millions and millions of American families, and pass this and sign it into law right away.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of his Democratic colleagues have made the case for putting that threshold at a million dollars -- a way of letting the taxes go up only for those in a much, much higher category.\xc2\xa0 Would he negotiate anything like that?\xc2\xa0 Does he -- would he reject that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear; he announced it today.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is something we all agree on, and we should be able to have Congress pass.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, has said that he looks forward to giving Democrats and Republicans in the Senate the opportunity to vote on this proposal that he supports, in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 The President very much appreciates that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, here is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position long held, encapsulated in this specific legislative proposal that everybody agrees on.\xc2\xa0 And I guess the question is, if Senate Republicans oppose this, if Republicans, beyond the Senate, oppose this, they have to explain why, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- you were here, Ann, and so was I, and we saw what happened.\xc2\xa0 The tax cuts that were passed in the early part of this century, in 2001 and I think 2003, that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans, they were -- we were assured at the time that the reason why they were so -- the right thing to do was because it would create prosperity for everyone -- that the middle class would benefit, that average Americans would end up benefiting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we saw instead was an economy that created fewer jobs than during any period of expansion in recent memory.\xc2\xa0 We saw the incomes of the wealthiest Americans expand considerably while middle-class incomes stagnated or declined.\xc2\xa0 And then the end point of this experiment was the calamitous recession that was the worst economic recession, the worst crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- economic crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had since the 1930s.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we tried that -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out so well.\xc2\xa0 A good point of comparison in terms of tax rates for wealthiest Americans is the period before that, under President Bill Clinton, which you also covered.\xc2\xa0 And when those tax rates were put into place, I remember in 1993 some Republicans said it would cause a terrible recession and economic decline.\xc2\xa0 And instead, we saw the largest peacetime expansion in our history.\xc2\xa0 We saw an economy that created over 23 million jobs, I believe.\xc2\xa0 And we saw the first budget surpluses in a generation or more.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at what these proposals are and comparing them, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to guess about what the impact would be if they were implemented -- if the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals were implemented versus proposals put forward by Republicans both in Congress and on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the impacts of those policy proposals in the past.\xc2\xa0 And I think most people accept the premise that the statistics bear out, which is that the middle class did not do so well in a situation where tax cuts were given to, disproportionately, to the wealthiest Americans, and our budget deficits exploded and we ended up in a terrible recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where do you get the 97 percent figure for small businesses that would be under the $250,000?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Where do I get it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we can provide you the sources for this.*</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But this is a -- I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked me about this, Ann.\xc2\xa0 The question is -- as almost -- on a save/get key, when this issue is raised about the need to end these tax cuts for the wealthiest earners in America, because we can\'t afford them, opponents of that policy come out and say, well, you\'re raising taxes on America\'s job creators, on small businesses.\xc2\xa0 But it is a fact that 97 percent of America\'s small businesses would not be affected by this.\xc2\xa0 It is a fact that of the 400 wealthiest Americans, roughly half of them would qualify as a small business under the definition put forward by Senator McConnell and others.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\'s a useful exercise to ask those who hold up the banner of being defenders of small business on this issue to say, well, where are these small businesses and who are they who would be harmed by this?\xc2\xa0 And the fact is they\'re often partners in law firms or hedge fund managers.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not the kind of small businesses that you and I tend to think of when we talk about small businesses.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not the small businesses who have been helped again and again by this President, who has signed into law I believe 18 or 19 small business tax cuts and who has on his "To-Do" list for Congress another tax cut for small businesses that would go to small businesses that hire or raise their wages.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf members -- if Republicans in Congress are concerned about small businesses, they have an opportunity this week to vote for that proposal.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to them doing so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMove it around a little bit -- foreign policy, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Perhaps -- maybe you want to ask about the tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan -- I\'m sure you and everyone here has seen the video of the, quote, execution of the woman in the Taliban village.\xc2\xa0 General Allen had a statement, and I wanted to give you an opportunity to say something from the podium about that.\xc2\xa0 And I had another question on that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, General Allen, President Karzai, the U.S. Embassy have all spoken out to condemn the Taliban\'s public execution of an Afghan woman in the Parwan Province.\xc2\xa0 From here, I would echo that strong condemnation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the Taliban\'s rule, women\'s rights were ignored, attacked and eroded.\xc2\xa0 This cold-blooded murder is another reminder to the Afghan people and the international community of the brutality of the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 The United States stands alongside the Afghan people, and especially the women of Afghanistan, to ensure that the hard-won gains made by women in the last 10 years in that country are not only protected, but advanced.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you how this links over to the whole issue of talks with the Taliban and the kinds of things that this White House considers in this process of negotiations and, in fact, where those talks stand at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two points.\xc2\xa0 One, we support an Afghan-led process of reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 There cannot be peace in that country without reconciliation, ultimate peace.\xc2\xa0 The criteria that we have made clear must be present for any reconciliation process, for any Taliban who would reconcile, is that they would abide by the Afghan constitution, they would lay down arms, and they would renounce any ties to al Qaeda and to the tactics of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are the criteria that we put in place.\xc2\xa0 But reconciliation, I think everyone recognizes is something that has to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And we support an Afghan-led process of reconciliation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President see that video?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t discussed it with him.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Norah and then Brianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this effort -- the White House talking about extending these tax cuts for those under $250,000 -- a way to distract from the poor job numbers last Friday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a way to focus on something that we all agree on, which is that these tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpaying Americans should be extended, and coming together around that rare consensus, voting yes to it, and having the President sign it into law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHow could it be a reaction to something that happened a few days ago when it\xe2\x80\x99s been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position all along that these tax cuts should be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on that very point --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- extended for middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that very point that it\xe2\x80\x99s been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position all along, in December 2010, when he advocated an extension of all of the Bush tax cuts, including those for the wealthiest of Americans, he argued that raising taxes would be a \xe2\x80\x9cblow to our economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s different from now from then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position has always been that we should permanently extend the tax cuts for middle-class Americans and we should no longer extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 At the time that you question, there was a package of proposals that passed that helped the economy at a time that it was very vulnerable and that the President signed into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat he made clear at the time was that he would not in the future support a measure that would extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it was a point made by independent economists and others at the time, and they\xe2\x80\x99re making it again now, that when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about positive effects on the economy, it is tax cuts to middle-class Americans that produce that positive effect.\xc2\xa0 It is not tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans who tend not to spend that money as quickly or as readily as hardworking, middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the cost of extending those tax cuts -- $65 billion -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about for the high end -- $65 billion for one year, close to a trillion over 10 -- is prohibitive, and we cannot afford it, and it does not work as a matter of macroeconomic policy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what happened in the period from 2001 to 2008.\xc2\xa0 We saw the impact of those policy decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also in December, the President said that raising taxes on entrepreneurs who have money said that -- he said then, when entrepreneurs have money, it frees up \xe2\x80\x9cother money to hire workers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So why was the argument then that raising taxes on entrepreneurs would be bad and now it\xe2\x80\x99s okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about apples and oranges.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve just made clear, the small business --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he said in December 2010 it would be a blow to the economy to raise taxes on individuals.\xc2\xa0 Now he says it\xe2\x80\x99s not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, as I just said, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking 98 percent of the tax cuts -- 98 percent -- for 98 percent of the American people, he has always supported extending.\xc2\xa0 He supported it then.\xc2\xa0 He supported it now.\xc2\xa0 He --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in December 2010, he was worried about entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not now worried about entrepreneurs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course he is, which is why he has passed small business tax cuts and signed into law small business tax cuts for I think 17 or 18 or 19 times.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why he has put forward a proposal that Republicans could join Democrats in supporting this very week that would extend another tax break to small businesses if they hire -- make new hires or expand the wages of their employees.\xc2\xa0 The President is very concerned about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99re buying into, again, the red herring argument that just isn\xe2\x80\x99t true because -- and they can\xe2\x80\x99t back it up -- that somehow the top 2 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s earners are all a bunch of small businesses when, in fact, the people who would be affected by this are -- that would identify themselves as small businesses under that definition, are largely hedge fund managers and law firm partners and others who file that way who tend to be doing much better than average, hardworking, middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Joint Committee on Taxation and Republicans have pointed out that about a million businesses would be affected by this, who file as Subchapter S corporations.\xc2\xa0 And so --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can repeat it, and I will, that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 97 percent of small businesses -- 97 percent would not be affected.\xc2\xa0 The small businesses --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is that figure from?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in front of me.\xc2\xa0 But this is not a disputed notion.\xc2\xa0 I understand that -- I mean, there was a great piece done not long ago when this was a debate about -- *</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is a disputed notion.\xc2\xa0 Republicans say something different.\xc2\xa0 It is disputed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you ought to ask them:\xc2\xa0 Would hedge fund managers who file that way, who make millions and millions of dollars potentially, benefit from this?\xc2\xa0 And are they one of the small businesses that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to support?\xc2\xa0 Would law firm partners who are doing very well but who file as a small business because they\xe2\x80\x99re in a partnership, are they the small businesses that they\xe2\x80\x99re so desperate to protect?\xc2\xa0 If they want to protect and assist small businesses, they ought to vote for the tax cut the President has put on the table and that will be voted on in the Senate this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tI understand that this makes them uncomfortable, because one of the reasons we have a stalemate in Washington is because of their absolute intransigence, their refusal to even entertain the idea that the wealthiest Americans ought to do their fair share.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the comprehensive, balanced budget proposal that every independent commission that\xe2\x80\x99s looked at it, made up of Republicans and Democrats, that everybody who takes these issues seriously has said we need to have, that the President himself has put forward in numerous proposals to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Because -- it\xe2\x80\x99s because when the would-be Presidents in the Republican primary process were asked if they would support a proposal that had $1 in revenue increases for every $10 in spending cuts to a person, they said no.\xc2\xa0 And that is so far outside of the mainstream in terms of what makes -- what the American people support and what is common-sense economic policy that it has created this stalemate.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut one thing we can agree on is that middle-class Americans, 98 percent of taxpayers in this country, should have their tax cuts extended.\xc2\xa0 We cannot afford to extend them for the wealthiest taxpayers in America.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work as economic policy, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe tax rates that seem to concern those who are asking the question that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking of me were in place at a time of record economic growth; at a time when the middle class did well and millionaires and billionaires did well; when mom-and-pop shops did well and large corporations did well; when folks on Main Street did well and people on Wall Street did well.\xc2\xa0 By contrast, when we put into place the Bush tax cuts, look what happened:\xc2\xa0 The middle class saw their incomes stagnate, and by the end of that eight-year period, we had the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I think I did say -- Brianna, then Chuck, then Alexis.\xc2\xa0 Yes -- and sorry, Wendell, you too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 To follow on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s question about timing -- a Democratic source tells CNN that this announcement that the President made was actually moved up, which would give the appearance that it was to distract from the jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 Was it moved up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position for a long time.\xc2\xa0 He believes that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the position, the sort of spectacle today of going before the cameras and saying something.\xc2\xa0 I mean, not -- obviously, this is his position, but going --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Having the President of the United States go forward and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This announcement, the actual -- what he said today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: -- say what his position is and what he believes Congress ought to do has been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I have said it in my briefings and gaggles, that if the Congress were to pass a bill extending the middle-class tax cuts either temporarily or permanently tomorrow, the President would sign it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, the President in his announcement today is acknowledging what he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about out in the country, which is the stalemate has been making it very hard to get the necessary big things done that we need to get done, so we ought to focus on something that we all agree on, which is that we should extend tax cuts for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, that the event was moved up in time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it was scheduled for any other day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And would he veto an extension that had a million-dollar threshold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position, as he articulated today, and as he has made clear for many years now, is that tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans should be extended.\xc2\xa0 Those for the remaining 2 percent -- the wealthiest Americans, including millionaires and billionaires -- should not, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make good economic policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in 2010 he agreed to let --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I addressed this.\xc2\xa0 I understand --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and you said that on the $250,000.\xc2\xa0 On a million -- you said that he would veto on $250,000.\xc2\xa0 On a million, would he veto?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take you -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you said he would veto on $250,000.\xc2\xa0 Will he veto on a million as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said -- I was asked if he would not sign or veto a law that would extend all of the Bush tax cuts, including those for millionaires and billionaires, and the answer is he would not sign that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would he not sign $1 million --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the particulars.\xc2\xa0 His position is clear.\xc2\xa0 It is for $250,000 -- 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 I mean, most of the people watching this -- and thank you for watching -- (laughter) -- will see their tax cuts stay where they are -- their tax levels stay where they are if we extend these tax cuts for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position; it has always been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you say he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign extending all, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t say the same about a million-dollar threshold.\xc2\xa0 It seems like --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you could --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re staking out a claim on what --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s what -- let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that there are different positions -- that people have different positions on this.\xc2\xa0 But where everyone --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some of which you will agree to and some of which you\xe2\x80\x99re not.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No -- where everyone agrees -- everyone that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, in Congress as well as the President -- is that the tax cuts for middle-class Americans, up to earnings of $250,000 for a family, should be extended.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 And the point he was making today is this is great -- here is something that we all agree on, that we all think is good for the American people, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\xc2\xa0 Understanding that we have a stalemate here on some of these bigger issues, let\xe2\x80\x99s do something that we all agree on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re leaving the door open on a million?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is no door open?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He would not sign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He announced today what his position is.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes -- sorry, Chuck, and then Wendell.\xc2\xa0 Chuck first.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I just -- can you actually clear up, there is a difference between vetoing and not signing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He would veto.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He would veto an extension --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 An extension of the upper-income Bush tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I think I heard you twice now -- are you directly correlating the Great Recession with the Bush tax cuts?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that the policies of that administration contributed mightily to what became known as the Great Recession -- the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Not just the tax cuts, maybe -- I mean, in terms of our fiscal picture, two wars that weren\xe2\x80\x99t paid for didn\xe2\x80\x99t help; a Medicare expansion that was unpaid for didn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\xc2\xa0 There were a lot of contributors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is absolutely the case -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered it, too, Chuck -- was that the campaign for those tax cuts was mounted on the idea that it would be beneficial for every American, for the whole American economy.\xc2\xa0 And now that -- with the benefit of hindsight, we know that\xe2\x80\x99s not what happened.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, that the period before that, when wealthier Americans paid a higher rate -- not a historically high rate by any means, but a higher -- a slightly higher rate, the economy did significantly better.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd of course there are different factors that contribute to that.\xc2\xa0 But we know that this policy did not work.\xc2\xa0 It just did not work -- because even before the crisis, even before things began to go really south in 2007, you had a situation where middle-class incomes were stagnating, where we had the slowest job creation of any expansion in recent memory.\xc2\xa0 So something wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working, and those economic policies were not working.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President today, he said, let\xe2\x80\x99s not hold the middle class tax rates hostage to the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 How, by issuing a veto threat -- if they all came to your desk, for all of the extension -- is that not the -- are you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the point is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, is it -- could the same -- could they -- could the Republicans say the same thing about the President, that he\xe2\x80\x99s holding the same tax cuts hostage to the wealthy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the point -- and I think the President was making this very clearly earlier today, is that there is a great deal of disagreement about whether or not the wealthiest of Americans should see their tax cuts extended at the cost of $65 billion for one year, over $800 billion over 10; hundreds and hundreds of billions more if you did it permanently as the way -- as some Republicans would have us do it.\xc2\xa0 There is no debate about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s an issue of extending all of the Bush tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 The issue is can we find something here that we all agree on that\'s good for the economy and good for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that is extending the tax cuts for 98 percent of American taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President talked about today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying, let\xe2\x80\x99s be realistic about the stalemate that we have here because of this position that Republicans have taken that nothing moves unless millionaires and billionaires and the wealthiest Americans get their tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is about decoupling.\xc2\xa0 This is about decoupling the middle class from the upper income so that there\xe2\x80\x99s two separate debates --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that\'s one way --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because of political leverage, the other side has had too much leverage under this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s one way to look at it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because we all agree that -- the President disagrees.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that extending tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires is good economic policy.\xc2\xa0 Democrats don\'t believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s good economic policy.\xc2\xa0 He does believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s good economic policy to extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpaying Americans, and so do Republicans.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\xc2\xa0 And if supporters of extending tax cuts for wealthier Americans want to have the debate about that, we should and we will.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in many ways one of the most dominant issues of this campaign thus far.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure it will be going forward.\xc2\xa0 And there is great disagreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the President says, there\'s a stalemate -- that\'s the bad news.\xc2\xa0 The good news is that the American people get to resolve the stalemate on those issues.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of extending middle-class tax cuts, there isn\'t disagreement, so let\'s extend them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Egyptian President -- do you have anything to confirm right now as far as when President Obama is going to meet with him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will be going to UNGA, the United Nations General Assembly, in September.\xc2\xa0 And he will, I\'m sure, encounter a number of leaders.\xc2\xa0 After all, that\'s a gathering of world leaders, including the new Egyptian President there.\xc2\xa0 He is not -- there are no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are no planned --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are no planned bilateral meetings in Washington around UNGA with any leader.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here in Washington, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct, or there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there -- but that could change -- could anything change in Washington?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s nothing planned.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to meeting the new President of Egypt at UNGA.\xc2\xa0 They have not met, and they will both be participating at the UN General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 That is really the only issue here in terms of the reports.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they will have a one-on-one in some form or that\'s not 100 percent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, there\'s nothing scheduled like that.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just, they will meet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Encounter each other.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Encounter each other.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President said one of the reasons for today\'s proposal was to provide certainty for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Where\'s the certainty in a one-year extension?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President very much supports permanent extension of tax cuts for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 Under his presidency, he has lowered taxes for middle-class Americans every year he has been in office.\xc2\xa0 But the proposal today to extend it for one year recognizes that there are broader issues of tax reform that are highly contested, that unless there\'s a real break in the logjam will not be resolved before the election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo a one-year extension provides certainty for a year, it does a great benefit for the economy, and it saves the money that every baseline that your news organization relies on assumes will be spent on tax cuts for the higher-income Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it leaves until later the bigger issues -- a broader tax reform, which the President supports, and of a balanced approach to medium- and long-term deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Norah\'s question, in 2010, the President said, a bad time to raise taxes, at a time when growth was substantially higher than it is right now.\xc2\xa0 So I must assume that now is a good time to raise taxes on the wealthier Americans, because he doesn\'t have as part of the deal the extension of jobless benefits and the extension of the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I addressed this.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, as do independent economists, that as a matter of macroeconomic policy, what\'s good for the broader economy -- extending tax cuts for the middle class, 98 percent of taxpaying Americans -- is good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 Under any scenario, the positive impact of extending them for higher-income Americans is greatly outweighed by the expansion in the deficits that\'s brought about by extending them.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that is good economic policy.\xc2\xa0 At the time --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he spoke, at the time, to growth at the time.\xc2\xa0 And at the time, growth was almost twice as high as it is right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His broader point was about the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people, not for the 2 percent at the higher end.\xc2\xa0 The fact was, at the time that was what could be agreed on then.\xc2\xa0 Right now, where we have agreement -- where we all agree, where the President agrees with every Republican and Democrat in Congress that I know of -- is that tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people ought to be extended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\'s pass that and sign it, and continue to have the debate about whether it makes good economic sense to extend tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 -- including millionaires and billionaires, whom this President believes do not need the tax cut at a time when we need to get our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And where is he on the payroll tax rate right now?\xc2\xa0 Does he support another extension of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut is a temporary measure, as we made clear at the time and made clear at the extension, is it\'s far too early at this point to say what -- whether the payroll tax cut that was put in place for one year and then extended for a year is something that we would look at in December.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- this is a separate issue from the income tax rates that are the focus of the middle-class --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to say now, let the payroll tax cut expire in December?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 No, because that\'s -- that was a -- look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position again on the broader middle-class tax cuts is that they should be made permanent, that those rates should be made permanent.\xc2\xa0 Recognizing the stalemate that\'s in Washington, he proposed extending those tax cuts for the middle class for one year to create economic certainty for them, and to create a positive effect for the broader American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe payroll tax cut is a temporary measure, and it was extended at the end of last year and early this year because the economic circumstances demanded it.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very controversial issue, as we saw, because of the great reluctance displayed by Republicans for week after week after week to extend the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s point today is, let\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledge that the contentious issues are going to be hard to resolve now, but we should be able to do something on an issue that we all agree on, which is extending the middle-class tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis, then Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can we go back to sequestration for a second?\xc2\xa0 Thousands and thousands of workers are going to get pink slips who work with the government in some private contractors, small businesses, because their companies are going to be obligated to give them those pink slips sometimes 90 days before the sequestration goes into effect -- or it could be longer, depending on their policies.\xc2\xa0 But you were just saying that the President would be content to leave that until much later in the year.\xc2\xa0 So this has a direct job impact, the sequestration --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He would not be content, Alexis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s your word.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President would -- if there was a willingness by Congress --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so that\'s my question.\xc2\xa0 That\'s my question --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to do what everybody says it should do, which is recognize that the sequester imposes policies that nobody wants.\xc2\xa0 And by definition, it\xe2\x80\x99s a forcing mechanism to get Congress to make tough choices -- in this case, to deal with our medium- and long-term deficit issues with a balanced plan.\xc2\xa0 The President would -- again, would welcome a breakthrough right now.\xc2\xa0 He certainly thinks that would be positive for the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question was, if the President was eager today to talk about a one-year extension as a way to try to mitigate one part of the disagreement, because there is some meeting of the minds, there\xe2\x80\x99s also some meeting of the minds about sequestration, right?\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been proposals to temporarily extend.\xc2\xa0 So my question was, will the President today or this week also say, come talk to me, let\xe2\x80\x99s do a temporary extension?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President today was talking about tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything speculative for you about sequestration except we all know what we need to do.\xc2\xa0 There is -- the point of the sequester -- and remember Republicans voted for this, as well as Democrats -- was to force Congress to make some tough choices, and that meant tough for everybody -- not just tough for one side -- to implement the kinds of policies that would get our fiscal house in order over the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that requires a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 It requires hard choices for Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It requires significant non-defense, discretionary cuts; cuts in programs that affect a lot of people -- and the President has signed into law substantial, nondefense, discretionary cuts.\xc2\xa0 It requires reforms to our entitlement programs that make them stronger, and reforms that would help the bottom line and help our economy.\xc2\xa0 And it requires an approach to taxes that says that everyone should get a fair shot and everyone should do their fair share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s been the holdup -- that last part -- a refusal to do anything on dealing with the sequester, on tax reform, on our overall budget issues because of this broadly uniform position that they won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything if we don\'t give more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, which just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not good policy.\xc2\xa0 We saw that.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t afford it.\xc2\xa0 We know that.</p>\n<p>\n\tProposals put forward by Republicans in Congress and the broader Republican Party, including the nominee -- likely nominee for President would make the situation much worse in terms of deficits and debt.\xc2\xa0 They would almost without question result in tax hikes for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 This is just bad policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we need to -- again, recognizing that there\xe2\x80\x99s a debate about this, and a stalemate that the American people will settle in November, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the things that we agree on -- and one of them is that we should extend these tax cuts for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President wants to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have one domestic and one foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 On the domestic, by pressing now, does the President believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that he can get this extension done before the election?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why?\xc2\xa0 Is it because he thinks that Republicans will be sort of pressured into a situation where you\xe2\x80\x99re on the campaign trail?\xc2\xa0 Or what\xe2\x80\x99s the argument for why this approach would get this done now instead of at the end of the year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it is not everything that we would need to do.\xc2\xa0 And the reason why he separated this out and said, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this now, is because he does believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad consensus on the need to extend these tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, the Republicans will come to that conclusion as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this discussion in the past when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up here, as well as on the road, about what tactics by the President result in positive momentum legislatively.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last year or so -- or in the last six months or so -- especially the last 10 or 12 months, is that when the President makes a public case for policy that is sensible, that is broadly supported by the American people, and he continues to make that case, that we see the kind of movement that initially seems unlikely in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that will hopefully be the case here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in time --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be -- well, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it depends on --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the convention, when --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, seriously.\xc2\xa0 There are those who will say it\'s never going to happen because the Republicans won\'t extend tax cuts for the middle class unless we extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 And there are those who say that the Republican position of refusing to support tax cuts for the middle class is a very untenable position.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\'s untenable.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard -- it\'s a tough one to explain, why you\'d vote no for extending tax cuts for the middle class when to most people you\'d have that conversation with, it would be nonsensical.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not going to do that?\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to make my taxes go up on average $2,200 on January 1st, just because you insist that somebody who makes $1 million or $2 million or $10 million a year should get a tax cut, too?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\'s have the debate about the high-income stuff later, because we know we disagree on that.\xc2\xa0 We all agree that 98 percent of Americans ought to have their taxes cut again on January 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the foreign policy question -- I just wanted to follow up on the non-meeting meeting with the Egyptian President.\xc2\xa0 So what came out yesterday from Cairo following Burns\xe2\x80\x99 meeting with Morsi was that they would have a meeting at UNGA.\xc2\xa0 What you\'re saying now -- I just want to make sure I understand -- is that it won\'t be like a real-meeting meeting -- it won\'t be a bilateral?\xc2\xa0 They will --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear.\xc2\xa0 There was one report that I think overstated this.\xc2\xa0 I expect that the President will have a chance to meet with or see President Morsi at the UN General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t worked details out of that, but we expect that he will be able to see him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this goes to I think Chuck\'s question -- there hasn\'t been anything worked out and there is no bilateral session planned here with any -- it\'s not about Egypt, but with any leader.\xc2\xa0 Nobody -- they have a lot of world leaders coming to the United States -- to the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 The President has no bilateral meetings planned here in Washington around that.\xc2\xa0 He will obviously see many world leaders while he is up at the United Nations, including, he hopes, the new President of Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of -- maybe you can sort of peel back then -- is part of it that the President wants to sort of see Morsi in action a little bit more before he commits to a bilateral meeting?\xc2\xa0 Or what\'s kind of the politics of how that works?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s be clear -- I don\'t have any bilateral meetings with foreign leaders to announce -- with any foreign leader.\xc2\xa0 He --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it was announced.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t announced.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was -- well, it actually was.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was announced by the Egyptians.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a letter in which -- again, we don\'t have a habit of reading out presidential correspondence.\xc2\xa0 But look at what the Egyptians said.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to seeing President Morsi in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 He will see many leaders there, but many of whom he has met already.\xc2\xa0 He has not met President Morsi.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve been clear that the President\'s position on the $250,000 threshold is a long-held position.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, though, whether the President muddied the message a little bit by so aggressively advocating on behalf of the Buffett tax over the past several months, which obviously sets a threshold of a million dollars a year for a minimum marginal tax rate.\xc2\xa0 Why would it make sense to have $250,000 be the proper cutoff for an extension of a tax cut, but a million be the proper threshold for the imposition of a minimum marginal tax rate?\xc2\xa0 Why are those two different?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are different ways to answer that question.\xc2\xa0 Some of them go to economic policy.\xc2\xa0 The Buffett Rule is a matter of principle that would guide a broader tax reform -- approach to tax reform.\xc2\xa0 And we made that clear.\xc2\xa0 What Warren Buffett said, and what the President supports, is that it is -- does not make sense and it does not seem fair that someone like Warren Buffett, who is a billionaire, would pay taxes on his income at a lower rate than his secretary or somebody like his secretary.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees with that principle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bush tax cuts, the so-called tax cuts, are concrete law the President has long supported.\xc2\xa0 They expire.\xc2\xa0 The concrete -- the President has long supported extending and making permanent the Bush tax cuts, the middle-class tax cuts, for 98 percent of taxpaying Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that is reflected in the announcement he made today, recognizing that there is a lot of debate and disagreement over tax policy in Washington and on the campaign trail, and that getting broader tax reform done, getting broader issues resolved would be very hard.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut here\'s one thing we can all agree on, is that we need to extend these tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpaying Americans, for hardworking Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not just let\'s reward -- let\'s just do that because it\'s 98 percent and it\'s middle class and we\'re all for that.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good economic policy, because we know and you know -- and if you talk to an economist, they\'ll tell you -- that tax cuts for Americans making less than $250,000, and especially for those solidly in the middle class who are making ends meet every week and every month, giving them tax cuts, more money in their pocket and not raising their taxes is good in terms of direct positive impact on economic growth in the near term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\'s a real difference there between -- in terms of the macro issues, the economic growth issues, between tax cuts for middle-class Americans and tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick follow up -- did the White House consult with Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and others who were on the record for a million as the threshold prior to the President\'s announcement today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and we consult with Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House all the time.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it came as a surprise to anyone -- Republican or Democrat in Congress -- that the President supports extending tax cuts for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 But the short answer is yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still believe Kofi Annan is capable of convincing President Assad of accepting the ceasefire?\xc2\xa0 And does he consider this last visit as a last-ditch effort to solve this diplomatically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as Secretary Clinton said and I\xe2\x80\x99ll echo, there is not a lot of time here.\xc2\xa0 President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s behavior has been heinous, and we judge him by his actions, not his words.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President does support Kofi Annan\xe2\x80\x99s mission, does support the plan that Mr. Annan has put forward -- because we need that transition for the benefit of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And it is not one person alone who will bring about that transition in Syria, certainly not Kofi Annan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, President Assad -- if he would finally do the right thing and step aside -- could help facilitate it more than any one individual could.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s broad international support for Kofi Annan\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and it is that pressure that we believe and we hope will ultimately lead to a political transition in Syria that creates a better future for the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And that future cannot happen with Assad still in power, in our view.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, April.\xc2\xa0 And then -- sorry, what\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\xe2\x80\x99re next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, President Obama has many hats.\xc2\xa0 And in the four months leading up to November as President -- not as campaigner, but as President -- what can the American public expect to see from him in these last four months before the election as President, not as campaigner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you saw today the one thing that he wants to get done as President with the help of Congress is an extension of tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people, middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 There are still a number of issues that we can get done that will benefit the economy and benefit job creation if we get some cooperation out of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes you hear people say, we need a plan, we need to see a plan for dealing with the economy and job creation right now -- and the President, as you know, put forward that plan, the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 Some elements of it were passed by Congress, including the extension of the payroll tax cut, but many of those elements were not passed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd outside, independent economists have analyzed those elements -- those un-passed elements of the American Jobs Act -- and said that they would lead to the creation of a million jobs very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Congress ought to act on that.\xc2\xa0 Assuming that everyone on Capitol Hill is concerned with the need to have the economy grow faster and have it create more jobs faster as the President is.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is going to push these issues every day, and you\xe2\x80\x99re right -- he\xe2\x80\x99s campaigning for reelection, but he\xe2\x80\x99s President of the United States every day, and he is interested in making progress on the core issues -- economic growth and job creation -- wherever he sees possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the question I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get, but I thought might is, well, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this -- Republicans are saying this proposal today is political.\xc2\xa0 And my answer to that would be, well, take it away from him.\xc2\xa0 Deprive him of the political benefit by passing it and signing -- and getting it signed into law.\xc2\xa0 And then everybody can go on and discuss other issues.\xc2\xa0 Because he knows that would be good for the American people and good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 So nothing would make him happier than Republicans in Congress voting in the way that they say they believe, which is that 98 percent of Americans ought to get their tax cuts extended in January.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, and then you\xe2\x80\x99re next.\xc2\xa0 Victoria, and then -- sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, you just said there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of time here.\xc2\xa0 Not a lot of time before what?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- I appreciate the question -- and as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, the situation in Syria continues to deteriorate because Assad refuses to stop brutally assaulting his own people and murdering them.\xc2\xa0 The risk, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, is that that situation will dissolve into a broader, sectarian civil war -- they could have broader implications for the region, could involve other nations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a terrible outcome for the world as well as the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is why it is so essential that the international community come together in support of the Annan plan and in support of the basic principle that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future can only be brighter if a brutal dictator who has overseen the massacre of his own people in these past 14 or 15 months steps aside and is no longer a part of the Syrian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet, the first point of the Annan plan, which is ceasefire, isn\xe2\x80\x99t even working.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, that Assad has refused to live up to his own commitments, not for the first time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why whenever Assad says something that sounds good, sounds like progress, we remain highly skeptical because we in the world have seen that he routinely fails to live up to his obligation, that he routinely fails to keep his promises, that he makes promises about implementing a ceasefire or creating some progress, and then continues to brutally assault his own people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have said and have been quite clear about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re skeptical about Assad\xe2\x80\x99s intentions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has to go, in our view.\xc2\xa0 He long ago gave up any claim he might have had to being a participant in a transition to a better future for Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 You saw in recent meetings that the opposition is coming together, that the international consensus is growing.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to press on every front to bring about a transition in Syria that will produce a future that the Syrian people -- or give Syria a chance to produce a future that the Syrian people deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final question.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe there is any international mechanism for producing a result in Syria without Russia and China?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear that Russia and China and the United States have disagreements about Syria, and that we strongly disagree with the vetoes that those countries put forth on measures before the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continue to have discussions with the Russians and the Chinese in a very blunt and clear fashion about why we think we need to come together around the proposition that a transition needs to take place -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement on that -- and that that transition cannot include Assad.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to have conversations with the Russians about this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our fundamental point is, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s -- it is in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interest to stand by Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our point to those in his inner circle, to those in the military and governmental leadership.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a great number of defections, including a recent high-level military defection, somebody from Assad\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it is our message internationally that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, as a matter of self-interest for any nation to stand by an international pariah.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for the future relations of any country with the Syrian people to stand by Assad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think Jim, I owe you one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Speaks in Russian.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Speaks in Russian.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Speaks in Russian.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith the federal debt approaching $16 trillion, does the President\xe2\x80\x99s call for continued tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, as he repeatedly said today, and thus preventing huge revenue increases that would help reduce the debt -- does that represent an acknowledgement by him that the economy is still doing poorly and that his previous steps to boost it have not worked?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President says all the time, as recently as Thursday and Friday, that the economy is not where it needs to be.\xc2\xa0 While we have made progress, we are nowhere finished with the job of digging out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is satisfied with economic growth below where we want it to be and job creation below where we want it to be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have 28 straight months of private sector job creation -- 4.4 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that would be -- that is progress.\xc2\xa0 And that would seem like even greater progress if we hadn\'t created -- if the situation that we inherited didn\'t result in the loss of more than 8 million jobs; if we didn\'t have a situation where in the fourth quarter of 2008, before this President took office, the economy shrank by nearly 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 I mean, think of that.\xc2\xa0 The GDP shrank by nearly 9 percent in one quarter.\xc2\xa0 So we have a long way to go, and the President makes that clear all the time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, in terms of the benefits of extending the middle-class tax cuts -- this President\'s position all along -- we need to follow policies that help the middle class grow, create security for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s whole economic vision is premised upon the idea that we grow from the middle class out.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t trickle down from the top and hope that the middle class benefits.\xc2\xa0 That maybe once sounded like sensible economic policy, but it\'s been implemented and it didn\'t work.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what does work are policies that focus on creating more security for and expanding the middle class, and that\'s what the President has been focused on.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, is that every baseline -- to go to your point about the deficit -- that your news organizations rely on in terms of what the deficit looks like in years going forward assumes the extension of all the tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 And by not extending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, we actually save $65 billion in this one year, over $800 billion over 10, close to a trillion if you include everything.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s the right economic policy.\xc2\xa0 We need to take measures that help the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We need to ask the wealthiest Americans to do their fair share.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the President\'s belief.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:21 P.M.
