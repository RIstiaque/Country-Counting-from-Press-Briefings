Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t10:52 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki is here to meet with the President.\xc2\xa0 You will be seeing them both fairly soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if I could just note, this is a momentous visit because, as you know, the Iraq war -- a war that we\'ve been engaged in for 8 and a half years -- is over.\xc2\xa0 And after eight and a half years of sacrifice, America\'s war in Iraq is coming to an end.\xc2\xa0 Since President Obama took office, nearly 150,000 U.S. troops have been removed from Iraq and hundreds of bases have been shut down.\xc2\xa0 In the next two weeks the final U.S. forces will cross the border.\xc2\xa0 For the first time in over eight years no U.S. troops will be preparing to deploy to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We will have no bases in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The war is over and the troops are coming home.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe honor all Americans who have served in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Nearly 4,500 Americans made the ultimate sacrifice there; thousands more have been wounded.\xc2\xa0 Over a million have served, and their families have sacrificed.\xc2\xa0 Under tough circumstances, our troops and civilians have fulfilled every mission.\xc2\xa0 As we end the war, we pay tribute to these Americans who have sacrificed so much.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will keep it to that so we can get to questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The House Republican proposal to extend the payroll tax includes pay-fors and offsets that freeze federal pay.\xc2\xa0 You said on Friday that that would result in cuts to programs like education and energy.\xc2\xa0 Now, the President agreed to about a trillion dollars in cuts in the budget act this summer.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t that result in cuts to programs like education and energy?\xc2\xa0 And are you raising those hypothetically, or can you point specifically to programs that would --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I understand is in the Republican proposal you\'re talking about -- they didn\xe2\x80\x99t spell out where the cuts would come.\xc2\xa0 And I get that they were trying to hide the fact that this would be the result, but by violating the caps that were written into the Budget Control Act, by violating the agreement and lowering the spending caps, there is no other way to do it.\xc2\xa0 The result would be cuts in non-defense discretionary programs, education, and clean energy, veterans programs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the effect of their proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s wrong for a number of reasons, beginning with the abrogation of the deal that Republicans and Democrats made and the President signed into law just a few short months ago.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the perfect example of the kind of chicanery that you get in Washington where your word is no longer your word just a few months later if it\'s not politically expedient.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they specify how you reach those cuts through the pay freezes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But they lower the caps -- the pay freeze is only part of it.\xc2\xa0 They lower the caps and there\'s no other way to do it and certainly no other way that they would do it than forcing these other reductions.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s just not the right way to go about this, because you do not want to harm the very middle-class Americans and working Americans through this provision that you\'re trying to help by extending a payroll tax cut and ensuring that their taxes don\'t go up in a mere 19 days, 13 hours, 3 minutes and 42 seconds.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we continue to hope that we can make progress on this.\xc2\xa0 As you all have seen, there\'s been steady movement by Republicans on, first, very lukewarm or non-support for the payroll tax cut extension, then lukewarm support.\xc2\xa0 And gradually, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting more and more positive support from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 So we expect that -- or we hope that this will result in a deal that is fair, and that ensures that Americans do not have their taxes go up on January 1.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a completely different subject.\xc2\xa0 President Medvedev has ordered an investigation of allegations surrounding last week\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary elections in Russia.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S.<br/>\n\t-- the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the feeling about the fact that tens of thousands of people were able to demonstrate peacefully without any kind of interference by security forces over the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take the second part of your question first.\xc2\xa0 The demonstrations that occurred in Moscow and in many other Russian cities last Saturday represent a very positive sign to all those who support the democratic process.\xc2\xa0 Russian government authorities allowed the demonstrations to take place and refrained from interfering in them.\xc2\xa0 Russian demonstrators abided by the law and held peaceful meetings.\xc2\xa0 Both the Russian government and society leaders seemed to be looking for a dialogue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are encouraged -- to go to your other point -- by President Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to this have the central election commission investigate all election violations, and we welcome what appears to be a new era of tolerance for the freedom of assembly.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just real quick on payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are pointing out this morning that Dan Boren, the conservative Democrat from Oklahoma, is agreeing with you that the payroll tax cut should be extended, but is saying they should include the pipeline in there because that\xe2\x80\x99s the art of the compromise.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans want the pipeline in there, the President wants the payroll tax cut extension, he wants the unemployment extension, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s on\xc2\xa0 60 Minutes last night talking about how Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t meet him halfway.\xc2\xa0 Why not listen to a conservative Democrat who\xe2\x80\x99s saying, meet the Republicans halfway?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I love about your question is that it shines such a bright light on the highly politicized nature of Republican support -- lukewarm support -- for a tax cut for 160 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re basically saying, we should do -- we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a favor to you, President Obama, by voting for this payroll tax cut extension; otherwise, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 If we don\'t get our political scalp, if we don\'t get to include ideological issues in the budget, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t do it -- which I think is pretty alarming as a message to constituents of Republican members of the Senate and the House, because they used to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it was a Democrat --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, a Democrat endorsing --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- saying he wanted --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get that you found -- I get that the Republicans found a Democrat to endorse their point of view here. But the point of view here is essentially suggesting that there is a political tradeoff to be had that extending tax cuts for middle-class and working Americans should only occur in return for a political gift or an ideological item that some Republicans are insisting on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think we all need to step back and say, what happened to Republican support for tax cuts?\xc2\xa0 They\'re so passionate about it when it comes to defending extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest earners.\xc2\xa0 They\'re so passionate about the apparently unfindable job creators who would be affected by a surtax on millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to most Americans who get a paycheck, who need that extra 1,000 bucks, or 1,550 bucks next year to make ends meet, they\'re like, well, not so much, unless I get this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But didn\'t you have to do that over the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to extend the debt ceiling, Republicans wanted to cut spending, and you came to a deal.\xc2\xa0 You came to a deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, the -- this is about an issue that is supposed to be item number one in Republican political parlance, which is, we are for tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one.\xc2\xa0 Two, if you want to go back there, you\'re saying that Democrats are -- President Obama wanted to extend the debt ceiling -- what, are you suggesting Republicans didn\'t?\xc2\xa0 Because that\'s a novel -- well, some didn\'t.\xc2\xa0 They were willing to see the United States have its --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were on record as doing that, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the full faith and credit of the United States government --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They said that over and over.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, not -- I mean, some elements of the Republican Party did.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, again, you\'re framing it in a way that I don\'t think is particularly flattering in terms of the motivations.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll let that stand as it is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we simply disagree.\xc2\xa0 It is not the right thing to do to take that approach.\xc2\xa0 And if that is the approach that is taken, then I think there\'s going to be a lot of explaining that needs to be done to Americans around the country as to why their taxes are going up on January 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back, by the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve heard a lot of talk about building a durable friendship, an enduring partnership.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk just a little bit about what the strategic partnership will look like between the U.S. and Iraq, and whether -- how much monetary aid and for how long will be part of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specific proposals or initiatives to lay out, but it is absolutely the case that our relationship with Iraq will remain strong; that the intensity of our engagement at the economic, diplomatic, cultural, educational, as well as security levels will remain strong; and we will have a significant presence in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have invested an enormous amount in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future, we have had so many Americans sacrifice so much for the future of that country that it is very much in our interest to maintain a positive relationship with Iraq and to build on what is a very strong foundation in that relationship.\xc2\xa0 But it will be a relationship between two sovereign nations, and it will be a relationship similar to the kinds that we have with other countries around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for specifics in terms of the nature of the programs and things that we might have and that we might engage in with Iraq, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to others for later.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on that significant presence?\xc2\xa0 And is there any possibility at all on whether U.S. troops will return as trainers at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the State Department has specifics in terms of what the civilian presence will be going forward in Iraq, so I would refer to them in terms of the size of the civilian presence.\xc2\xa0 And we have always said that we would welcome a continuing security relationship with Iraq.\xc2\xa0 What is the case is we will not have bases -- we do not have bases there, and we are removing all of our troops from Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we do have security relationships with countries that involve training and things like that, but that is distinct from what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing happen now, which is the fulfillment of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to end the war responsibly and to withdraw all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me go to Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be talking to -- is the President talking to al-Maliki about cracking down on his political opponents, about the importance of a democratic foundation?\xc2\xa0 How secure is the administration in believing that there is a democratic foundation that\xe2\x80\x99s being left behind as the U.S. leaves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, politics is always a topic of discussion between the President and the Prime Minister, as well as our conversations with Iraqi leaders at other levels, including with the Vice President, who, as you know, has spent a great deal of time on this issue for the last nearly three years.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is the case is that while no one would argue that the system has been perfected in Iraq, it is simply true that politics has broken out in Iraq, and that, by and large, political decisions are brought to -- or, rather, that the parties in Iraq -- and by parties, I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean political parties -- but that people come to the table to work out their political differences peacefully rather than through force.\xc2\xa0 And that was a major change from 2007, 2008 -- 2006, 2007, 2008, in terms of how the different political parties and the different segments of society worked out their differences.\xc2\xa0 And we very much believe that the Iraqis can continue to move forward on that tremendous progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But al-Maliki has told newspapers there and the media that -- the fledgling media there that he won\xe2\x80\x99t honor the election of the people who oppose his stands, that sort thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.\xc2\xa0 Look, there has been steady progress and the results have been ups and downs as we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through that progress over the number of years that this administration has been overseeing American policy in Iraq.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we always, in our dealings with the Iraqis and both the Prime Minister and other Iraqi leaders from other parties, are always focused on the need to be democratic, to be representative, to ensure that the rights of all Iraqis are respected, and that these differences are worked out peacefully through the process.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to press the Iraqis with that advice and that point of view as we further develop our relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Two more, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just going to do a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President and the Prime Minister to address the issue of the remaining U.S. detainee Ali Mussa Daqduq?\xc2\xa0 As you know, some Republicans are insisting that U.S. forces retain custody.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The discussions about that individual continue. I don\'t have any more information about it for you, but those discussions do continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, can you react to the fact that the high court is going to look at the Arizona immigration law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did see those reports, and obviously you know the President\xe2\x80\x99s position and this administration\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to arguing our point of view in that case when the time comes.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As this war draws to a close, Jay, does the President think this -- the Iraq war helped or hurt the fight against al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that this President made clear as a candidate -- as a senator, as a candidate, what his views were and are about how we got into this war.\xc2\xa0 He certainly made the case and continues to believe it to be true that in the previous administration, that by focusing so much of our attention and resources on Iraq, that we took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan and in some ways in our fight against al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis responsibility as President has been to end this war in the best possible way, to give Iraq the best possible chance for the future and to bring American forces home, as he promised he would do.\xc2\xa0 And as we have done that, certainly you have seen in the nearly three years he\xe2\x80\x99s been President, a heightened focus on al Qaeda and some success in taking the fight to al Qaeda and removing leaders of al Qaeda central from the field of battle.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe will continue that effort.\xc2\xa0 The broader narrative here about Iraq and the region will be written by historians.\xc2\xa0 Right now he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on his responsibilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all, very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:09 A.M.
