EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top except to welcome you on Air Force One today as we make our way to North Carolina for our first stop on a two-day, three-stop college tour, where the President will -- on which the President will discuss the vital importance that Congress follow his lead and decide to not allow interest rates to double for student loans, as they will for 7.4 million young Americans on July 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I have two quick questions on the student loans.\xc2\xa0 It seems the debate on the Hill is more about how to pay to extend these than actually whether to extend the rates.\xc2\xa0 So who is the President trying to convince?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s a couple of things here.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we welcome any support that is out there for the idea that we need to take action to make sure that these interest rates do not double.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly welcome, although ironic, that those who fervently support the Ryan budget, which would double interest rates for student loans, some of whom now say they want to not have that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously how we pay for it is important.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely believe it ought to be paid for.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of alternatives for pay-fors that exist in the President\'s budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 And I know that that\'s being discussed on the Hill and we are discussing it with the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is this needs to get done.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve said all year long, when there are opportunities for bipartisan action on things that will help the economy or help, in this case, students prepare themselves to enter the economy, we are glad to see it.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to believe that there are opportunities like this out there despite the fact that it\'s an election year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that Romney\'s support for this extension influences the debate at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we welcome, again, anyone\'s support, any Republican support for this proposal.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has to move through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply note that overwhelmingly Republicans in Congress support the Ryan budget, the Republican budget, that has become essentially the governing doctrine of the Republican Party, and not only does it not include within it any provision to prevent student loan rates from doubling, but it slashes Pell grants and other programs that are essential to ensuring that young Americans get the education they need to compete in the 21st century economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tNot only that, it cuts programs that help -- that invest in the very industries that we need young Americans to be entering in the 21st century economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one of the pay-fors that the Senate Democrats are looking at and they\'ve been talking to the White House about is this closing of the loophole for the S corporations.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President would support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve certainly been in discussions with senators about that.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly an option that is a good potential option.\xc2\xa0 It meets the standard that we set that we can\'t pay for it in a way that would harm students and it would also meet the standard that it wouldn\'t raise taxes on anybody making under $250,000.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to that point, the fact that you guys are not doing something like the Buffett Rule as a pay-for, is this an effort\xc2\xa0 -- do you think that that leaves more of an opening to get Republican support?\xc2\xa0 And in addition to the President going out and trying to gin up support among Americans and students, is he also trying to get support among Republicans on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 Is he talking to those folks?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like it\'s time to reach out to try and reach some sort of an agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We want Congress to act and do the right thing here.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously in contact with Congress on this --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is not -- there\'s no mystery here about how to get this done.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of options for paying for it.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not wedded to one.\xc2\xa0 We\'re wedded to principles that govern the decision-making here that -- the red lines that we have about where we can\'t go to pay for things like this and where we can go.\xc2\xa0 The provision that you mentioned is one that we could support.\xc2\xa0 Certainly there are other alternatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Republicans -- Senator McConnell and the chairman of the Republican North Carolina state party are saying today that the events about student loans are really kind of beside the point because there\'s not enough jobs out there for people graduating from college, and therefore the President\'s policies are failing young people.\xc2\xa0 Do you want to respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I find it highly ironic that a United States Senator, who enthusiastically, with great gusto and energy, supported the policies of the previous administration that contributed mightily to the worst recession since the Great Depression, comes forward with a statement like that, even though he opposed all the policies that have led to 25 straight months of private sector job creation and 10 quarters of positive economic growth as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression -- the policies -- and he supported the policies that led to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Senator Grassley is asking for some details of the White House Counsel\'s inquiry into what the staff was up to in Cartagena.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House is ready to provide?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen -- I know that there\'s a letter. I haven\'t seen it, so I don\'t have any specific response to that. I would just point you to the fact that there is no credible, specific allegation of any misconduct by anybody on the White House advance team or White House staff.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution and with due diligence, the White House Counsel oversaw a review of the personnel on the White House advance team, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication of any misconduct.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I said yesterday, if there were an indication, we would obviously look at, but there isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 So there you go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any problem with the White House answering Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s letter then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the letter.\xc2\xa0 I have no response to that letter.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office conducted a review; there has been no credible, specific allegation of any misconduct by anybody on the White House advance team, White House staff, and that review produced no indication that there was misconduct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any comments on the Sudan versus South Sudan developments today?\xc2\xa0 And also, will the White House at any point talk to us in more detail about the President being briefed on Bo Xilai and that incident?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We strongly condemn Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s military incursion into South Sudan.\xc2\xa0 Sudan must immediately halt the aerial and artillery bombardment in South Sudan by the Sudan armed forces.\xc2\xa0 Both governments must agree to an immediate, unconditional cessation of hostilities and recommit to negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the President said in his message to the people of Sudan and South Sudan, \xe2\x80\x9cAll those who are fighting must recognize that there is no military solution.\xc2\xa0 The only way to achieve real and lasting security is to resolve your differences through negotiation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'re asking me whether -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President is aware of and has been briefed on this matter, but what --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any details?\xc2\xa0 Because it\'s been -- just wondering if at any point you would have any details.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- when he was first briefed on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On what?\xc2\xa0 Bo Xilai?\xc2\xa0 I would have to ask.\xc2\xa0 I assume -- well, I would just -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll check.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, anything on -- North Korea seems to be close to another missile -- preparing for another missile launch.\xc2\xa0 Any update on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We strongly suggest that the North Koreans refrain from engaging in any other -- any more hostile or provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 They do nothing to advance the cause of peace on the nuclear -- on the North Korean -- or rather the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia.\xc2\xa0 And they certainly do nothing to help the North Korean people, many of whom are starving because of the predilection of the North Korean regime to spend the money it has on weapons systems rather than food and economic development.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s very graceful.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 by all of us -- by all of us.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry -- I thought the flight was longer.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can take a few more if you\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While we\xe2\x80\x99re here in North Carolina, is the President going to say anything about the issue on the ballot next week on civil unions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that.\xc2\xa0 The campaign put out a statement about his position on it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is he doing the college journal roundtable conference call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any comment on this report on Social Security -- I know you talked about Medicare yesterday -- but the report that shows it\xe2\x80\x99s going to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I think I addressed it yesterday, but since the questioner on that issue got many of the facts wrong in his questions, I will say that Social Security and Medicare trustees report makes clear that the Affordable Care Act extended the life of the Medicare trust fund and that Social Security will continue to pay benefits for decades to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that we must do more to secure these programs for future generations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has proposed additional reforms to strengthen Medicare and called for bipartisan work to strengthen Social Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will again point out that without the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare trust fund would be bankrupt in 2016.\xc2\xa0 Health care reform has extended the life of the trust fund by an additional eight years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your indulgence.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:39 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
