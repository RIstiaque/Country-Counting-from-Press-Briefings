EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for getting on.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to do a quick call to preview a portion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, the housekeeping.\xc2\xa0 This is background.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re joined by three senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 If you need sourcing information, let me know -- you know, for editors.\xc2\xa0 I can help you with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are talking with a 9:00 p.m. Eastern this evening embargo.\xc2\xa0 You can have this in papers tomorrow, you can have it online at 9:00 p.m., but we would like to give everyone a chance to write as long as they can before anything goes online.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So 9:00 p.m. embargo tonight, background.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, we would like to talk today about some of the economic proposals the President is going to put forward tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 These are new; they\xe2\x80\x99re newsworthy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to talk about every element of the speech today.\xc2\xa0 I know there are a lot of other issues in the Middle East and North Africa that folks are interested in.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into all of those today, just be as straightforward as possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to our first senior administration official.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Tommy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a few things by way of introduction.\xc2\xa0 The President will give a speech tomorrow on the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 As we said, this comes at a moment of opportunity in the region and for U.S. policy in the region.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously coming off of a decade of great tension and division across the region, and now, having wound down the Iraq war and continuing to do so, and having taken out Osama bin Laden, we are beginning to turn the page to a more positive and hopeful future for U.S. policy in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, that is reinforced, of course, by the peaceful movement for democratic change that has swept across the region for the last six months.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President will have the opportunity to speak broadly about the change in the Middle East and North Africa, the implications for U.S. policy, and some concrete proposals for American policy going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This obviously has a range of components, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing a range of issues, but we wanted to focus on one particular portion of the speech, which is the one that is focused on, the promotion of the economic development and support of democratic change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the political movements of nonviolent protests that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen are rooted in part in a lack of opportunity in the region.\xc2\xa0 You have very large populations of young people, many of whom -- too many of whom cannot find a job.\xc2\xa0 You have a history not just of political rights being restricted but of economic corruption that has also frustrated opportunity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that some of the protests in the region are deeply rooted in a lack of individual opportunity and economic growth, as well as a suppression of political rights.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also know from our study of the past that successful transitions to democracy depend in part on strong foundations for prosperity, and that reinforcing economic growth is an important way of reinforcing a democratic transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as we look at the steps that the United States can take to support democracy in the Middle East and North Africa, one of the most important areas for us to focus on is supporting positive economic growth that, again, can incentivize and reinforce those countries that are transitioning to democracy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a portion of the speech tomorrow will focus on that.\xc2\xa0 And before I turn it over to my colleague, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just note that, in particular, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on those nations that have already begun their democratic transitions, in particular Egypt and Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 And we see this as a critical window of time for the United States to take some concrete action to demonstrate our commitment to their future and to, again, reinforce their democratic transition with support for a broader base of prosperity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleague.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, thank you.\xc2\xa0 As my colleague just noted, economic modernization is key to building both a stronger foundation for prosperity and showing the fruits of democratic change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s clear when you look at this region is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a very diverse group of countries with diverse characteristics and economies.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got major oil producers, but also countries that are dependent on oil imports from their neighbors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The pace of economic reform across the region is uneven.\xc2\xa0 And even in countries that have had substantial economic growth, the benefits of that growth have not necessarily been widely shared.\xc2\xa0 What all these countries share, though, is untapped potential of its people.\xc2\xa0 A majority of the population is under 30 -- 4 million people entering the labor force every year.\xc2\xa0 In Egypt alone, youth unemployment was estimated to be 30 percent.\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to be done to ensure that the benefits of economic growth and reform are benefitting -- are widely shared and are bringing people into the work force and providing jobs and opportunities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the beginning of this -- of the upheaval, representatives of the U.S. government have been in consultations with people in the region.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be laying out a vision tomorrow for the region of what it can be long-term and its role in the world.\xc2\xa0 And as part of that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be announcing a series of initiatives to support that long-term vision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our approach is based around four broad pillars, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention the broad pillars and my colleague will go into further details under several of these.\xc2\xa0 First is support for better economic management.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from the transition experience in Central and Eastern Europe, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to provide support on policy formulation and economic management, along with our support for democratization.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll use a number of programs to support NGOs, universities, think tanks, and others who can help contribute to economic policymaking in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second pillar is support for economic stability.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, as part of this -- of the upheaval, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a series of economic implications.\xc2\xa0 Growth forecasts have been revised downward.\xc2\xa0 International reserves have decreased.\xc2\xa0 Budget deficits are widening.\xc2\xa0 And the international community will need to come together to take steps in the context of reform to ensure financial stability across the region.\xc2\xa0 And my colleague will go into more details about specific steps that the U.S. is prepared to take in that context.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thirdly is support for economic modernization and reform.\xc2\xa0 And very much key to the future of this region is the development of a strong private sector, entrepreneurial sector that can create jobs and bring young people -- who I mentioned earlier -- suffer from high unemployment rates into the workforce.\xc2\xa0 There are institutions and experience out there in facilitating this transition, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking a number of steps to ensure that the international financial institutions and others are supportive of this modernization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, fourth, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to develop a framework for trade integration and investment.\xc2\xa0 If you take out oil exports, the countries of this region, 400 million people, export about the same amount of goods as Switzerland does with only 8 million people.\xc2\xa0 The countries are not terribly well integrated with each other, nor are they terribly well integrated into the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking a number of step-by-step initiatives to facilitate more robust trade within the region and to facilitate -- do trade facilitation, to build on existing agreements, to promote greater integration with the U.S. and Europe, and to open the door for those countries who adopt high standards of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, let me turn it over to my colleague for further details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of specifically how we will stand with the people of Egypt and Tunisia -- as they transform their economies to ensure fairer treatment for all their citizens and to expand opportunities, particularly for the young -- first, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to galvanize support from the international community.\xc2\xa0 The multilateral institutions have a huge role to play here.\xc2\xa0 They have a lot of experience to bring to bear, which they gathered during the transitions in Central and Eastern Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the multilateral development banks -- the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the IMF -- are working with us and with other partners to bring resources to bear and also help these countries develop fundamental transformations of their economy that will allow vendors to provide for their families with dignity, women to get loans to start businesses, and of course that young people should be able to find jobs to build a better future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs part of this, we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to reorienting the European bank for reconstruction development to support the transitions unfolding in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the EBRD played a critical role in supporting political and economic transitions in Eastern Europe over the past two decades, in particular by investing in the private sector and promoting important reforms and economic governance that foster stability and opportunity, as well as democracy.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to ask the EBRD to play a similarly transformative role today.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly important because the EBRD has a specific democracy mandate, and so it will create strong incentives for countries in the region to implement reform that provide the economic underpinnings for political freedom and for strong democracies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn addition, to help Egypt in meeting its critical and very important development needs, the United States is developing a new mechanism.\xc2\xa0 It can essentially channel resources by canceling debts from the past to provide investments for the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that will essentially address dual objectives.\xc2\xa0 It will reduce Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s external debt burden and provide important cash flow relief in a period in which that is particularly important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd secondly it\xe2\x80\x99ll channel additional resources to address Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s medium-term development needs, in particular building a new inclusive economy that will generate more private sector jobs and more opportunities for young people.\xc2\xa0 And of course we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask our partners to join us in this initiative.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs another part of our effort to help Egypt invest in its people and regain access to global capital markets and investment, we will guarantee up to a billion dollars in borrowing to finance infrastructure and support job creation through our Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd finally, we are very supportive of efforts to obtain authorizations to establish an Egyptian-American enterprise fund which also will help with the goals of stimulating private sector investment and promoting projects that generate jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo together we think these initiatives will help Egypt and Tunisia as they undertake the twin challenges of economic transformation and democratization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Great, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks.\xc2\xa0 What is the total dollar estimate of the entire program that you\xe2\x80\x99re -- that the President is going to announce?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, one of the briefers mentioned the well-documented history of corruption in these countries.\xc2\xa0 What safeguards are planned to make sure that U.S. funds don\'t go the wrong way or perhaps end up in the wrong hands of groups or entities that are a threat to the U.S.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\'ll say a word about anti-corruption and how this fits into our overall agenda.\xc2\xa0 As you may know, we have been pursuing a broad anti-corruption agenda since the beginning of the administration.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been evident through the OECD, through the G20, and through a number of bilateral discussions that are making real traction internationally in that effort.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has underscored repeatedly, including going back and talking about the experience of his own -- with his knowledge of Africa about the pernicious effect of corruption and how it can diminish economic growth and demoralize a population.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think in this regard, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing a number of programs as part of our overall effort on anti-corruption and be working with countries in the region to ensure that new governments there are taking this -- are taking this seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I would only note that it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a global effort that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on open government transparency and anti-corruption.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to note that today the President signed an executive order expanding sanctions, to include Syrian President Assad for human rights violations.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that Assad, through his actions, had made his intentions clear, and of course Vice President Biden has said that a leader who commits atrocities against his people has lost his legitimacy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does the President agree with Secretary Clinton and Vice President Biden, and will he call for Assad to step down from power in his speech tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put that in the category of things you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wait for the speech tomorrow to get more clarity on.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to -- if you have any other questions --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, let me try again.\xc2\xa0 Can you please give us some details in terms of how you plan to get money towards Egypt and Tunisia?\xc2\xa0 Has this been coordinated with Congress?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the scale of it and what types of assistance are you looking at?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me jump in on that.\xc2\xa0 So on -- in terms of the scale of assistance, we are talking, of course, with our authorizers and appropriators, and they have given their thoughts as well in helping to design some of these initiatives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the scale, we anticipate that the debt swap, both relief of debt and the investments that would ensue, would amount to roughly $1 billion over a few years, and that the loan guarantees would support roughly an additional billion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be additional financing coming from the multilateral development banks as well, several billion dollars, and just with regard to the earlier questions that were asked, to reinforce my colleague, these funds, these programs will be available in the context of overall economic reform programs put forward by the Egyptian and the Tunisian governments, and of course both the multilateral development banks and we will expect and I believe the governments will want to use those reform programs to put in place very strong safeguards against corruption and also to ensure that the licensing process is much fairer so that the smallest vendors can get licenses much more easily than has been the case in the past and in a much more transparent and fair manner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we will be looking for these additional support mechanisms to be put forward in the context of deep economic governance reforms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for doing the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 General Jones gave a talk to the National Press Club earlier this week where he called for a Marshall Plan for this region.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you feel what the President is going to propose tomorrow rises to that level.\xc2\xa0 Is this on the scale of a Marshall Plan for the Middle East and North Africa?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a few things and then my colleagues might want to join.\xc2\xa0 I think people ought to be the judge of what are the historical analogies.\xc2\xa0 I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at is how have nations successfully transitioned to democracy in the past?\xc2\xa0 And you of course have the example of post-World War II.\xc2\xa0 You also have the example of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the transitions in Eastern Europe, as well as many other countries around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that\xe2\x80\x99s what important to note is that this has -- this is a plan that has many different components.\xc2\xa0 It of course has the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pursue with our international partners in the World Bank and the IMF.\xc2\xa0 It has the debt swaps and the loan guarantees that my colleague spoke about.\xc2\xa0 It has enterprise funds that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing with Congress that will increase investment in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as the efforts associated with OPIC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, all of which I think draw on that experience of how do we take some of the successful efforts in Eastern Europe and apply them to countries that are transitioning to democracy in the Middle East and in North Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, you have the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking to advance the integration of markets and the trade relationships between the Middle East and North Africa and the United States and the European Union.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a comprehensive approach that, again, is focused on how to foster development that is in service of democratic transition and that enhances opportunity for the people of the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning of a long-term effort, because obviously these transitions will play out over a period of years.\xc2\xa0 Egypt and Tunisia are at the forefront because they\xe2\x80\x99ve already undertaken these steps.\xc2\xa0 And of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope that there are additional transitions to democracy that follow in the years to come.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s just one component of a broader set of tools that the United States brings to bear in the region.\xc2\xa0 And of course, he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit tomorrow -- the President will talk at length tomorrow about our political support for individual rights and democracy in the region and a broad range of U.S. tools that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be bringing to bear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what we wanted to make sure we are doing, again, is reorienting a number of tools of U.S. power in the region -- diplomatic, political, economic, and otherwise -- to reinforce those nations that take the important step of transitioning to democracy; to show that the international community and the United States will support those transitions; to provide real resources that can make a difference while also encouraging the type of reforms that we know are essential to both stable economic growth and democratic development.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that this is a very comprehensive and important way to reinforce democratic change.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to look to build upon that progress in Egypt and Tunisia and those other countries that undertake reform in the years to come.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The only thing I would add is that in the transition of Central and Eastern Europe, the prospect of accession and membership in the EU was a powerful force for encouraging domestic efforts to reform their economies and stay on the right path.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important the vision that the President will be laying out tomorrow and then working -- will be substantive discussion in the days and weeks to come -- is about laying out a vision for what this region can achieve in terms of private sector development, job creation, integration among themselves, integration with the world economy, and backing up that vision with very specific steps, as my colleague laid out, that supported on that path.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, it is an important step and it may take a number of years to achieve that overall vision, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an important vision to keep in mind.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is related to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I am just wondering that the whole package may be not satisfied through the Egyptian public opinion because of the Egyptian public are waiting for the U.S. as a strategic and as a country with a deep relationship to move further with a real package, including -- that includes cancellation of the whole debt.\xc2\xa0 How do you react to this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I would say that, again, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that we\xe2\x80\x99re embracing a profound shift and a partnership with Egypt, and we see Egypt really as -- together with Tunisia -- the beacon in this region.\xc2\xa0 And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re laying out is a profound multiyear set of engagements with the Egyptian people to help support them.\xc2\xa0 At the end of the day, of course, the future is in their hands, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is support them here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Egypt has I think a very good prospect of accessing private capital markets, and that\xe2\x80\x99s important to Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s future economic vibrancy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we know economic leaders in Egypt want to reinforce.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here is supporting Egypt by making a very important commitment to debt relief, while also making sure that Egypt remains very attractive in the financial markets and an increasingly attractive destination for private investment by engaging the private sector.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve done these elements in a carefully crafted way to both show how deeply and profoundly the American people support Egyptian people, but also to reinforce the strength of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s economy as it grows and attracts private capital into the future to create those jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you doing this call.\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 On the cancellation of the debt, I thought I heard you say a figure of about $1 billion.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, the multilateral institution funding, I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s already pretty much been announced -- the World Bank talking about a $2-plus billion and IMF helping out on the funding cap for Egypt and Tunisia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard there\xe2\x80\x99s talk about boosting resources for EBRD.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about the money there?\xc2\xa0 And then just secondly, while it\xe2\x80\x99s not officially on the agenda, European officials have clearly said that the IMF leadership succession will be talked among leaders, G8 leaders upcoming.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the U.S. has -- can make clear whether they\xe2\x80\x99re supporting a merit-based leadership process, or will it back another European?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just quickly talk about the multilateral development banks piece.\xc2\xa0 The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the IMF, are all working hard together to address Egypt and Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s immediate financing needs that are associated with recovery and medium-term economic reform needs, which are going to create a much more vibrant private sector with much more jobs, rich kind of economy.\xc2\xa0 And the amounts there have not fully been finalized, but they will run in the multiple-billion-dollar-over-several-years scale.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, there what we\xe2\x80\x99re really proposing is a reorientation of the mandate of that institution so that it can play the same role in the Middle East and North Africa with countries that are making that democratic transition that it has played so successfully in Central and Eastern Europe, in particular in creating a much more robust private sector.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the IMF, why don\'t we leave that for a separate conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I just have a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Just to understand the cancellation of debt relief for making the swap with the debt, over what period of time is that?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to mean instead of making the debt repayments they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be going into direct investments into Europe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, if I can ask, are all the announcements that are going to be made tomorrow directed at Egypt and Tunisia, or is there going to be more detail about the integration for Arab states?\xc2\xa0 For example, FTAs or other possibilities?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t I just speak briefly on the debt swap and then turn it back over to my other colleague to talk about the trade and investment approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with regard to the debt relief, that is -- that will be a two-to-three-year process.\xc2\xa0 And those funds, of course, will become immediately available.\xc2\xa0 The funds that are no longer needed for servicing the debts are funds that the Egyptian government will then be able to use -- local currency, of course -- to invest in priority sectors that we and they believe are likely to center in areas such as youth employment and entrepreneurship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 On the trade and investment front, what we envisage is a step-by-step initiative initially focused on facilitating more robust trade within the region, building on existing agreements.\xc2\xa0 We have a number of agreements there, as does the EU, to further promote integration with the U.S. and European markets, and then ultimately working with countries in the region who have achieved a high level of reform and trade liberalization on the possibility of a regional trade arrangement.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a multi-stage process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, I wanted to ask if the purpose of these moves with respect to Egypt and Tunisia is to act as a carrot of sorts to encourage other countries to move forward with their democratic reforms in the hope of getting these sorts of benefits?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the same vein, if that is the hope, how do we justify, for example, continuing to give substantial assistance to Jordan when the evidence of substantial political reform there is lacking?\xc2\xa0 If countries that haven\xe2\x80\x99t shown reforms are still going to get substantial aid, then is there really any linkage to the reforms?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if our first colleague wants to take that one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 What was the question again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Hey, why don\'t you handle part two?\xc2\xa0 We just had to jump back on.\xc2\xa0 The plane landed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we very much do look at, as my other colleague said, as Tunisia and Egypt being at the leading edge of potential reformers in the region, as potential demonstration cases for the rest of the region.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, we do see their success as a positive incentive for others in the region who are also working on the reform agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d just add to that, we believe that Egypt and Tunisia are hugely important for a number of reasons.\xc2\xa0 First of all, Tunisia was just a vanguard of the democratic movements that had swept across the region.\xc2\xa0 And Egypt is the largest Arab country, of course, and an important bellwether for the region as well.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that we know about what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in the Middle East and North Africa is that change is going to be different in every country.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, there are going be very difficult circumstances where change is contested and transitions are more difficult.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so one of the most important things that we can do, in addition to supporting political and economic reform in all countries and individual rights as well, is empowering a positive model, and that if Tunisia and Egypt are able to be successful in their transitions, able to solidify their democratic gains, and able to reinforce those gains through economic development, then that provides a powerful incentive for the nations and peoples of the other regions to pursue similar reforms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So part of the purpose of this economic program, again, is to reinforce not only positive change in Egypt and Tunisia, but a positive model that can empower and incentivize democratic change and economic reform in other parts of the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand the broader context for all this -- for this briefing -- because you said this would deal with a portion of the speech, and you seem to be discussing only, or primarily, certainly, Egypt and Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how -- if you can outline or give a general sense of what other portions the speech falls into, and how -- beyond the discussion of trade briefly there -- how any of these economic proposals affect Bahrain, Yemen, Syria, any of the other countries that are in the region beyond Egypt and Tunisia, or is this just about those two countries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first part, and then I think my colleague should address the trade portion of the question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the speech addresses a broad context.\xc2\xa0 It will speak to the political change in the region.\xc2\xa0 It will speak to efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking to support human rights and democratic reform in the region and a broader interest in peace and security in the region.\xc2\xa0 And the President, of course, will be speaking in length about that tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just not previewing those particular portions today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But however, with regard to your question, I would reinforce one of the things that I was just saying, which is that when you have a region of many different countries that are pursuing change in their own different pace, part of what we do is going to be using our influence in support of positive outcomes in different countries.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps even more important, given the fact that ultimately change is not going to be determined by the United States, change is going to be determined by the people of the region, but one of the most important things that we can do is empower positive models of change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Already -- and frankly, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen that in events, because the protests that began in Tunisia spread to other parts of the Middle East and North Africa, and Tunisia and Egypt have been at the forefront of this.\xc2\xa0 And again, they are all particularly important given Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s role, for instance, as the largest Arab nation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is entirely relevant to the other nations in the region and the other transitions taking place in the region to have a positive model of democratic transition and economic development in Tunisia and Egypt that would have a positive impact beyond their borders, because as my colleague said, it incentivizes -- as we learned in previous transitions -- nations are more likely to undertake positive actions if they see incentives for those actions, and that one of the clearest ways to provide those incentives is to see a positive model.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to my colleague on the trade question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think on the trade question, the vision is one in which the countries are -- where protectionism gives way to openness, where the countries are further integrated amongst themselves and with the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And one might start with Tunisia and Egypt, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a vision that other countries can certainly participate in and join in as they pursue economic reforms as well.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s broader than Egypt and Tunisia as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think the examples that were discussed earlier -- if you go back to the post-war engagement of the U.S. and Europe, if you go back to the transitions in Central to Eastern Europe -- in each case, we were crafting institutions that were really designed to provide positive reinforcement to those countries who were kind of moving in the right direction politically as much as economically.\xc2\xa0 So if you look at the reorientation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, that\xe2\x80\x99s again -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of signal that as countries take these quite ambitious and bold steps, that the international community and the U.S. in particular will be there to help support those transitions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question about the level of communication between the American administration and the government both in Tunisia and Egypt -- concerning those financial initiatives, did you speak before with the governments in both countries and on what level?\xc2\xa0 Did you speak with the Supreme Military Council or the government?\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a word and maybe one of my colleagues wants to join in as well.\xc2\xa0 There have been meetings and visits in the region by officials from the Treasury Department, the State Department, the White House on the economic issues as well as an important meeting around the World Bank-IMF spring meetings on this issue as well.\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s been multiple contacts in each of the countries as we have been working on this economic program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99d just add one thing.\xc2\xa0 In addition to those consultations, I think just generally at a variety of levels, both governmental and nongovernmental, to include conversations with civil society and nongovernment actors, one of the important messages that we hear from Egypt and Tunisia was how\xc2\xa0 important economic growth and support for economic development would be to the current situation in Egypt and Tunisia, both in part because they did suffer some shocks around the recent upheaval in their countries, but also because as we look to ways in which, again, the United States can use our policy tools to support change, we can obviously do a range of things that speak up for and stand up for the things that we believe in and the rights that we support.\xc2\xa0 And the President will speak to that tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But one of the concrete ways that we can demonstrate our support for democratic changes is through this type of economic program.\xc2\xa0 And so this is fully in line with many of the contacts we\xe2\x80\x99ve had both in the official\xc2\xa0 consultations but also in the types of messages that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from within the government and from within civil society as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everybody, for jumping on.\xc2\xa0 And as we said before, the embargo is 9:00 p.m. tonight.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll work on getting you any information we can that would be helpful between now and then in terms of fact sheets, et cetera, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:47 P.M.
