EST</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have a special guest.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We do have a special guest -- our Domestic Policy Council Director, Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked to come back to help answer any nuts-and-bolts questions on immigration.</p>\n<p>Before we turn to Cecilia, who has spent I believe over two decades working to achieve immigration reform in Washington -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re very proud and lucky that she was part of this, she helped lead this effort that the President announced last night -- before we do that, I just want to do two quick things.</p>\n<p>One is, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that we have a letter that was written by 10 legal scholars from across the ideological spectrum supporting what the President did last night as legally sound, and writing that it is within the power of the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 I actually have copies of that letter for you on this three-hour flight.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99ll be some nice reading material.</p>\n<p>I also want to draw your attention to the analysis released by the Council of Economic Advisers earlier this morning, which found that the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions would boost economic output by an estimated .4 to .9 percent over 10 years, or increases in GDP of about $90 to $210 billion in 2014.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of other good economic analysis in that report that I would draw your attention to, but for now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President include the parents of DREAMers for deferred action?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll find in the Office of Legal Counsel analysis that that question was asked and answered.\xc2\xa0 The basis for the legal analysis was that Congress determined that some people in the United States -- U.S. citizens as adults -- can petition for visas to bring in their parents as immigrants.\xc2\xa0 And so Congress has spoken to the issue of family reunification for people who are U.S. citizen adults.</p>\n<p>And so on that basis, there is a legal rationale for providing relief, because, ultimately, these people are going to be immigrants as determined by Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not true, categorically, with respect to people who are parents of DACA recipients.\xc2\xa0 DACA recipients don\xe2\x80\x99t -- as DACA recipients, don\xe2\x80\x99t have the capacity to bring in their parents as immigrants, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they ended up on the other side of the legal line.</p>\n<p>But we asked that question and OLC answered it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you make of Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s reaction in which he said that the President has damaged the presidency by doing what he did yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would draw you to a wealth of precedent dating back to President Eisenhower, and the legal underpinnings of our argument, which show this is well within the bounds of the executive authority of the President, again, very similar to plans implemented by presidents before him, including President Reagan, President H.W. Bush, who expanded a program to account for about 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time, which is very similar to what the President announced last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Republicans have followed through on their suit on ACA.\xc2\xa0 What is the response on that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw that.\xc2\xa0 We find that unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 At a time where we -- I think the American people want Washington focused on jobs and the economy, the House Republicans choose to sue us, sue the President for doing his job -- and using taxpayer resources at the same time -- for a lawsuit that their own congressional research service could not identify any merit for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cecilia, can I just ask, a lot of people that are allies of the President are hailing what he did as a real victory.\xc2\xa0 But how disappointed are you that folks that feel like that essentially gave up too early on the idea of legislation?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that this is sort of a half measure that makes it a lot harder, ultimately, down the road to get where you all really wanted to get?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 The President made clear last night that this is a step.\xc2\xa0 We see it -- he sees it as only a step, and there has to be a next step.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot of unfinished business on the immigration reform agenda.\xc2\xa0 While this accomplishes a great deal, it does not fix everything that\xe2\x80\x99s broken -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the legal authority to fix everything that\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99 job, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to make his best effort to work with the Congress to pass an immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The country still needs that to be done.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of unfinished business that needs to be done, and that continues to be very high on his agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The likelihood of that -- is it more likely or less likely today than it would have been before?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 On some level, that\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Congress.\xc2\xa0 The need for immigration reform is, today, the same as it was yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The economic benefits of immigration reform, which are enormous, are the same today as they were yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason the sense of urgency should be any different today than it was yesterday.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work still to be done, and that\xe2\x80\x99s for Congress to do.\xc2\xa0 And the President is eager to work with them to do it.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d just add that nobody is more interested in getting a comprehensive immigration reform bill out of the United States Congress than the President.\xc2\xa0 And I would note, when Speaker Boehner was asked a few days after the election if he would commit to bringing up such a bill, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of a top-line number for the number of people eligible under the plan, there have been pretty big disparities in the news reporting.\xc2\xa0 What would you consider the top-line number?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 These are all estimates, but it\xe2\x80\x99s roughly -- when you look at all of the various pieces, including the deferred action components as well as the pieces affecting the legal immigration system, it\xe2\x80\x99s roughly in the neighborhood of 5 million, or just south of 5 million.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that including the previous DACA folks?\xc2\xa0 Is that added in?</p>\n<p>MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 Not in that particular estimate that I just gave.\xc2\xa0 But again, these are all estimates.\xc2\xa0 It is a difficult business to calculate numbers for a population which by definition has been living in hiding.\xc2\xa0 So everybody\xe2\x80\x99s figures are rough figures.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office has pointed out that the call to pass a bill might not -- might be kind of limiting.\xc2\xa0 I mean, President Obama is not going to sign a bill that goes against everything he believes in, and so it seems like maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s some truth to that; that saying \xe2\x80\x9cpass a bill,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s some boundary on what kind of bill he would sign.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, what is that boundary of what he would sign?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the guidance beyond addressing these big problems?\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the limit?\xc2\xa0 If House Republicans and Senate Republicans pass a bill that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like at all, where does he draw the line?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 Every immigration reform bill since at least the 1965 act has been a strongly bipartisan bill.\xc2\xa0 In order to get immigration reform done, you need collaboration between both parties, just like we saw in the U.S. Senate a year and a half ago.</p>\n<p>So it is entirely possible to have a bipartisan conversation that produces a bill that the President of the United States can sign.\xc2\xa0 The Senate of the United States did that in June of 2013.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that this Congress or the next Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t do the same.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think one good starting point would be that the Senate passed a bill where Democrats, Republicans and independents all came together.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, the bill is not perfect.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the one he would draft.\xc2\xa0 But it is one that brings together a lot of common-sense reforms that got bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that need to be the guideline?\xc2\xa0 The Senate passed a bill -- does that need to be the guideline for anything the Republican Congress takes?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We said we are willing to roll up our sleeves, work with the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 If they have other ideas, they should bring them to the table.\xc2\xa0 Again, we are very eager to work with them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he still going to do piece by piece?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to have a bipartisan conversation that results in fixing the immigration reform system.\xc2\xa0 So nothing has changed about where he has been and where he wants to go on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to Las Vegas.\xc2\xa0 Talk a little bit about -- I mean, this seems like a real political trip that highlights the fact that this is a state with a lot of voters that are Hispanics, et cetera, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Was that the thinking in coming here?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you were on the trip two years ago.\xc2\xa0 I was not.\xc2\xa0 But that was --</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 I was.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the last time I gaggled, actually.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That was the first trip of the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term, and he went to Del Sol High School to lay out his principles for common-sense immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Again, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- he laid out those principles and started to work with the Senate on bringing together some bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>After months of hard work, rolling up their sleeves, Democrats, independents, Republicans came together.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the House of Representatives did not act and could not get that done.\xc2\xa0 So the President, after waiting 500 days for Congress to do it, decided to take action last night.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s returning to that high school this afternoon to talk about the actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, other than the symmetry of coming back to the same place, is there a reason why Las Vegas and this area in particular would have been the choice then and is the choice now?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 I think -- first of all, symmetry is a pretty nice idea.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people remember that moment -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the moment that launched the Senate debate which succeeded in producing a bipartisan bill.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, look, this is an issue which affects all kinds of parts of the country and all kinds of different kinds of communities.\xc2\xa0 But part of the point here is that this is an effort that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for years.\xc2\xa0 The President has been working very hard to try to get Congress to come forward and do its job.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, we were in this same place, launching an effort that succeeded in producing bipartisan legislation -- he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to highlight that.\xc2\xa0 That is still possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline for implementation?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 So there are lots of different pieces to this.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re probably thinking specifically of the new deferred action program, but if you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would take some other things, too.</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 If you look at the DACA program that we announced in June of 2012, DHS started accepting applications a couple months later.\xc2\xa0 That was for a program that had roughly in the neighborhood of a million potential eligible applicants.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a lot bigger than that, so you can expect DHS to take a few months to stand up the implementation, but we expect them to be ready to accept applications by spring.</p>\n<p>And for the extension of the existing DACA program, it will probably be sooner than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the program is by definition temporary, is there any concern about whether people will be hesitant to participate, given that they\xe2\x80\x99re effectively creating a registry of illegal immigrants?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the same question we were asked about DACA, and 700,000 people later, I think that question, at least for that program, has an answer.</p>\n<p>A lot depends on the quality of the outreach, the quality of the information that the government is able to provide to people.\xc2\xa0 We learned a lot from the DACA experience, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 percent of the people eligible for DACA have come forward, and we would hope that that would be true the next time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there some paperwork that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be signing today?\xc2\xa0 And what exactly is that?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 So there are a couple of pieces, but understand that most of these actions do not involve a thing for him to sign.</p>\n<p>But there are two presidential memoranda.\xc2\xa0 The first creates a task force on new -- a White House task force on new Americans, which is an interagency task force that will look at the integration of immigrants and make sure that the whole federal apparatus is engaged in making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re effectively integrating new Americans, people who have just become citizens.\xc2\xa0 The second is a presidential memorandum setting up an interagency group on visa modernization.</p>\n<p>So there are number of ways, still, that we think can be dug into to look at the way the visa allocation process happens.\xc2\xa0 We learned, for example, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t always allocate the right number of visas for processing that are actually available under the law.\xc2\xa0 There may be ways to streamline that process so that we effectively use every visa made available under the law.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one example of the kinds of issues that this group that\xe2\x80\x99s going to work on visa modernization will look at.</p>\n<p>The task force on new Americans will be reporting back to the President I think in *90 120 days, and the visa modernization group in 120.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 But I do think -- the President announced last night can be done by just redirecting the bureaucracy at the administrative level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign those at the school?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll sign those today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when we have an update on the timing.</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 And just to refer you back to DACA, there was nothing to sign when we did that process, and this is similar to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How healthy of a debate was there among the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior advisors and in communication with OLC over what you could do?\xc2\xa0 Did some people want to go farther?\xc2\xa0 Did some people say, maybe we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 What the President asked his team -- as to how far he could go under the law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the process has produced.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 And I will say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually be fairly forthcoming in laying out a few areas that were considered that weren\xe2\x80\x99t supported, ultimately, by the law, based on the legal advice we got from the Office of Legal Counsel.\xc2\xa0 So I actually think it buttresses the argument that we were staying within the bounds of the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you read out the members that are on this plane right now?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re joined by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senator Bob Menendez, Representative Becerra, Representative Gutierrez, Representative Horsford, Representative Lujan, and Representative Titus.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also joined by a few folks who have spent years working on immigration reform -- Arturo Rodriguez, President of the United Farm Workers; Marc Muriel, President of the National Urban League, and a few other folks we will get you -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the full list.</p>\n<p>I also have a week ahead if that\xe2\x80\x99s of any interest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you able to say -- the trip to India.\xc2\xa0 Is he adding any more countries to that trip?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- any announcements that will bookend that travel yet.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s all still being worked out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On India.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 India, any more countries.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So next week.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will present 19 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest civilian honor.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will join the President at this event.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will travel to Chicago, Illinois to meet with community leaders and discuss the executive actions he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to fix our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 There, the President looks forward to speaking to a diverse group of leaders in his hometown on Tuesday, and to continue discussing the actions he took with communities and Americans across the country.\xc2\xa0 Following those events, the President will return to Washington, D.C., and remain overnight at the White House.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday -- my favorite event of the year -- we will pardon the presidential turkey.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will celebrate Thanksgiving at the White House with his family.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no public events scheduled.\xc2\xa0 And on Friday, there\xe2\x80\x99s no public events scheduled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the turkey from?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 We will have to find that out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, do you have any sort of update on Iran and the negotiations there?\xc2\xa0 And are you -- is it heading toward another extension?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are pressing hard.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry, as you know, was in Vienna meeting with Iranian and international counterparts to determine if he can close the remaining gaps.\xc2\xa0 We are running against the clock; obviously, the deadline is Monday, and people are -- our folks there are working furiously to meet it.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be frank, though, some gaps do remain.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say he\xe2\x80\x99s returning to Vienna?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No, no, he was in Vienna.\xc2\xa0 I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s now in Paris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were on a roll.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you really were on a roll.\xc2\xa0 Can you go back?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were being frank.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always good, right, and candid.\xc2\xa0 Serious gaps do remain, and throughout the negotiations, the P5-plus-1 have put forth proposals that are consistent with our core objectives and consistent with Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s expressed desire for a viable civilian nuclear program.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that we won\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President has been clear we won\xe2\x80\x99t take a bad deal.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work against the clock.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re only going to approve a deal that effectively cuts off all pathways to a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s -- extension then.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to race against the clock to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it was the same thing -- but if it got to a point where you\xe2\x80\x99re close, would you extend it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re racing against the clock to get this done.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:51 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
