Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:03 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0I do not have any remarks at the top so we can go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tDarlene, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I predicted you\xe2\x80\x99d call on her first. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He predicted you\xe2\x80\x99d call on me first. \xc2\xa0What more can you tell us about the meeting the President had with the leaders from Congress over the Supreme Court? \xc2\xa0Senator Reid said that a lot of time was spent talking about basketball and other stuff-- (laughter) -- and he said the meeting didn\xe2\x80\x99t last very long. \xc2\xa0How long did it last? \xc2\xa0Is he accurate? \xc2\xa0Was there any substance discussed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a sense of exactly how long it lasted. \xc2\xa0We can look into that for you. \xc2\xa0I did have an opportunity to visit with the President after the meeting concluded, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of this situation is that any President has a responsibility to consult intensively with Congress before making a nomination to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And when the two previous vacancies have arisen during his vacancy, the President, after a couple of weeks, invited the chair and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate to come and have a discussion about the process, about the way the President was thinking about whom to choose for this important appointment, and the President felt it was important, even in an election year, to continue that consultation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the meeting was pretty straightforward. \xc2\xa0No one represented that he was about to change his position on something. \xc2\xa0But the President did use the opportunity to lay out his thinking, and he gave everyone in the room -- Democrats and Republicans -- the opportunity to put forward their own suggestions for potential Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that he would choose that person, but the President did indicate that he would take seriously any recommendations that either Democrats or Republicans had to put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a group in the Oval Office that, collectively, maybe even has a century of experience of considering Supreme Court nominees and confirming them -- that when you sort of add up everybody\xe2\x80\x99s role here, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of history. \xc2\xa0In fact, that history dates back to 1988, the last time that the United States Senate voted to confirm a Supreme Court nominee, and both Senators McConnell and Grassley supported Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. \xc2\xa0And Vice President Biden presided over that process as chair of the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we certainly know how this process has worked in recent history. \xc2\xa0We know how it worked the last time that this situation occurred -- that the President of the United States was asking a Senate that was led by the other party to confirm a nominee in an election year. \xc2\xa0And that resulted in Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming confirmation with bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0And we believe that this process should conclude the same way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned that the President gave both sides an opportunity to suggest names. \xc2\xa0Were any names suggested from either side? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the individual senators read out their sides of the meeting. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the offer was not a one-time-only offer, that if there are individuals members of the Senate who, after a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep, wake up tomorrow morning with a good suggestion and a desire to genuinely engage in the process, then they certainly know how to reach the White House and they know how to get the President on the phone. \xc2\xa0And if they want to come back down to the Oval Office and talk about it in person, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we could arrange another meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is serious about this consultation, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Republicans engage in it seriously, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you have a vacancy on the Court. \xc2\xa0The President came out and said he\xe2\x80\x99s going to nominate. \xc2\xa0Republicans said, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do anything. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve now had this meeting today. \xc2\xa0What is the next move in this process, and who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for making it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The next move would be for Republicans to avail themselves of the opportunity to continue consulting with the President. \xc2\xa0If they choose to do so, they will have that opportunity, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity that will endure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the President and his team will continue with the process that has been running here at the White House now for more than a week for the President to consider the background and record of potential Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0And the President will continue to do that work with the goal of eventually putting forward a nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about one other thing that happened yesterday -- late yesterday after the briefing. \xc2\xa0A magistrate judge in New York City ruled that the Justice Department cannot force Apple to provide the FBI with access to data on an iPhone in a drug case in New York City. \xc2\xa0Is there any reaction from the White House to that judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, and any concerns about how it might influence the bigger debate that\xe2\x80\x99s going on between DOJ [sic] and the Justice Department over the San Bernardino --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a reaction to the ruling in that specific case. \xc2\xa0I\'ve obviously read the public reports about it, but I don\'t have a detailed knowledge of the facts of the case. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve made quite clear that the discussion that we\'ve been having about the San Bernardino case applies specifically to this scenario where a terrorist who is no longer living was using a phone that was owned by the local government, and in pursuit of their independent investigation, law enforcement professionals have concluded that information that may be contained in that phone could be useful for their investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the President has made clear that the investigation is a priority because we want to learn as much as we possibly can about the individuals who carried out this terrorist attack. \xc2\xa0We want to learn as much as we possibly can about people that they may have been talking to or communicating with here in the United States or around the world. \xc2\xa0We also want to learn as much as we possibly can about what may have prompted them to carry out these terrible attacks that resulted in the death of 14 innocent patriotic Americans and caused the injury of a couple dozen others.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ve been clear about what our interest is in this specific case. \xc2\xa0As a legal matter, my understanding is -- you should confirm this with the Department of Justice -- is that as a legal matter, there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- that this ruling in New York does not have any impact on the ongoing situation in San Bernardino. \xc2\xa0But that\'s essentially our position.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Going back to the Supreme Court, a quick question. \xc2\xa0Did President Obama put forward any names that he might be considering during this meeting? \xc2\xa0And then also, I guess to the larger point, President Obama has said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that the position that the Republicans are taking that they won\'t hold any hearings, they won\'t take any vote, that that won\'t be sustained, that they won\'t be able to necessarily hold on to that position. \xc2\xa0And I guess the idea is that they\xe2\x80\x99ll face so much public pressure that they will have to back down. \xc2\xa0I guess, does the White House still feel that public pressure is going to be such that McConnell and Grassley will have to back down? \xc2\xa0And what provides that confidence? \xc2\xa0And seemingly, is that the only option that you guys have, is public pressure to make them back down from their position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ayesha, I don\'t have a more detailed readout than I\'ve shared this far. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know whether or not the President put forward any potential nominees in the context of that discussion. \xc2\xa0But even if he did, I probably wouldn\'t be in a position to float those names here publicly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore generally, our intent is to continue to fulfill the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibilities. \xc2\xa0The Constitution of the United States says that the President of the United States shall appoint someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0The President is going to fulfill that responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States Senate also has a constitutional responsibility when it comes to vacancies on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0They have a responsibility to provide their advice and consent to the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say that members of the Senate should consider a nominee based on whether or not that person was at the top of their list of potential Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0The Supreme Court suggested they should consider their background and their record -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the Constitution suggested they should consider their background and record to determine whether or not they could serve on the Supreme Court with -- in a way that lives up to the American people\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when it comes to our strategy, our strategy is simply that the President will fulfill his constitutional responsibility and we\'re going to appeal to members of the United States Senate that they should put their constitutional responsibility ahead of any sort of political calculation that their party leaders may be making.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s a hope that they will just adhere to what you feel is a constitutional responsibility? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no plan to do anything beyond that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than my hope. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s what it says in the Constitution. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also consistent with past precedent. \xc2\xa0The last time that there was a President of the United States that was challenging the -- calling on the United States Senate to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in an election year, it was 1988. \xc2\xa0You had a Republican House; Democrats were in charge of the Senate. \xc2\xa0And Justice Kennedy was confirmed with overwhelming Democratic support to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so there is recent precedent to consult. \xc2\xa0There certainly is the United States Constitution to consult. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s clear exactly what the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities are. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Democrats that they intend to fulfill their responsibilities. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s up in the air about whether or not Republicans will follow through on their threat not to engage in their constitutional duties, not to fulfill those duties.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to decide their own course. \xc2\xa0I don\'t expect that they\'re going to change their minds just because I said so. \xc2\xa0They made clear in the meeting with the President that they\'re not going to change their mind just because the President says so. \xc2\xa0Rather, they will change their mind, if they do, based on an appeal to their constitutional duties. \xc2\xa0And that\'s certainly the appeal that we\'re making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On North Korea, the U.N. is supposed to be taking up a vote on those sanctions that the U.S. and China have agreed to. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any concerns about the vote, or any expectations about the vote? \xc2\xa0And then also, when you talk about these sanctions -- I know you\'ve talked about them before -- but what is it about these sanctions that you think will kind of rein in North Korea where other sanctions have not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0These are all good questions. \xc2\xa0I got a short briefing on where things stand in the process. \xc2\xa0My understanding is that the United States has put forward a formal request -- or yesterday put forward a formal request for a Security Council vote on a draft sanctions resolution. \xc2\xa0The United States yesterday called for that vote to take place today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a part of -- sort of a matter of routine, any member of the Council can request a 24-hour review, meaning they can essentially say, let\xe2\x80\x99s wait 24 hours, postpone the vote for 24 hours, so that we can get a chance to review the resolution. \xc2\xa0That\'s what the Russians did yesterday. \xc2\xa0So at this point, the Security Council appears to be on track for a vote on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, as it relates to the substance of the sanctions themselves, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, and as we discussed a little bit yesterday, this package of sanctions goes farther than previous packages have. \xc2\xa0And it goes farther in a variety of ways. \xc2\xa0One is it would ensure and require the inspection of all cargo going into and out of North Korea. \xc2\xa0For the first time, it would prohibit all small arms and other conventional weapons from being sold to the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt would, for the first time, impose broad sectoral sanctions on sectors, particular sectors of the North Korean economy such as it is. \xc2\xa0We know that the North Korean economy is not particularly advanced because of other sanctions that have been imposed on them. \xc2\xa0It means that they are particularly reliant on sectors like coal, iron, gold, titanium, and rare earth materials. \xc2\xa0Those are exactly the sectors of their economy that would subjected to these broader sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is important for two reasons. \xc2\xa0One is we know that the North Korean government uses revenue from these sectors of their economy to bankroll their nuclear and missile programs. \xc2\xa0So that certainly is one way that we can counter their destabilizing activities. \xc2\xa0The other thing that we know is that it\xe2\x80\x99s the North Korean ruling elite that benefits financially from these sectors. And imposing these sanctions will have an impact on the financial well-being of the North Korean elite. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWill that be enough to get them to start changing their behavior and change their strategic calculation? \xc2\xa0That remains to be seen, but certainly applying more pressure to the North Korean elite is one reasonable suggestion for trying to do that. \xc2\xa0We surely know that the North Korean people have suffered for far too long because of the decisions that were made by the North Korean government, that their pursuit of nuclear weapons and their willingness to isolate that country from the rest of the international community has had a devastating impact on the North Korean population. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this sanctions regime is targeted more specifically at the North Korean elite.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to take another crack at this Supreme Court issue in a different way. \xc2\xa0Since this is a constitutional issue, with the fact that the Republicans are refusing to meet the potential nominee and also have a hearing, what is the White House Counsel doing as it relates to this? \xc2\xa0How are they handling this matter?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Neil Eggleston is the President\xe2\x80\x99s counsel here at the White House. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s got a whole team of lawyers who are engaged in the process of providing the President information that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to his search for a Supreme Court nominee. \xc2\xa0As a part of this process, the President will consider and take a look at the public writings, the public record of individuals who could be Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of legwork involved, and lawyers here at the White House are involved in making sure that the President can have access to this information and that he has all the information that he needs in a timely fashion to make a decision about who is the best person to serve on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at that, tell me about how the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office is also looking at possible punishments or being penalized for not following the Constitution? \xc2\xa0Because I asked Harry Reid, Senator Harry Reid, if the Constitution isn\xe2\x80\x99t followed, what next? \xc2\xa0He said, you know, the American people will vote. \xc2\xa0But what is the White House finding that could be possible punishment or a way to get around this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, again, as I mentioned to Ayesha, our case to Senate Republicans is that they should allow their constitutional responsibilities to supersede their political calculations. \xc2\xa0In effect, they should do what the Constitution tells them to do, not what party leaders tell them to do. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making to them, and that is consistent with the reading -- with anybody\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Constitution. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with past precedent. \xc2\xa0After all, every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has gotten either a hearing or a vote -- unless, of course, the President withdrew that nominee. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why it would be unprecedented for President Obama to put someone forward and have Republicans refuse to meet with that person, refuse to host that person for a courtesy visit, to refuse to hold hearings. \xc2\xa0All that would fly in the face of decades of tradition. \xc2\xa0Most importantly, it would fly in the face of their constitutional responsibilities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Remembering that a couple of months, maybe a year or so ago, we were hearing on the Hill about possibilities of a lawsuit against the President from Republicans to the President for his appointments. \xc2\xa0Now, in some of the things that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve filed so many lawsuits it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to keep track.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And with that, is this administration -- is the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office looking at possible litigation when it comes to this issue, the Constitution not being followed? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any work in that regard. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, frankly, if that\xe2\x80\x99s even an option.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to be clear -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear everyone\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities here, but is the President still optimistic that Republicans will ultimately have a change of heart and consider his nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President is realistic that there are a lot of politics being played here right now. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a presidential election year, so that\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly surprising to anybody who works in this building. \xc2\xa0The question I think really is about -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s an open one -- about whether or not Republicans will put their constitutional duties ahead of their political calculations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what the Constitution says they should do. \xc2\xa0If they want to consider precedent, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what they should do. \xc2\xa0If they want to consider what can be done to protect the long-term health of the Supreme Court, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what they should do. \xc2\xa0Because what they are promising to do right now would, in an unprecedented way, escalate the degree to which the Supreme Court is imbued with partisan politics. \xc2\xa0And the truth is, the framers of our Constitution designed a system that would insulate the Supreme Court from those kinds of politics to a large degree. \xc2\xa0And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that kind of escalation is in the best interests of the republic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on another topic, a member of the Secret Service yesterday got into quite a physical altercation with a Time photographer at a Trump rally, grabbing his neck, slamming him into the ground. \xc2\xa0Are you aware of this incident? \xc2\xa0And do you feel this response was appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the footage and obviously the news coverage of this incident. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed on the details, and I know that the Secret Service and local law enforcement are working to learn more about what exactly transpired there.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think what I can say just generally is that all of us on a regular basis benefit from the courage and professionalism of the men and women of the Secret Service. \xc2\xa0After all, they keep us safe. \xc2\xa0They certainly keep the President safe. \xc2\xa0They protect our workplace. \xc2\xa0And we all benefit from the professional way that they do their jobs day in and day out. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of attention, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay because that\xe2\x80\x99s their responsibility. \xc2\xa0They hold themselves to an extraordinarily high standard. \xc2\xa0We certainly hold them to a high standard. \xc2\xa0And far more often than not, the men and women of the Secret Service live up to that standard. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly grateful for their service for that reason. \xc2\xa0But I know that the Secret Service has also indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at this particular situation and they\xe2\x80\x99ll take appropriate action once the facts have been gathered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess more broadly on this, there seems to be a big difference between how the press is treated here and at the President\xe2\x80\x99s events versus on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0I mean, at Trump events, the press is forced to stay physically in a pen. \xc2\xa0Are you at all concerned that First Amendment rights are being violated here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the privilege of attending a campaign event hosted by the Trump campaign. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I understand they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty entertaining.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, each campaign will have to sort of make their own decisions about how they want to handle press access to their events. \xc2\xa0Generally, my limited experience in campaigns is that the reason that you hold public events is so the public can have an opportunity to be informed about your message and what\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed, and an important part of that is not just inviting a big crowd, but also inviting the news media to capture what happens so that that can be -- so people can be educated about what happens.</p>\n<p>\n\tI understand the need to keep order. \xc2\xa0But I also understand that most candidates are pretty proud of the people who are showing up at their events and they\'re eager for those who are attending the event to actually talk to the news media and talk about why they\'re attending that event and why they\'re supporting that candidate. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why a candidate might be embarrassed by his or her supporters, or embarrassed by who might be attending his event. \xc2\xa0But you should check with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So aside from the basketball talk, it sounds like this meeting went pretty poorly, or maybe horribly is a better word.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that at all. \xc2\xa0Again, I think the meeting was actually pretty straightforward. \xc2\xa0No one represented that they were on the verge of changing their opinion. \xc2\xa0But the President takes quite seriously the responsibility that he has to consult with members of Congress in both parties as he makes a really important decision. \xc2\xa0The Constitution vests with the President of the United States the authority -- in fact, the Constitution says the President shall appoint a nominee to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s his responsibility to work with the legislative branch to do that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why the White House has contacted the office of every single member that serves on the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0I also feel like it merits pointing out this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time that the President has talked to Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley about this vacancy. \xc2\xa0In fact, this is the second time in just a couple of weeks that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had this conversation. \xc2\xa0And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional conversations. \xc2\xa0And in fact, if Leader McConnell or Chairman Grassley want to have an additional conversation or more conversations, particularly with regard to potential nominees, we\'re open to those conversations, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is part of the process. \xc2\xa0Just to go more directly to your question, though, Michelle, we certainly would have liked Republicans to have handled the meeting differently. \xc2\xa0We certainly would welcome greater engagement on the part of Republicans, a greater, clearer willingness to put their constitutional duties first, at the top of their list of priorities, and resist the urge to allow this process to be so deeply infected and corrupted by partisan political gamesmanship. That doesn\'t advance the process.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this is we know that both Chairman Grassley and Leader McConnell have decades of experience of handling Supreme Court nominees and Supreme Court confirmations, so they understand the role that the Senate has to play in this process. \xc2\xa0They also understand how important it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from them on a number of occasions. \xc2\xa0Over the course of the last seven years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those two men speak publicly about a range of Supreme Court decisions -- some they agreed with, some they vigorously disagreed with. \xc2\xa0But all of them -- in each situation both men understood the stakes here. \xc2\xa0They also understand that it would be unprecedented for the modern Supreme Court to go for more than a year with a vacancy waiting to be filled. \xc2\xa0So they understand the stakes. \xc2\xa0They understand the situation. \xc2\xa0They understand the debates, and they certainly understand what happened last time the Congress was asked to vote on a Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. \xc2\xa0In fact, they both voted yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given that they were so adamant going into this meeting -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve both written more than one op-ed stating their case, Senators Reid and Leahy seemed pretty frustrated coming out of there -- did the President think that he was going to change their minds? \xc2\xa0Or was this --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, the President did not -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal in the context of this discussion was to continue to consult the United States Senate about who should fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that that consultation is important. It\xe2\x80\x99s a priority for him. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a priority for him the last two times that he has had fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to him this time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But in this case, it seems pretty perfunctory, though, given that the two Republicans he\xe2\x80\x99s consulting with are absolutely adamant and have been.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, that is a choice that\'s made by Republicans. \xc2\xa0The President came to the meeting and showed up today with the intent to have a serious conversation. \xc2\xa0And the President did lay out in some detail his thinking about how this process should play out. \xc2\xa0He laid out in some detail how he will -- how he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about who should be appointed to fill this vacancy. \xc2\xa0And he continues to welcome input from Democrats and Republicans on that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just point out, in 2009, the first time that the President had to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, the President took very seriously his responsibilities to consult with members of Congress, and Senator Grassley is quoted publicly saying that after serving in the United States Senate for decades, it was the very first time he could remember a United States President asking him for a suggestion about who should be nominated to serve on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So then-Senator Grassley I think said that as a compliment to Senator Obama. \xc2\xa0And, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he intended it that way -- you can ask him -- but the point is I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that Chairman Grassley understands how important this consultation is and he appreciates the fact that President Obama had reached out to him then. \xc2\xa0And the President was doing exactly the same thing today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold it important enough, obviously, to even bring this potential nominee up for hearings. \xc2\xa0But the President described Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 stance last week I think it was as \xe2\x80\x9csheepish\xe2\x80\x9d when he talked to them one on one in these phone conversations they had. \xc2\xa0Would he or you still describe then as sheepish, given this meeting that happened today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more detailed readout of the discussion than I had today. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that the President was necessarily talking about Leader McConnell or Chairman Grassley. \xc2\xa0He may have been; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0The reason we don\xe2\x80\x99t know that is because the President has actually had the opportunity to talk to a number of Republicans about the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t automatically assume that the President was referring either just to or included Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley in that comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And last week, when I asked you if you felt like there was -- given everything that\xe2\x80\x99s been said already, do you think that there is still a chance that this will make it to the hearing stage, you said \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Do you still feel that there is a chance of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear, based on what the Constitution says, based on recent precedent, based on the obligations that Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley are intimately familiar with. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to appeal to the notion that they have a constitutional duty to move forward. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s clear --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess I would say then why do you feel like these guys are going to change their minds now after they\xe2\x80\x99ve come out \xc2\xa0-- I guess from your -- you see their stance as somewhat damaging and that the public is going to be opposed to that, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve already done that damage then by saying, we refuse to do this. \xc2\xa0Why do you think that there\xe2\x80\x99s some chance that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to change their tune?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think most of my confidence rests in the clarity of the Constitution, the clarity of the precedent, and the clarity of Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s own knowledge of their responsibilities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell at this point exactly what sort of impact the public debate is going to have on this. \xc2\xa0My guess is it will play differently in different states. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard comments from others who value the institution of the United States Senate and who value the institution of the Supreme Court who have expressed concern about this process and about the Court in particular being politicized. \xc2\xa0And if Republicans follow through on what they\xe2\x80\x99re promising to do right now, it would escalate, in an unprecedented way, the degree to which the Supreme Court is politicized. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not good for Democrats or Republicans. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent with the Constitution. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent with past precedent. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent with the way that Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley have handled their responsibilities in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make, and it will be up to Senate Republicans to decide how they react.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Senator Reid said outside that the Vice President made reference in this meeting to his 1992 speech, what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cBiden Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he actually read passages of his speech to the Republicans. \xc2\xa0Can you shed any light on that? \xc2\xa0Did that happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed understanding of the exchange, but it sounds like what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is that Vice President Biden read the same passage that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read from here a couple of times about how, in 1992, he made clear that if the President was willing to consult with him that he\xe2\x80\x99d be open to supporting the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0He was saying that about a Republican President, President George H.W. Bush. \xc2\xa0That was relevant because at the time, then-Senator Biden happened to serve as the Chair of the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, I think the relevant precedent here is for us to consider what happened the last time that a President of the United States was asking the United States Senate to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. \xc2\xa0That year was 1988. \xc2\xa0There was a Republican in charge of the White House; there were Democrats in charge of the Senate. \xc2\xa0And the Senate followed through in bipartisan fashion with confirming Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0The precedent is crystal clear. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re just asking Republicans to do exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tI raise all that because at the time, Senator Biden was also the chair of the Judiciary Committee, so he had an important role in terms of presiding over that process. \xc2\xa0He ensured that Justice Kennedy got a fair hearing. \xc2\xa0He participated and actively supported a timely yes or no vote, and he voted yes. \xc2\xa0Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just asking Republicans to do exactly what then-Senator Biden did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to be clear -- are you confirming that that did occur in that meeting, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not -- that occurred or not. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two different things. \xc2\xa0A cybersecurity client asked if the President feels the U.S. is fully prepared for \xe2\x80\x9ca massive attack\xe2\x80\x9d on our power grid, financial network, et cetera -- emphasis on the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfully prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As you will note from our budget proposal that we rolled out just a few weeks ago, it includes a substantial enhancement of programs and funding to strengthen our cybersecurity in this country. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of steps that can be taken that relate to protecting government networks to working with the private sector to fortify key private networks. There are also some common-sense steps that American citizens can take to protect their own privacy and to protect their own cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there surely is more that we need to do in this country. Unfortunately, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out, Republicans, before this budget proposal was even put forward, basically canceled hearings. \xc2\xa0They said that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet with the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget director to discuss a budget that included a significant ramping up of our cyber defenses. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s rather unfortunate. \xc2\xa0I think it reflects a lack of seriousness on the part of Republicans in Congress for confronting this issue. \xc2\xa0And again, as I promised -- I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago -- at some point, sometime in the next 11 months that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this job, somebody out there is going to ask me about a specific cyber intrusion incident that either had consequences for the government or for a significant private sector company, maybe even a media company, and what I will observe is that while the President and his team put forward a thoughtful proposal for how we could improve cyber defenses in this country, Republicans refused to even discuss it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Shifting gears, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Mr. Trump understands that Presidents can\'t change laws on their own, but this talk from him about weakening libel laws so we could better control the press \xc2\xa0-- does the White House have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think my reaction is the same as yours, which is I have no idea what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The other thing about that, about press, the independent group, Reporters Without Borders, says that in terms of press freedom, the United States has now fallen to 49th out of 180 nations. \xc2\xa0And it actually lays the blame for some of that fall -- not all of it, but some of it -- on the Obama White House for what it calls harassment, government harassment to journalists. \xc2\xa0It cites the James Risen, New York Times case, and such. \xc2\xa0Does the White House bear any blame for the fall -- in what appears to be a fall in press freedom in this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Obviously, I strenuously disagree with the argument that Journalists Without Borders had made in that report. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed on many occasions that it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the independent media in this country to press those who are in positions of authority for more access and for more transparency. \xc2\xa0And that\'s part of the process, and I respect that role. \xc2\xa0In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s critical to the success of our democracy for independent professional journalists to play that role. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt sounds to me that that\'s exactly what Reporters Without Borders is doing by putting forward a provocative analysis like this to challenge and put pressure on those who are in power. \xc2\xa0And I certainly respect their desire to do that. \xc2\xa0But I think, on the merits, when you consider the climate and the environment in this country in which independent journalists have the opportunity to do their work, I just don\'t think that withstands much scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also been noted, though, that reporters continue to not have protection under federal shield laws that have sent maybe -- these eight whistleblower cases that the administration has prosecuted for that reason. \xc2\xa0Should reporters have protection under the federal whistleblower laws?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, Paul, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve reviewed our position on that particular policy question. \xc2\xa0But let me take a look into it, and we can certainly get you an answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you answered about Donald Trump, you were a little dismissive about the question about what he said about libel laws and so forth. \xc2\xa0And I wonder, are you concerned that Democrats may still be very dismissive of Donald Trump? \xc2\xa0Do you take him seriously as a potential nominee and a potential opponent in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly is -- again, you guys have written about this -- all the information I get about this is from what I read from all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, no, you get much more information from other --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0About Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign? \xc2\xa0I don\'t mean to disappoint you all, but I don\'t really have any -- I don\'t know anybody that works on the Donald Trump campaign. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any special sources over there at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, to go to your point, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that he has built a large following in the Republican Party and he\xe2\x80\x99s getting a lot of support. \xc2\xa0And again, based on the results from the states that have hosted elections so far, and based on the way that he appears to be lining up support from members of -- at least some members of the Republican establishment, that he does have the inside track to be the Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0And it certainly requires thinking back to the amount of time and energy that this President devoted to becoming the Democratic nominee in 2008. \xc2\xa0That\'s no easy task to win a party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. \xc2\xa0And so certainly we are keenly aware of the success that Mr. Trump has had out on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he\xe2\x80\x99s done it in a way that has raised concerns that I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed quite extensively in the past. \xc2\xa0And I have no doubt that if he is the Republican nominee and when we get to the general election, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to have a rather robust political debate about the stark difference in values and tone and priorities that Mr. Trump presents.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Supreme Court thing, has there been any -- have you gotten any indication from any Republicans that this wall that the leadership has put up, that there\xe2\x80\x99s any softening behind that wall? \xc2\xa0Have you got -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s communications, the White House communications with other members of the committee, for example, have you been told anything that suggests that there is a possibility that the leadership is not letting on to, there\xe2\x80\x99s some softening on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve alluded to, there have been a lot of conversations not just at the presidential level with people on Capitol Hill, but many more conversations that have taken place at the staff level. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think I can account for all of those conversations. \xc2\xa0But I think what I can do is sort of point to some public statements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from people like Senator Kirk and Senator Collins, who have indicated an openness to giving the nominee a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are other members who have indicated their reflexive opposition to anybody the President puts forward. \xc2\xa0But at least in some cases, they\xe2\x80\x99ve said that they didn\'t mind holding a vote on it. \xc2\xa0So as unreasonable as that position is -- to basically turn down anybody that the President may consider -- at least they\xe2\x80\x99re indicating a willingness to engage in the process.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that from Leader McConnell or Chairman Grassley yet. \xc2\xa0And they haven\xe2\x80\x99t shown that willingness, despite the fact that they have a constitutional obligation; despite the fact that there is a clear precedent here; despite the fact that they know exactly how important this is. \xc2\xa0But ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Everyone knows how important this is, and everyone knows why the Supreme Court issue is such a big deal, and why all the other precedents are somewhat -- perhaps not relevant because of the ideological shift in --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I disagree with that premise. \xc2\xa0And I apologize for interrupting you, but I think it is important to note that there is plenty of speculation about what impact the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee could have on the ideological balance of the Court, but there is no reference in the United States Constitution for a separate process if there is the perception of the conclusion reached by some senators that this could have an impact on the ideological balance of the Supreme Court; in the same way that there\xe2\x80\x99s no exception written into the Constitution for if this discussion is taking place in an election year. \xc2\xa0The President has very clear responsibilities, and the Senate has very clear responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So in terms of what the President is going to do, given the stakes, would you anticipate that there will be a very public campaign by the President directly to the American people to get his point across? \xc2\xa0Because clearly he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0As you said, no minds were changed and no positions were changed in this meeting with the leadership. \xc2\xa0And perhaps sooner rather than later -- you\'ve said he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to endorse a candidate, and so on and so forth -- but given the stakes, given where we are, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a lot of people out there who are advocating -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s supporters want him to be out there doing something sooner rather than later -- do you think that they will see that? \xc2\xa0Or will we see the traditional role that the President plays in reelections after the convention, so and so forth?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When it comes to the Supreme Court, I would anticipate that the President will make a public case for his nominee. \xc2\xa0But at this point, the stage in the process is the President is committed to consulting with the United States Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, and the President is carefully considering the record of potential nominees. \xc2\xa0That\'s the stage in this process.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we move forward, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the President playing a more high-profile role in advocating for his nominee and calling on the Senate to put their constitutional obligations ahead of their political considerations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the general election, though, I certainly think you can expect the President, over the course of the summer and fall, campaigning in support of the Democratic nominee -- whoever that is -- and his advocacy will be rooted in highlighting the difference in values and priorities and principles of a Democratic nominee who is committed to continuing the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years of digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and comparing that to the agenda put forward by Republicans to actually roll back that progress by going back to the rules that were in place in advance of the last economic downturn. \xc2\xa0And that will be the substance of -- the essence of the debate, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one, frankly, that the President looks forward to engaging in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, can you tell us anything more about some of these various advocacy groups that are trying to push for one nominee or the other, or be involved in the process -- the nomination process for the Supreme Court? \xc2\xa0To what extent -- what\xe2\x80\x99s happening between the White House and those groups, and how transparent is the White House going to be about what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing with these other groups? \xc2\xa0I know that a number of former officials were involved, and so on and so forth, but is that intensive planning underway? \xc2\xa0Are the meetings underway? \xc2\xa0What is the extent of that activity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The truth is the engagement on the part of the White House with outside organizations that are interested in being involved in the political process is something that happens every day on a wide variety of issues. \xc2\xa0Obviously the Supreme Court is different and unique because it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that comes up every year, it only comes up every once in a blue moon. And sometimes, like this year, it can come up unpredictably, without any advance warning.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously, the way in which that situation is resolved has significant consequences for our country. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s natural that there would be lots of outside observers keenly interested in how the process moves forward. \xc2\xa0And consistent with the way that we engage with outside groups on issues like immigration reform, on cybersecurity, on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to engage with outside groups as the President makes a decision about who to put forward for a nomination to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll also continue to engage in those conversations even after that nominee has been put forward in terms of making the case that the Senate should fulfill its constitutional obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Today is Super Tuesday. \xc2\xa0Voters in more than a dozen states will cast ballots or attend caucuses. \xc2\xa0It also means that, two weeks from today, voters in Illinois are going to host a primary. \xc2\xa0Do you have any guidance on how the President will participate in that election? \xc2\xa0Will that be in-person or absentee? \xc2\xa0And will we know his choice in the Democratic primary on or before or after that date?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President will cast an absentee ballot. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what he has done in previous primaries. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not that ballot has been submitted at this point, but that\xe2\x80\x99s how he will participate. \xc2\xa0At this point, there is no plan to make the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference public, but if that changes we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more on the Secret Service incident yesterday. \xc2\xa0You seemed to take a dig at the Trump campaign for confining journalists at their rallies. \xc2\xa0But if the reports are correct, what appears to have happened here is that an agent of the government and an employee of your administration acted to keep a journalist out of an area where the public at large was generally allowed. \xc2\xa0I mean, if Trump\xe2\x80\x99s security wants to ban journalists from walking around, that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of their business, but should an agent of the government be acting in this way? \xc2\xa0And should there be a review about the rules governing Secret Service in campaign settings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that the current situation that attracted so much attention yesterday is under investigation. \xc2\xa0And the Secret Service is working with local law enforcement to try to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. And the leadership of the Secret Service has indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take appropriate steps based on the conclusion of that investigation. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates more generally to the policies that are put in place by the Secret Service, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for what role they have to play here. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of considerations. Some of those considerations, Byron, relate to journalists are often screened prior to entering a large event like that, and that means that because they are screened, they are then given special access. \xc2\xa0For example, they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to go either close to the stage or, in some cases, even up on stage at the time. \xc2\xa0That would explain the need to not allow them to mix regularly with the crowds that we can make sure that the proper security precautions have been in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tI, frankly, do not know whether or not that was relevant to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s situation. \xc2\xa0But that would be an explanation for why, in some circumstances, a Secret Service officer would have to limit the movements, or at least limit the press\xe2\x80\x99s interactions with the public to ensure that future special access that they get to the candidate or other protectees can still take place.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to ask about a different issue, which is the transition. \xc2\xa0Congress passed a bill yesterday that requires the administration to set up some councils within six months of the election to help the staff and agencies turn over. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is going to sign that law, and if you can give us just a general update on the transition plan that\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jordan, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at the legislation and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a firm answer on that once we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to review it. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, in general, that as President Obama was preparing to take office in late 2008 and then in early 2009, we worked quite effectively with the Bush White House that had made a smooth transition a priority. \xc2\xa0The American people were quite well served by the Bush White House\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to that principle, and I can tell you that that is a principle that this administration expects to continue, if not even further enhance.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are significant consequences for our national security. \xc2\xa0It certainly positions the next President to hit the ground running, and that\xe2\x80\x99s important when doing the people\xe2\x80\x99s business. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we recognize that the previous administration made that a priority. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out, particularly when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about bipartisan cooperation in the context of the Supreme Court, the Bush White House did that even though they were coordinating with an incoming Democratic President. \xc2\xa0They recognized that the responsibility that they had to ensure a smooth transition superseded any narrow political consideration that they had to make, and they understood that that\xe2\x80\x99s because that\xe2\x80\x99s a constitutional duty of the President that after serving two terms, they hand the reins on to somebody else, and ensuring that smooth transition was in the best interest of the country. \xc2\xa0We certainly intend to fulfill that precedent, that commitment, and there\xe2\x80\x99s probably a lesson in there somewhere for Senate Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi, Josh. \xc2\xa0The People\xe2\x80\x99s Daily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you read it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Their lead story today says that the President will meet shortly with the President of China. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is that true? \xc2\xa0When will the meeting take place if it is true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously President Obama had an opportunity to talk to President Xi at least a couple of times just in the first couple of months of this year, usually in response to provocations from the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0And that consultation has been fruitful, as we see with the package of sanctions that will be voted on hopefully by the U.N. Security Council tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional meetings to tell you about at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you -- I believe the last time that President Obama had an opportunity to meet with President Xi was in Paris during the U.N. climate talks there back in December, so it\xe2\x80\x99s been a few months since they\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to get together. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when another meeting is on the books.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The same newspaper has an accompanying article which says that if the U.S. deploys the B-21 stealth bomber to Okinawa, it intimates the Chinese would attack that plane on the ground. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, in light of that kind of saber-rattling, how would you describe the relationship between China and the U.S. today? \xc2\xa0I mean, is it that tense? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that specific report, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to respond with a lot of specificity about that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say in general that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear that there have been some important areas where the United States and China have been able to effectively coordinate our efforts -- certainly compiling a package of sanctions to respond to North Korean provocations is one good example of that. \xc2\xa0The United States and China, by working together, did serve as a catalyst for the process that eventually resulted in the historic climate agreement in Paris. \xc2\xa0That would not have been possible without the world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest economies coming together and demonstrating a clear commitment to the success of that process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not attempted to paper over our differences in other areas -- most notably, I guess I would cite the current situation in the South China Sea that China has a pretty clear difference of opinion with a number of other countries in the South China Sea who have competing claims on certain land features in that part of the world. \xc2\xa0And while the United States is not a claimant to any of those features, we have encouraged all sides and all parties to try to come together and resolve their differences diplomatically without escalating the potential for a military confrontation. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interests. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s important commerce that flows through the South China Sea, and it would have a bad impact on the U.S. economy and on the global economy if that flow of commerce were somehow interrupted by a military conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with the Chinese, and hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to bridge our differences there. \xc2\xa0But I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a decent summation of where things stand with the Chinese right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Would it be accurate to say you believe that the Attorney General is highly qualified?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think the fact that she was confirmed less than a year ago by a bipartisan majority in the United States Senate would be an indication that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the President who believes that she\xe2\x80\x99s highly qualified, it\xe2\x80\x99s that Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate believe that she\xe2\x80\x99s highly qualified.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Then you\xe2\x80\x99re also aware it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate that that count was 56-43 -- a pretty big swing for it not to be a follow-up confirmation based on, if nothing else, the math. \xc2\xa0Is that accurate, that number, 56-43, based on your memory?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the vote totals but it sounds about right to me.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you see where I\xe2\x80\x99m going with this. \xc2\xa0In other words, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about someone who is highly qualified, has already been confirmed by the Senate 56-43, would it be fair to say that you believe she would make an outstanding nominee for the high court? \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President believe that to be so?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point about who the President is considering, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that she is somebody who brought to her confirmation process last year a set of impressive legal credentials that earned bipartisan support in the Senate. \xc2\xa0She also is somebody who, over the course of about a year on the job, has served the American people quite well as the top law enforcement official in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is certainly proud of the important work that she has done. \xc2\xa0But whether that has any impact on his thinking about the Supreme Court, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to wait and see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would it surprise you if he were to nominate her?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I think the President is going to consider -- cast a pretty wide net in his --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Based on the SCOTUSblog that we read the other day, it seemed that she sort of checks every box.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t deny that. \xc2\xa0I think that she probably does fit a lot of the criteria that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed. \xc2\xa0But I think there are other people who fit that criteria, too, and the President is committed to consulting people with a wide range of experiences and credentials, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll follow through on that commitment and he\xe2\x80\x99ll give this all careful consideration. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not she will be part of that process or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0She was on Fox News last night and she was asked about a comment that you made about a month ago when I asked you about the Hillary Clinton Benghazi emails.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I saw that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0And in particular, you remarked in your answer to me, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it with confidence that you felt like she would not be indicted?\xe2\x80\x9d and you said at the time, based on what some people at DOJ are saying, it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to happen. \xc2\xa0She refuted that last night. \xc2\xa0And I just want to kind of figure out or square what she said, based on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0She didn\xe2\x80\x99t refute it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing I read the transcript. \xc2\xa0She didn\xe2\x80\x99t refute it. \xc2\xa0She said that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I can tell you what she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s pull it out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So here\xe2\x80\x99s what was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because I think this is worth a discussion --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, absolutely. \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing -- we should also give some scrutiny to what Mr. Baier said, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, absolutely. \xc2\xa0This is what Bret said -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, how about this, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said this about Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s investigation from the White House briefing room. \xc2\xa0He said \xe2\x80\x98Some DOJ officials have said Hillary Clinton is not the target of the investigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They said that publicly, as reported by news organizations in this room, including Fox News.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo are officials briefing Josh Earnest?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you unequivocally that no one outside DOJ has been briefed on this in any case. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not our policy and it\xe2\x80\x99s not happened in this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you said some DOJ officials had made that comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They have. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve said it --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So were they making this comment to you specifically? \xc2\xa0Did you talk to someone? \xc2\xa0Did someone brief you in particular? \xc2\xa0Tell me where you got it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No one has briefed me. \xc2\xa0I have not talked to anybody at the Department of Justice with knowledge about this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you took --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My comments from that briefing were rooted specifically and entirely on public comments as reported by all of you, including by Fox News. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was it a particular person that you\xe2\x80\x99re quoting from -- that you saw on Fox News from DOJ?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the reports. \xc2\xa0We can send you the reports.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall, and I looked. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any particular DOJ official tell Fox News that they told you or that they have said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- no one has told me anything. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about what Department of Justice officials have told media outlets. \xc2\xa0All of you have reported this. \xc2\xa0It was on the front page of many leading newspapers across the country, and it was included in discussions on Fox News. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no secret here. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear exactly what has happened. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the Attorney General said and as I said at the time, and as I\xe2\x80\x99ll say again right now, this is an independent investigation And this is something that is being led by independent investigators at the Department of Justice, and they are making decisions based on the facts, and they\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions based on where the facts tell them to go. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that based on any consultation with me or anybody else at the White House. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re doing this based on an ongoing independent investigation that will be guided by the facts. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what they should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, so just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, you have no independent knowledge of anything that has to do with this investigation, and you were only making a broad statement based on what you\xe2\x80\x99d read in media accounts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I was making a very specific statement based on what I had read in a wide variety of media accounts. \xc2\xa0And that is in no way predicated on any secret conversations that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the Department of Justice, because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any secret conversations with the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about Ash Carter. \xc2\xa0He said that the White House does not -- or would not move with executive action to transfer detainees. \xc2\xa0Has the President made specific comments that he will not use executive action to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and therefore try to move detainees to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President say that publicly, either. \xc2\xa0The President has been asked on a number of occasions whether or not he would consider using executive action, and what he has said when asked that question is that right now we are focused on trying to work with Congress to get them to remove the obstacles that they have erected to prevent the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that this is important is the President and his national security team, including leadership at the Pentagon, have concluded that our national security interests would be advanced, that our country would be safer if we took away the symbol of the prison at Guantanamo Bay that terrorist organizations are using to recruit terrorists.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also know, based on the plan that was put forward by the Department of Defense, that we could actually save some money. \xc2\xa0We could actually better use taxpayer dollars by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, which is prohibitively expensive, and actually detaining suspected terrorists in the same way that we\xe2\x80\x99re detaining convicted terrorists in the United States right now. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are dozens of individuals who have been convicted of terrorism inside the United States who are currently being held on American soil in American prisons. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually pose a threat to our national security. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us more vulnerable. \xc2\xa0If anything, it actually makes us safer because those individuals are not out walking around and planning terrorist attacks. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated to the world that we can live up to our values and that we can prosecute our values, bring people to justice, keep the American people safe, in a way that is consistent with the kinds of principles that we hold dear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a couple nuggets on that. \xc2\xa0You did say that 20 years out we could save up to a billion dollars if we close it, comparatively speaking. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about Supermax in Colorado, for example, where there are a number of terrorists -- shoe bomber, underwear bomber, 9/11 conspirator -- so that is true. But my question was, would the President rule out using executive action to close it? \xc2\xa0And I guess the second part of that would be, would it be possible then, if that facility were closed, that they could be transferred to another U.S. military facility in another location if Gitmo itself were closed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think for the potential of using a military facility, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0They obviously are in charge of administering those facilities. \xc2\xa0What the plan contemplated was they took a look at the kind of criteria that they would use for any facility to serve this purpose -- and there are a variety of considerations. \xc2\xa0Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with people who do pose a threat to the public, so we need to make sure that the facility is secure. \xc2\xa0We also need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re holding a very high standard when it comes to protecting their basic human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn some cases, those individuals who are being detained would be going through a military commissions process, and so it would be more efficient if there is a place on site or relatively nearby, a place that\xe2\x80\x99s secure where those proceedings could take place. \xc2\xa0We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position where every time that an individual has a court appearance that we have to fly them to another location. \xc2\xa0But if we can just move them to a different part of the building, or drive them down the street, we can ensure that those processes, those legal proceedings are carried out more efficiently.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so those are the kinds of considerations that they consider. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know whether or not they have ruled in or ruled out potential military facilities. \xc2\xa0I think what they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably tell you is that we need to see Congress remove some more restrictions so that we can spend more money and devote more time to considering potential facilities and actually implementing this plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to be fair. \xc2\xa0So you\'re not -- the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ruled out executive action. \xc2\xa0He just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said yea or nay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And is it lawful to go from military facility to another one if that facility is on U.S. soil? \xc2\xa0That\'s the only thing I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about. \xc2\xa0Because going from facility to facility would seem to be under the DOD auspices, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if that\'s lawful if that particular facility say, Leavenworth, for example, is on U.S. soil. \xc2\xa0Are you aware -- is that lawful? \xc2\xa0Or have they determined that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\'t we check on your line of questioning -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you a better answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Toluse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I can just follow up on Gitmo before asking about Apple.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ash Carter said yesterday that it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to close Gitmo without Congress acting. \xc2\xa0Loretta Lynch has said something similar. \xc2\xa0The Joint Chiefs have also come out in pretty clear language to that. \xc2\xa0But when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about it, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said you\'re not going to take anything off the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- basically not going to take it out of the President\xe2\x80\x99s hands. \xc2\xa0You\'re going to leave the President the option of potentially using executive action in the future. \xc2\xa0So are all of these other administration officials off message when they\'re basically doing what you said you\'re not going to do, taking it basically off the President\xe2\x80\x99s table in terms of executive actions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, when it comes to the President wielding his executive action, the person that has the final word on it is the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And he certainly will do that in consultation with his attorneys because he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to following the law and that\'s exactly what he will do.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat that means for the way that he could use executive action with regard to this specific matter, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on that. \xc2\xa0The President will ultimately make that decision. \xc2\xa0But that\'s not a decision that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on right now. \xc2\xa0Right now the decision that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on is a decision that Congress needs to make to remove obstacles that prevent us from doing the right thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd by doing the right thing, I mean closing the prison in Guantanamo Bay, following the advice of the Pentagon leadership, following through on the steps that even Republican national security officials acknowledge would make us safer, and also taking steps that would save taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve compared this before to the kind of decision tree that Republican presidential candidates have set up for themselves, that when they\'re laying out their criteria and they\'re laying out their leadership principles, they\'re suggesting that they would protect the country, that they would follow the advice of our military leadership, and they would cut wasteful government spending. \xc2\xa0Well, by implementing this policy, we can certainly pursue and make progress against all three of those objectives. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the case that we\'re making to Republicans in the United States. \xc2\xa0After all, I think that\'s why a number of Republican national security experts have come out in favor of this approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I wanted to ask you about Apple, the case in New York that basically blocked the government from doing what you want to do in San Bernardino. \xc2\xa0I know there are differences between the two cases. \xc2\xa0But one of the things that the judge said -- and I want to quote from his ruling -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay the government has made the considered decision that it\xe2\x80\x99s better off securing such crypto-legislative authority from the courts rather than taking the chance on open legislative debate that might produce a result less to its liking.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And that was specifically about using this archaic All Writs Act to try to get into these phones. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a law from like the 1700s. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, should you all be more involved in the legislative debate to come up with something that\'s modern, to focus on encryption and come up with a law that sort of threads the needle on this that protects both security and privacy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, with all due respect to the judge in New York, a judge considering a similar but different set of facts in California came to a different conclusion and concluded that the government was -- that it was entirely appropriate for the government to pursue the action that we have laid out. \xc2\xa0But ultimately this is something that will go through the courts. \xc2\xa0And these are probably not the only two judges that will have the opportunity to weigh in on this particular set of policy questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look -- we talked a little last week. Too -- when it comes to Congress, asking them to do even easy things doesn\'t often result in a prompt progress. \xc2\xa0And I think all of us would agree that dealing with issues related to encryption are rather complicated, and I think the likelihood that Congress would be able to successfully and efficiently handle this matter is rather unlikely. \xc2\xa0But, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see how this plays out in the courts and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see if legislation is eventually required. \xc2\xa0But, again, if it is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there would be a lot of optimism that this is something that Congress would be able to do quickly or successfully.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more on this. \xc2\xa0The SCOTUS meeting today -- the Republican leaders last week said that they would also use the opportunity of the meeting to bring up other issues like opioid legislation. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, did any other legislation come up besides the Supreme Court nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I understand that there was a brief discussion both of opioid legislation and of criminal justice reform legislation. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s relevant because the Senate Judiciary Committee is the jurisdiction for those two bills. \xc2\xa0So there was a brief discussion of those issues. \xc2\xa0But the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus in the meeting and at the top of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda was a discussion about his constitutional duty to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious why President Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the photo-op at the start to make a statement, as he so often does. \xc2\xa0And certainly there were questions asked that could have let him make the case, about which he feels so strongly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mark, to be blunt about this one, in previous pool sprays in these settings when the President has invited the leaders down after Supreme Court vacancies, on one occasion, the President did speak to the pool and another one he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I think in this instance, given the pretty stark difference of opinion about how to proceed, the President felt like it would be more courteous to withhold his comments and allow the discussion to take place in private. \xc2\xa0But we had made a commitment to all of you that we\xe2\x80\x99d give you an opportunity to enter the room, at least briefly, at the top of the meeting, and get photographs and get a chance to evaluate the body language and all the other things. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we followed through in having a pool spray, even though the President decided to reserve his comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there an agreement with the Republican leaders about no statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I think this was a decision that the President made on his own. \xc2\xa0Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s his building, it\xe2\x80\x99s his office, and he called the meeting, so he certainly had the right to make a statement. \xc2\xa0But out of deference to the Republican senators that obviously vigorously disagree with his point of view, he decided to reserve his comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And although no minds were changed, he still feels the meeting was worthwhile?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0Again, because of the importance of any President consulting with the United States Senate in advance of putting forward a Supreme Court nomination, and that consultation should occur not along party lines but actually across party lines. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why Democrats and Republicans attended the meeting. \xc2\xa0And the President takes that responsibility quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is not the last conversation that the President will have with anybody in the Senate as he continues to contemplate who would be the best person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is his binder getting thicker? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, presumably, some of the materials that he has reviewed can be removed from the binder. \xc2\xa0But it is true that there is information that is regularly being forwarded to him for his review.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Chairman Grassley, in explaining why he won\xe2\x80\x99t even allow a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee, has said that the fact that this is taking place in a presidential election year gives us a unique opportunity to have a debate not only about who the President should be in picking a nominee, but the role of the Court itself. \xc2\xa0Why is that not a valid point of view? \xc2\xa0And wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President like to have a part in that debate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say, Mike, that we had that debate in 2012 and that was a debate that the President won -- he was reelected by a majority of the American people. \xc2\xa0And when he took office for a second term, he was given all of the rights and responsibilities that are vested with any President for four years. \xc2\xa0He was not elected to a term of three years and one month; he was elected to a four-year term. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked at some length, even prior to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s tragic and untimely death, about the President\xe2\x80\x99s intent to squeeze every bit of opportunity out of the time that he has remaining. \xc2\xa0And that means doing everything that he can to fulfill his constitutional duty to serve the American people. \xc2\xa0And that includes being vested with the responsibility to nominate candidates to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause after all, it would be unprecedented in the modern Court for a vacancy to last for more than a year. \xc2\xa0Given the significant stakes surrounding the cases that will be evaluated by the Supreme Court, we should make sure that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t considering those cases shorthanded and that they have the full complement of justices, that the Supreme Court can function the way that the founders of the Court intended. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s what the President feels a responsibility to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s laid out in the Constitution. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear precedent dating back to President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s final year in office when he was in a position to ask the United States Senate to confirm his nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0He did that in a presidential election year. \xc2\xa0He did that in his last year in office. \xc2\xa0He did that even though the other party was in charge of the Senate. \xc2\xa0But yet that other party -- understanding the duty that they have under the Constitution -- worked effectively with Republicans and with the Republican President to confirm Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, on Super Tuesday and the presidential campaign, does the possibility or even the probability now that Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee affect the way that the White House is planning for the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the fall campaign? \xc2\xa0In other words, would he be more active, do more events in the campaign if it\xe2\x80\x99s Donald Trump as the nominee versus what they would have done for Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that the President will be active on the campaign trail over the course of the summer and the fall. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a case that he is eager to make about how important it is for the next President of the United States to build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made thus far. \xc2\xa0And considering that all of the Republican candidates have run campaigns that I think can adequately be described as divisive and vowing to roll back so much of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years, I think that\'s a reason for the President to be involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President himself on this once we get to the general election. \xc2\xa0But that\'s the essence of the case that the President looks forward to making on the campaign trail later this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then lastly, has there been any calls that the President makes on these primary nights to the Democratic candidates to congratulate them, to talk to them about how the campaign is going? \xc2\xa0Or is there a point at which you expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll make the call to congratulate the presumptive nominee before any delegate threshold might have been --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has not been making calls over the course of these election nights. \xc2\xa0But I would anticipate that once a presumptive nominee has been chosen by Democratic voters across the country, that the President will make a congratulatory call, but also probably wish well the candidate who didn\'t win.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders -- regardless of the final outcome here -- have succeeded in motivating a significant portion of the Democratic Party to support their campaign, and the unity of the Democratic Party will be critical to our success in the general election. And while there are differences between the two Democratic candidates, those differences pale in comparison to the differences between the values put forward by the Democratic candidates and the values put forward by the Republicans candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Fred, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0As far as the nomination goes, the Supreme Court confirmation process has been extremely brutal going back at least to 1987. \xc2\xa0But the hope for the nominee that has to go through that has always been that there\xe2\x80\x99s light at the end of the tunnel. \xc2\xa0Based on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now, it just seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s a less than 50 percent chance of an actual confirmation. \xc2\xa0Do you think it is going to be hard to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen even some Democratic lawmakers -- attorney general in California, Senator Booker -- even sort of waved off being considered for this. \xc2\xa0Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to get someone to step up to want this nomination? \xc2\xa0Is the nomination worth having? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It absolutely is. \xc2\xa0And I do not anticipate having any trouble choosing the right person for the job and having that person accept the opportunity to go through the nomination process.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the nomination process, as you point out, is rigorous -- and it should be. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a lifetime appointment to the highest court in America. \xc2\xa0It should be a rigorous process. \xc2\xa0There should be lots of meetings, private and public. \xc2\xa0There should be days of hearings, under oath, where Democrats and Republicans ask tough questions, and the nominee in front of the American people on television, under oath, should answer those questions. \xc2\xa0That should be part of the process.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true, though, is that the process shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t unnecessarily be drawn out. \xc2\xa0You can have a rigorous, intensive process that isn\xe2\x80\x99t plagued by unnecessary delays. \xc2\xa0And since, I believe, the mid-\xe2\x80\x9870s, about the average amount of time it has taken for a Supreme Court Justice once nominated to be confirmed is 67 days. \xc2\xa0So we can spend about two months questioning and probing and evaluating the candidacy of whoever is put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at that point, that person should get a vote, a yes or no vote about whether or not they deserve to serve on the Supreme Court because they can serve the American people on the Supreme Court with honor and distinction. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is the case we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And given the -- as you said it should be -- very rigorous confirmation process, given it\xe2\x80\x99s a lifetime appointment, do you think it should be more rigorous than a confirmation process for a Cabinet position or a lower court position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that process for a Cabinet nomination or anybody who gets a lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary, that should be a rigorous process, too. \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that process function in a way that, frankly, over the last year or so has also been bogged down by Republicans. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s been a source of quite a bit of disappointment -- that the kind of obstruction that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing around the Supreme Court gets a whole lot more attention -- and it should -- but the fact is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this obstruction from Republicans since they took the majority in January of 2015 block any number of very qualified nominees to district and appellate court positions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been a source of some disappointment, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this obstruction that we see from Republicans is not unique, and is also -- that obstruction is also inconsistent with their constitutional duties. \xc2\xa0But, look, I understand that everybody treats the Supreme Court nomination with special attention and special care -- all the more reason that Republicans should pay special attention to the need to fulfill their constitutional duties.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:23 P.M.
