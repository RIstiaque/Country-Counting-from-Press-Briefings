EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 And Happy Valentine\'s Day.\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you\'re on board for our trip to Decatur, Georgia today.\xc2\xa0 Rest assured you can -- we\'ll be back in plenty of time for you to do something nice for your valentines this evening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So let me begin with a brief opening statement, and then we\'ll open it up to questions.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, we\'re headed to Georgia this morning where the President will discuss one of the initiatives that he unveiled in the State of the Union that will expand economic opportunity for the middle class and everyone working hard to get there -- high-quality preschool education for every child in America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Studies show that for every dollar we invest in a quality preschool program, we\xe2\x80\x99ll save more than 7 dollars because of the impact that a good early childhood education program has for our youngest students, including on things like graduation rates, teen pregnancy rates, and even violent crime rates.\xc2\xa0 The OECD estimates that the United States ranks 28th out of 38 for our share of children that are enrolled in high-quality preschool programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the point is that these programs have a profound impact on the lives of our children, and yet we\'re not doing enough on it.\xc2\xa0 States like Georgia and Oklahoma, which are states that are run by Republican governors -- and routinely vote for Republican presidential candidates, by the way -- have made important investments in these kinds of programs.\xc2\xa0 So there is no reason this should get bogged down in partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 And the President will call on members in his remarks today -- members of Congress in both parties -- to act quickly on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up for a few questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, Josh, moving straight to a political question -- it sounds like the Republicans are planning a full-scale filibuster of Senator Hagel.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still stand by his nomination?\xc2\xa0 And how do you intend to move on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President stands strongly behind Senator Hagel.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Senator Hagel would do a wonderful job in a very important role, which is leading the Department of Defense at a challenging time for our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Currently, we have 66,000 men and women in uniform who are deployed in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President talked in his State of the Union address earlier this week about the important transition that\xe2\x80\x99s underway there to bring those troops home.\xc2\xa0 We need our new Secretary of Defense in place to be a part of that process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We obviously have some looming questions about the impact of the sequester on the Department of Defense budget.\xc2\xa0 The outgoing Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has commented about the terrible impact that the sequester would have on our military readiness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Next week, there is a defense ministerial meeting in Brussels where the U.S. will meet with our allies who are currently making important contributions to the effort in Afghanistan to talk about the transition that\xe2\x80\x99s underway in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We need our new Defense Secretary to be there.</p>\n<p>It does not send a favorable signal for Republicans in the United States Senate to delay a vote on the President\'s nominee -- a nominee who is a member of their own party -- to be the Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 It\'s difficult to explain to our allies exactly why that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 It also sends a signal to our men and women in uniform who are currently deployed around the globe and who are currently serving on the front lines in Afghanistan and are taking fire today.\xc2\xa0 They need a new Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>So we urge Republicans in the Senate to drop their delay.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s why this delay is critically important:\xc2\xa0 There is a clear majority in the United States Senate for Senator Hagel\'s confirmation.\xc2\xa0 These delaying tactics are unconscionable and they should end right away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any kind of a strategy to have -- to avoid the delay or to get over this delay?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else that you guys can do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, we\'re in regular consultation with the senators on Capitol Hill about this.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made -- the views about this unconscionable delay that I\'ve mentioned have been made clear and are well-known by Republican senators who are -- who have put this delay in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One point that I do want to make about our cooperation with the Senate -- there are a number of legitimate questions; the Senate has a legitimate goal in advising and consenting on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees.\xc2\xa0 But this goes -- this is separate from that.\xc2\xa0 We have worked in close coordination with the Senate on this nomination.\xc2\xa0 We provided 20 member and staff briefings; 10 different congressional hearings on Benghazi in particular have been held; 6 different witness interviews; 40 inquiries that we\'ve responded to by producing more than 10,000 pages of documents.</p>\n<p>So our efforts to coordinate with the Senate on these issues is evident, to put it mildly.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are calling on the Republicans in the Senate to end their delay right away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, will the President make calls from Air Force One today or from the road today to some of these senators to try to move their objections?\xc2\xa0 We asked, also, Jay earlier about whether the White House would provide additional details.\xc2\xa0 Some of these senators seem to want sort of more granularity about who the President called on the day of the attacks or whatever.\xc2\xa0 Is he making calls?\xc2\xa0 Are you providing that additional information?\xc2\xa0 And will Panetta stay on as long as it takes to get the next Secretary of Defense confirmed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point have any calls to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 In terms of providing additional information, I just ran through a pretty extensive litany of -- the extent to which we have gone to try to provide information to the senators who are interested in some of these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of Secretary Panetta\'s status, it\'s my understanding that he will continue to have the -- hold the office of Secretary of Defense until Senator Hagel is confirmed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he travel to Brussels if it were to come to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For his travel schedule, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change -- even if he goes -- Secretary Panetta has represented the United States ably as Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President talk about that a little bit during his going-away ceremony last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we need is we need our new Secretary of Defense to be in place at this very critical time where we\'re consulting with our allies about the drawdown in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There is no substitute for that, and there is no good reason why he should not be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, last night, the White House said that the President is opposed to this idea in the House to extend the federal pay limit, but stopped short of saying he would veto it.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support it -- he would sign it if it were passed, he just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy signing it?\xc2\xa0 And how does that square with his plan to give a 1 percent increase to federal pay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not familiar with all of the details of that.\xc2\xa0 But I will get back to you on that today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House on board with the evolving Senate Democratic plan to avert the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand that Senate Democrats will be making a presentation later today about their plan for dealing with the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Based on the reports that I have seen, it appears that Senate Democrats have tailored their approach to fall in line with the President\'s favored approach, which means that it has balance; which means that there will be some increased revenues as well as some additional spending cuts to buy down the sequester; to do, as the President suggested in the briefing room just last week, that we should get a little room for Congress to go through its regular order to deal with the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, with the time and space to go through that regular order -- to pass budgets and do the other hearings and appropriations hearings and the things that they\xe2\x80\x99re involved with, that we can finally resolve this standoff.</p>\n<p>This is really important.\xc2\xa0 We saw, just a couple of weeks ago with the release of the GDP numbers, the terrible impact that planning for the sequester is already having on our economy.\xc2\xa0 It would be bad for our economy for the sequester to go into effect.\xc2\xa0 It would be bad for our military readiness for the sequester to go into effect.</p>\n<p>We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford any more self-inflicted wounds.\xc2\xa0 We have to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has put forward -- or will put forward today -- what I understand, based on reports -- will be a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 That is a positive sign.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that Congress will act in bipartisan fashion, as is required, to make sure that the sequester does not go into effect, both because of the consequences it would have on our economy, but also because of the consequences it would have on our military readiness.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, American Airlines and U.S. Airlines are announcing a merger today.\xc2\xa0 It would reduce the number of legacy airlines really down to three.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned at all about competition and what this will mean for prices for the consumer?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Department of Justice has a regular process for reviewing these kinds of private commercial transactions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that those reviews typically involve -- include the impact that these deals would have on consumers.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything that would get ahead of that reviewing process.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an immediate reaction.\xc2\xa0 You can check with the Department of Defense to see if they have anything -- I mean, the Department of Justice, to see if they have anything on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that -- I understand that this a DOJ problem.\xc2\xa0 But the President repeatedly said, even in his State of the Union and yesterday again, that he is there fighting for the American public.\xc2\xa0 From that point of view, would you see him fighting against this in any way because of the -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been experts saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to raise prices for the American public?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that exact question is, as I mentioned, is something that is typically included in Department of Justice reviews like this.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate for me to make that assessment from here based on what outside experts are saying.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an official Department of Justice process for reviewing these kinds of things, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them conduct their review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Rubio said yesterday that it looks like the administration is trying to scuttle immigration reform because they won\xe2\x80\x99t want to tie it to triggers on border security.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The only reason -- let me say it this way -- the primary reason that we are seeing immigration reform rise on the priority list is because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to put it there.\xc2\xa0 The President has been committed to immigration reform and fixing our broken immigration system for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s campaigned on.\xc2\xa0 It is something that was strongly supported by the American public.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President has been aggressively pushing since the opening days of his second term.</p>\n<p>The President is committed to working in bipartisan fashion with this so-called Gang of Eight that\xe2\x80\x99s emerging to deal with this issue.\xc2\xa0 The reasons for that are numerous.\xc2\xa0 Our broken immigration system has a bad impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 What we need to do is we need to level the playing field for both workers and employers.\xc2\xa0 We need an immigration system that reflects our nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has been committed to border security, which is a critical part of fixing our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 The President has done a number of things to put assets and focus attention on securing our borders.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work in bipartisan fashion to fix our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is tying it to border security a non-negotiable point for the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President that border security should be part of fixing our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 But the other thing that should be part of that is a clear path to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working on.\xc2\xa0 You saw that the President convened a meeting yesterday with some of the Democratic senators who are involved in this effort.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the President is engaged on this.</p>\n<p>I should point out one other thing.\xc2\xa0 The President has also been clear that this bipartisan effort needs to move promptly.\xc2\xa0 Delays and bickering is not something the President will tolerate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to let this get bogged down in the process.\xc2\xa0 We need to move expeditiously to get this done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is counting on.\xc2\xa0 And the President is interested in working with senators on both sides of the aisle, including with Senator Rubio to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you talk a little bit about the minimum wage?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some remarks from Speaker Boehner expressing reluctance to pass this.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s strategy?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s its thinking about the prospects for passing a minimum wage bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was pretty eloquent in his statement on Tuesday, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t say so myself, about why this is such a critical issue.\xc2\xa0 Raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour is good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole -- there are volumes of academic studies that have been produced examining this exact issue.</p>\n<p>Raising the minimum wage puts more money in the pockets of people who are likely to spend it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend it on food; they\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend it on clothes for their kids.\xc2\xa0 That is good for businesses large and small, and that is why the President -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason that the President is strongly supportive of raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other is the President believes that we need to reward hard work.\xc2\xa0 And currently, if you\xe2\x80\x99re the head of the household of four people and you have a full-time, minimum-wage job, you\xe2\x80\x99re working 40 hours a week but making minimum wage, you\xe2\x80\x99re raising your family below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 That is not right.\xc2\xa0 That is not a situation that should exist in this country.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to solving it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And because of some of the tax measures that the President has put in place that you heard Jason Furman talk about yesterday, and by raising the minimum wage, we could solve that problem.\xc2\xa0 The President remains committed to standing on the side of middle-class families and those families that are scratching and clawing trying to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something the President is going to continue to fight for.</p>\n<p>Now, one other thing I want to point out in the minimum wage -- the last two times that we have raised the minimum wage, Republicans were instrumental in the effort to get it raised.\xc2\xa0 So in the late 1990s -- I know that then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was involved and supportive of the effort to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 And the last minimum wage increase that we saw in 2007 was signed into law by President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 Republicans should support it this time, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also talk a little bit about the pre-K education plan?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how we would ensure that these are high-quality pre-K programs.\xc2\xa0 What will be the mechanism to make that happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of information in the fact sheet that we put out last night about some of the important standards that need to put in place.\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re right -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t just need early childhood education problems, we need high-quality early childhood education programs.\xc2\xa0 So the President wants to put -- include standards for curriculum.\xc2\xa0 He wants to include standards for teachers to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re well-trained and highly-qualified to teach our youngest students.\xc2\xa0 He wants to make sure that we have a low adult-to-child ratio in the classroom.\xc2\xa0 He wants to make sure that class sizes aren\xe2\x80\x99t too big.\xc2\xa0 And, most importantly, he wants to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re continually evaluating these programs to ensure they\xe2\x80\x99re having the intended effect.\xc2\xa0 So there are in place some high standards that the President wants to make sure that we live up to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much will it cost the federal government provide universal pre-K?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, as I noted at the beginning, this is a really good investment of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 That for every dollar we put into these early childhood education programs, we save more than $7 because of the impact that these programs have on the lives of our children.\xc2\xa0 They have a measurable impact on everything from graduation rates to income potential to literacy rates to even violent crime rates,\xc2\xa0 Teen pregnancy rates is another example.\xc2\xa0 So this is a good investment of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the specifics about how much this program would cost, that will be included in the budget that the President plans to release next month.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also remind you that the President committed in the State of the Union address to ensuring that proposals like this will not add to our deficit.\xc2\xa0 And, again, how we\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for this program will also be included in the budget released next month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about Palm Beach this weekend?\xc2\xa0 What is the President going to be doing?\xc2\xa0 Is he meeting with donors of any kind?\xc2\xa0 Is he staying at a private home or in a hotel?\xc2\xa0 Is this -- what kind of trip is this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you point out, Jim, the President is traveling to Chicago for an event to talk about the economy tomorrow morning -- or early afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And then after that event, he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to Florida where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend President\xe2\x80\x99s Day weekend relaxing with some friends.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no work on the schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the image of Palm Beach?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be -- even Marco Rubio in his response was pointing out about how middle class he is.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to have the Republicans on the ropes in that way.\xc2\xa0 What is the symbolism of going to Palm Beach for the weekend where so much money is, and where donors are always at?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to enjoy the President\xe2\x80\x99s Day weekend with some friends, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, the President of the United States is the President of the United States 24 hours a day, and will fulfill his responsibilities as President even while he\xe2\x80\x99s getting some well-deserved downtime with some friends this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American people will begrudge him that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you pointed to the potential for improved graduation rates from this early childhood program the President is proposing.\xc2\xa0 Yet, Georgia still has one of the lowest high school graduation rates in the country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s had this program that the President is touting for more than 15 years.\xc2\xa0 Would the administration look for deficiencies in that program as it comes up with its own standards?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, suffice it to say the President is committed to ensuring that we incorporate best practices in these high-quality early childhood education programs.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the specific details of the Georgia program.\xc2\xa0 All I know is it\xe2\x80\x99s something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time investing in and making a priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they only have a 60 percent enrollment rate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that certainly will be -- one of the reasons that the President is so committed to this program is because he believes that every child should have access to a program like this.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one of the things that we would want to improve upon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what\xe2\x80\x99s important right now is demonstrating the political will to make smart investments.\xc2\xa0 And, again, these investments are smart not just because they make a lot of financial sense for the country, but also because, as the President pointed out, we have no higher priority than making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in and taking care of our kids.\xc2\xa0 And ensuring that the youngest students in this country have access to high-quality educational programs is a top presidential priority.\xc2\xa0 And this is the way that we can do something really important about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, there\xe2\x80\x99s a report out this morning that Iran has sought to acquire tens of thousands of specialized magnets that are used in the nuclear process.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the U.S. has been tracking?\xc2\xa0 And if it is true, does that speed up the timetable for action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for your question, Josh.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to actually read you an answer we have here:</p>\n<p>We are well aware of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive efforts in violation of its U.N. Security Council Resolution obligation to obtain sensitive materials for its uranium-enrichment program.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position at this time to comment on any specific transaction.\xc2\xa0 The unprecedented international sanctions put in place against Iran are not only designed to crystallize the choice for the Iranian regime regarding its nuclear program, but also to deter and disrupt Iranian procurement of components to support its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The international restrictions have choked the supply of critical components for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program so that Iran today falls far short of the goals it set for itself and its nuclear program only a few years ago.\xc2\xa0 We hope that the Iranian regime will make the strategic decision to come to the P5-plus-1 talks on February 26th in Kazakhstan prepared to discuss substance, so that there can be progress in addressing the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the nature of the Iranian nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We -- the United States certainly remains ready to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any prospect for bilateral talks with Iran at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to report at this time.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the ground, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t10:56 A.M.
