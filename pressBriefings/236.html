Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t*Please see below for corrections to the transcript, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:18 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I see some of my radio colleagues have decided to trade places today, so I encourage that kind of outside-the-box thinking. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0If you guys want to do a little musical chairs, that would be fine with me.</p>\n<p>\n\tWelcome to the Friday briefing, it\xe2\x80\x99s finally Friday. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a very interesting and even historic week here at the White House. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided today to pull a little page from a strategy that has been employed very effectively by some of our cable news colleagues here, that in addition to the regularly scheduled programming, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit of a crawl across the bottom with some additional information that can supplement your understanding of some of the arguments that are being made as it relates to the historic Iran agreement that was announced today.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to discuss that if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, but I know there are a number of other questions that may be top of mind. \xc2\xa0So, Darlene, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, thank you. \xc2\xa0I have a couple of questions on the shooting yesterday in Chattanooga. \xc2\xa0And I was wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any information emerging yet that points to a possible motive for the killing of those four Marines.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene, this tragic shooting occurred only about 24 hours ago. \xc2\xa0And the President yesterday took the opportunity to convey his condolences to the families of those who were lost in the shooting. \xc2\xa0Those families continue to be in the thoughts and prayers of everybody here at the White House, even today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President received a briefing yesterday both from the Director of the FBI, as well as his top\xc2\xa0counterterrorism\xc2\xa0advisor here at the White House, Lisa Monaco, to get an update on the investigation. \xc2\xa0The Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, is obviously involved in these ongoing investigative efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, I do not have an update on the status of their investigation. \xc2\xa0I know that the FBI made clear yesterday that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a variety of possible motives, including the possibility of domestic terrorism. \xc2\xa0So that is a part of their ongoing investigation, but I will allow the investigators themselves to provide you with an update when they\xe2\x80\x99re able to. \xc2\xa0The President indicated yesterday that he wanted to try to keep the American public informed as much as possible, in a timely fashion, on this ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that our investigators will do exactly that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what about information on whether anyone else was involved in the shooting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at all of these questions in the context of the investigation. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional information about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Army Chief of Staff said earlier today that security at military recruiting centers and reserve centers would be reviewed. \xc2\xa0Does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to beef up security at places like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President certainly believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for the Department of Defense to conduct a review like that. \xc2\xa0The President alluded to this in his statement yesterday, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to take the necessary steps to ensure that our men and women in uniform are safe, particularly when it comes to our men and women in uniform here at home. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there was an announcement from the Department of Homeland Security about some additional steps that they would be taking. \xc2\xa0There are some facilities that are jointly operated by the federal government and the Department of Defense, where the Department of Homeland Security has jurisdiction. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Homeland Security for additional steps that they can tell you about. \xc2\xa0There will be some steps, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident, that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to discuss publicly. \xc2\xa0But it certainly makes sense that the Department of Defense would be considering doing something similar.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, lastly, the daily guidance for today included this rare line; it said the President will remain overnight in New York to spend time with his daughters. \xc2\xa0Usually, you all would just say he\xe2\x80\x99s remaining overnight in New York. \xc2\xa0Can you flesh out the father-daughter weekend a little bit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is an opportunity -- as you know, the President is and had been scheduled to travel to New York for a fundraising event. \xc2\xa0That is not particularly unusual. \xc2\xa0But yes, the President is looking forward to a rare opportunity that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to spend a little personal time with his daughters in New York over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot of details in advance about their activities. \xc2\xa0But the press pool will obviously be there with the President, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll inform -- your colleagues will be participating -- well, maybe not participating, but at least traveling along. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That might interfere with the personal nature of the father-daughter time. \xc2\xa0But obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that you guys are aware of what they\xe2\x80\x99re up to.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, what can you tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Saudi Foreign Minister this morning? \xc2\xa0Were there any discussions of commitments the U.S. might make to defend Saudi Arabia in the context of the Iran deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Julia, this is a meeting that King\xc2\xa0Salman\xc2\xa0requested the President host in the conversation that the two leaders had earlier this week. \xc2\xa0I believe it was actually on Tuesday that the President had the opportunity to speak with King\xc2\xa0Salman\xc2\xa0via telephone in Philadelphia. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as a result of that request, the President did sit down and have a discussion with the Saudi Foreign Minister,\xc2\xa0Adel\xc2\xa0al-Jubeir, to discuss a range of regional and bilateral issues, including the recent historic agreement that was announced this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall from the Camp David meetings that occurred back in May, the President and the GCC leaders pledged to further deepen the security cooperation between the United States and our GCC partners. \xc2\xa0That includes building an even stronger, enduring, and comprehensive strategic partnership aimed at enhancing regional stability and prosperity. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in the context of those discussions, the Foreign Minister and the President also talked about the important bilateral relationship that exists between the United States and Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0And there was a discussion about how to further enhance that close and longstanding partnership. \xc2\xa0And I guess that will be the subject of some discussions that Secretary Carter will have with his counterparts when he visits Saudi Arabia next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere also was an opportunity for the President and the Foreign Minister to discuss some other regional issues, including the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen -- crises, I guess, in Yemen and Syria. \xc2\xa0And there was a discussion about how to move both those conflicts toward a political solution. \xc2\xa0There also was a discussion of the ongoing\xc2\xa0counter-ISIL\xc2\xa0campaign of which Saudi Arabia is an important part. \xc2\xa0We certainly value the kind of contribution that Saudi Arabia has already made to that effort. \xc2\xa0And there was a discussion about the progress that that effort is making as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So those discussions on how to further enhance commitments, were those firm or were they kind of ongoing? \xc2\xa0Or were there commitments made?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, they were a continuation of discussions that took place at Camp David back in May. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the strategic priority that the United States has identified is to not just deepen the bilateral security cooperation that exists between the United States and each individual GCC country, but rather to facilitate better coordination and cooperation among the GCC countries, and that there may be equipment and skills and training that the United States can offer that would make those countries more effective in coordinating their security efforts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn some cases, that involved the interoperability of some hardware. \xc2\xa0In some cases, that just involves facilitating training so that they can more effectively coordinate their efforts. \xc2\xa0And the President and the GCC leaders, when they discussed this issue at Camp David, agreed that there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly an important role for the United States in terms of standing closely with our GCC partners when it comes to their security situation. \xc2\xa0But that should not be to the exclusion of the GCC countries operating more effectively when coordinating with one another to provide for their own security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also, this morning, Secretary Kerry was speaking on MSNBC, and he said that he raised the topic during the Iran negotiations of Americans being detained in Iran every time he had a chance to meet with the Iranians in the final weeks of the negotiations. \xc2\xa0And he described it as he\xe2\x80\x99s very, very hopeful that Tehran may listen and release those three Americans. \xc2\xa0Does the President share that same level of optimism? \xc2\xa0And what evidence does Kerry have, or the President have, to be that optimistic?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess for the characterization of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s comments, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department. \xc2\xa0But I think this -- what his comments should indicate to you is the priority that the President places on the safe return of these Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President gave a persuasive explanation in his news conference earlier this week in describing why he did not believe it was in the best interest of those detained Americans to be used as bargaining chips in a nuclear negotiation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first reason is that it was not a foregone conclusion that a nuclear agreement would be reached. \xc2\xa0And by attaching the plight of these unjustly detained Americans to a deal that may or may not go through does not seem like the most effective way to ensure their safe and prompt return.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut -- and I think the President went to great lengths to convey this too -- that does not mean that these individuals and their safe return are not a priority. \xc2\xa0In fact, they are. \xc2\xa0And the fact that Secretary Kerry so frequently raised them in the context of the negotiations I think should be an indication to you where the well-being of these American citizens falls on our priority list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there evidence that something may be in the pipes, that we may see a release soon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What there is evidence of is a rigorous U.S. government effort to try to secure the release of these individuals. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed update to provide you on our ongoing efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You just mentioned that there might be some equipment or expertise or otherwise that the U.S. could offer to Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0Did the President make such an offer either in his talk with King\xc2\xa0Salman\xc2\xa0or with the Foreign Minister today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, the discussions that took place both on the telephone with King\xc2\xa0Salman\xc2\xa0earlier this week and in the Oval Office with the Foreign Minister today were a continuation of the discussions that took place at Camp David. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the other thing I think that is notable about this is that there was unanimity of opinion that those kinds of conversations are constructive, and do further deepen and advance the relationship between the United States and our partners in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf region. \xc2\xa0And the President understands that the U.S. relationship with each of those countries is critical to the national security of each of those individual countries. \xc2\xa0The President has also concluded that having a strong relationship with those countries is clearly within the national security interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of these kinds of ongoing consultations. \xc2\xa0And again, these are consultations that will continue when Secretary Carter visits Saudi Arabia early next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that meeting put on the schedule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, typically, when -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start by saying that it is a little unusual for the President to meet with the official of a country who\xe2\x80\x99s not also the head of state. \xc2\xa0And this was, as I mentioned, a particular request from King\xc2\xa0Salman\xc2\xa0that the King made in the context of their telephone conversation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is not something that was formally listed on the President\xe2\x80\x99s guidance, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the explanation for why.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And in the outreach that the White House has been doing with people here, as well as overseas, the White House mentioned yesterday that there were a number of offers made to have these intensive consultations with Israel, but they repeatedly turned it down. \xc2\xa0Why are they not wanting to have those discussions right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s a question that you should ask them. \xc2\xa0The fact is this is -- the President believes strongly in the value of the security cooperation between the United States and Israel. \xc2\xa0And there are a variety of ways in which that national security cooperation benefits the United States and our national security. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a number of Israeli officials indicate that the security cooperation -- or the security relationship that Israel has with the United States is critical to the basic national security of Israel. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a variety of ways. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the most illustrative example is the effectiveness of the Iron Dome system that was initiated, implemented, and ramped up at the direction of President Barack Obama. \xc2\xa0This is a system that last summer shot down a number of rockets that were fired by extremists in Gaza that were aimed squarely at Israeli civilians. \xc2\xa0That has turned out to be a very powerful tool in saving the lives of Israeli citizens. \xc2\xa0And the President has communicated directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu a willingness and even a desire to enter into specific discussions about how our security cooperation could be deepened and strengthened and further enhanced. \xc2\xa0And we stand ready and eager to initiate that conversation or to enter into that conversation when the Israeli officials determine that they are prepared to do so. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would indicate that this is not a -- let me say two other things. \xc2\xa0This is not an indication that somehow the security cooperation between the United States and Israel has been degraded in any way. \xc2\xa0In fact, Prime Minister Netanyahu has indicated that the level of security cooperation that his country has received from the Obama administration is unprecedented, and that cooperation continues. \xc2\xa0And I can just give you two examples of that over the course of the next week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is, Defense Secretary Ash Carter will be traveling to Israel early next week, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with his counterparts and other senior Israeli officials to discuss our ongoing security cooperation. \xc2\xa0And just this week, I understand that the head of\xc2\xa0counterterrorism\xc2\xa0at the State Department convened an important security cooperation meeting with the Israeli Deputy National Security Advisor. \xc2\xa0And this was a discussion where they talked about a range of issues, including shared concerns -- these are concerns shared by the United States and Israel -- about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in the region, including by supporting their proxies in the region, like Hezbollah, that do menace Israel. \xc2\xa0So this kind of security cooperation is ongoing and the administration is eager to seize on the next opportunity that emerges to start discussing how we can deepen that cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When was that meeting, did you say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The State Department meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was a meeting that occurred earlier this week. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which day. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the State Department can give you more details on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then the outreach that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing with members of Congress here -- even some Democrats have expressed skepticism. \xc2\xa0Is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s stance that if they were to vote and then possibly even override a veto to keep congressional sanctions in place, would the U.S. then be in violation of the deal, or would the deal break apart? \xc2\xa0Or what are you conveying to members of Congress that would be the biggest problem if that were to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, the fact is, if the United States Congress were to successfully kill this agreement, it would have a terrible impact on the standing of the United States in the world. \xc2\xa0This is an agreement not just between the United States and Iran; this is an agreement between the United States, Russia, China, Germany, the U.K., and France, and Iran. \xc2\xa0And this is an agreement that is enthusiastically supported by, as the President said, 99 percent of the international community. \xc2\xa0And for the United States, because of a congressional action, to isolate our country on such an important issue would be devastating to our standing in the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also would have some very practical consequences. \xc2\xa0The first is that the reason that our sanctions regime against Iran succeeded in compelling them to the negotiating table is because it had a devastating impact on their economy. \xc2\xa0The economic ties between the United States and Iran are not particularly significant, primarily because there are a whole host of other sanctions and embargoes that the United States has unilaterally placed on Iran. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe key to the success of this latest round of sanctions has been the aggressive enforcement of countries around the world, including countries that aren\xe2\x80\x99t even a party to this particular agreement -- countries like India, Japan, South Korea, and others that previously relied heavily on the importation of Iranian oil -- and by scaling back their oil purchases that had a negative impact on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economy but also had a negative impact on the domestic economy of those individual countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is that the sanctions regime would collapse if Iran*[Congress] were to kill this deal. \xc2\xa0And what that means is it means that the international leverage that we have previously used to reach this agreement would vanish. \xc2\xa0The second is, Iran would still obtain the financial benefits of sanctions relief -- something that our critics have described as a financial windfall. \xc2\xa0And the problem is, is Iran is going to get all of that money and the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get anything for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, because of the sanctions relief that\xe2\x80\x99s being offered, Iran is taking a number of significant steps to curtail their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to dramatically reduce their stockpile of enriched uranium. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to remove 13,000 centrifuges. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to overhaul and essentially dismantle, or all but dismantle, their plutonium reactor at Arak. \xc2\xa0And Iran has committed to cooperating with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if the U.S. Congress votes to kill this deal, Iran will get all the benefits of this deal without having to give up anything. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think ultimately has to be a fundamental question that members of Congress have to ask themselves. \xc2\xa0Because the fact is, at this point, based on the conclusion that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached by 99 percent of the international community, Iran is going to begin at some point -- under this deal -- will begin to receive sanctions relief after they have taken demonstrable verified steps to significantly curtail their nuclear program, and to make a public commitment that they will not obtain a nuclear weapon and that they will cooperate with a set of international inspections that will verify that they do not obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0Or Congress can vote to allow Iran to get off scot-free, and to get all the sanctions relief. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the fundamental question that is facing members of Congress right now. \xc2\xa0And this is the essence of the case that administration officials have been making to individual members of Congress, and this will be the case that senior administration officials will be making in open testimony in Congress next week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Help me with the math. \xc2\xa0You said a number of times, 99 percent of the world community. \xc2\xa0The President said 99 percent of the world. \xc2\xa0Where is that number coming from?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess if you look at the population of the countries that are represented in this particular agreement, the vast majority -- 99 percent of the world -- is on the side of the United States and our international partners in implementing this agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you done the math on our allies in the region, the ones that would be most directly affected by this agreement? \xc2\xa0What percentage of our allies in the Middle East support this deal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them all speak for themselves. \xc2\xa0But at least when it comes to Foreign Minister Al-Jubeir, who is at the Oval Office today, he indicated that -- when he was at Camp David he indicated that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d -- meaning, Saudi Arabia -- \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome the discussions on the nuclear program between the P5+1 and Iran.\xe2\x80\x9d And Saudi Arabia has been assured that the objective is to deny Iran the ability to have a nuclear weapon, and that all pathways to a nuclear weapon will be closed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me the Saudis support this deal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m telling you that the Saudis will speak for themselves. \xc2\xa0But they -- it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you -- I just asked you about our allies in the region. \xc2\xa0So I know he supported diplomacy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But again, you can ask them what their view is of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the President just met with him; I assume the topic came up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I assure you that it did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do the Saudis support this deal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I will let them speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do the Emiratis support this deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I will let them speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do the Israelis support this deal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think they made pretty clear that they don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear, Jon, is you know who does support the deal? \xc2\xa0The Germans, the British, the French. \xc2\xa0Certainly, the President. \xc2\xa0The Chinese, the Russians, the South Koreans, the Japanese, the Indians. \xc2\xa0All of the countries that were involved in pressuring Iran to come to the negotiating table in the first place. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President is going to be in New York. \xc2\xa0We understand he is not staying at the Waldorf, which is typically where he stays. \xc2\xa0Is this because the Chinese now own the Waldorf?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about where the President will stay tonight. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are a number of factors that influence the decision about where the President will spend the night when he is not at the White House. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of those logistics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is this a concern? \xc2\xa0And I know this came up shortly after the sale of the Waldorf. \xc2\xa0But this is obviously the home of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a place the President typically almost always stays when he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York. \xc2\xa0Is there a concern about basically it being hosted by the Chinese?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- it is, as Darlene pointed out, it is unusual for the President to be spending the night in New York. \xc2\xa0Typically, the President will just do day trips to New York and come back. \xc2\xa0So typically the only time that he would spend time overnight in New York is when he\xe2\x80\x99d stay two or three days for the United Nations General Assembly. \xc2\xa0And when he does, he does typically stay at the Waldorf.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he be staying at the Waldorf this time for --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the President will be staying this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then I just also want to ask you this question of Congress. \xc2\xa0A number of congressional -- a number of senators of both parties have raised concerns that basically this deal is going to be voted on at the United Nations before it is voted on by the U.S. Congress. \xc2\xa0Is there any hesitation about that here at the White House to go to the U.N. before you actually go to Congress?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0And the reason is that -- the first is, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reflect that this agreement is not between the United States and Iran; this is an agreement between the P5+1 and Iran. \xc2\xa0And I know you know this, but just for those who are following this debate, P5 is actually a reference to the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. \xc2\xa0So it certainly is natural that those who are party to this agreement would be acting promptly to take it up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is clear are a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is, there is nothing that the United Nations Security Council will do that would have an impact on sanctions that are imposed by the United States, sanctions that are imposed by Congress, sanctions that are imposed by executive order. \xc2\xa0The United Nations Security Council has no jurisdiction over that, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t have any influence over the decisions that are made as they relate to U.S. sanctions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is that the way that this vote is structured actually does reflect significant deference to the United States Congress, and that is we do anticipate that in the next few days there will be a vote by the United Nations Security Council, but it will not be adopted for 90 days.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what that means is -- or I guess what\xe2\x80\x99s convenient about that is we know that there is a 60-day window for Congress to consider this agreement. \xc2\xa0And that means that Congress will have ample opportunity to do so, within their 60-day window, before this agreement is sort of formally adopted after the U.N. Security Council vote. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s see -- Justin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First, if I can just follow up on what you said to Jon. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if that means -- I know that you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Congress will have a veto-proof way to overturn the deal. \xc2\xa0But if they were, would you go back to the United Nations during that 30-day period and ask them to revoke the agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I would not speculate on what would happen if Congress were to take the devastating effort -- or to succeed in the devastating effort to undermine the successful implementation of this agreement. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk maybe generally -- I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of outreach going on with Capitol Hill -- but where you\xe2\x80\x99re targeting your support? \xc2\xa0I know the other day you mentioned House Democrats that had written a letter, and you felt like that was a number that kind of prevented, or was enough to sustain a veto. \xc2\xa0Is that the group that you\xe2\x80\x99re mainly focused on showing up at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me be clear about that. \xc2\xa0What that letter said -- and we can produce that letter for you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in front of you. \xc2\xa0This was a letter that was written in May by about 100 -- I think it was signed by about 150 House Democrats. \xc2\xa0And that is enough to sustain a presidential veto. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what these Democrats indicated at the time was that they were supportive -- again, generally speaking, you should quote from the letter -- but that they were supportive of a final agreement that reflects the kind of outlines that were established in the Lausanne agreement in early April. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that does give us some confidence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got strong support among House Democrats. \xc2\xa0That, truly, is not support that we take for granted. \xc2\xa0And there have been a number of conversations -- too many to count already -- between senior White House officials, senior national security officials, and House Democrats. \xc2\xa0But those are certainly not the only conversations that have occurred. \xc2\xa0The President himself has had conversations with senior leaders in Congress in both parties, and between --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has that gone past the four leaders that you read out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the details of exactly who the President called, but I can confirm for you that they were in both houses and in both parties. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there have been, again, a large number of other conversations that Secretary Kerry has engaged in, that the Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, that the national security advisor, Susan Rice -- all of those senior officials have spent ample -- significant time on the phone with members of Congress, in some cases even had meetings in person. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been a number of other group meetings that have been convened by other national security advisors to the President. \xc2\xa0And these consultations will continue. \xc2\xa0And they will -- these conversations will continue between Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the other thing that I would say, to put it bluntly, is that if there is anybody in Congress who has questions about the agreement -- look, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated. \xc2\xa0You guys have probably -- many of you probably thumbed through this already. \xc2\xa0There are a lot technical details that are included in here, and we have acknowledged on the front end that these technical details are critically important. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we spent so much time negotiating them. \xc2\xa0And frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we blew past the deadline on June 30th to make sure that the details were right.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it certainly is understandable that there would be specific questions that people would have, and we would welcome the opportunity to get to answer them regardless of who in Congress is actually asking the questions. \xc2\xa0So I can assure you that if there are individual members of Congress that want to have a phone call or have a meeting to discuss this, that we can put them in touch with a relevant member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team to have that discussion and to answer all the questions that they have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two quick travel ones. \xc2\xa0The first is, are there any plans for the President to go visit Chattanooga? \xc2\xa0And the second is related to the fundraiser today in New York. \xc2\xa0I know in previous off-years you guys have kind of set a number of fundraising goals for fundraisers for the President, for the DNC. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re going into 2016 elections and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be extremely expensive. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you guys have concrete, tangible goals of how much the President hopes to fundraise or how many fundraisers he hopes to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Justin, at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel as it relates to Tennessee, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you updated if that changes.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tangible number to give you in terms of our fundraising goal. \xc2\xa0The President is mindful of both the significant stakes in the next election, and also his ongoing responsibility, even though he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ballot, to be strongly supportive of those Democrats who share his vision for the future of the country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the President has been engaged in some fundraising efforts already, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that over the next year and a half that the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in this political debate in the advance of the next presidential election will only increase.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to go back to the issue of the U.N. \xc2\xa0Why submit a draft resolution at this very moment? \xc2\xa0And I understand the explanation that you gave to Jon, but it has clearly only roiled a number of lawmakers. \xc2\xa0It seems like at this moment you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to sell this deal to lawmakers to get them onboard. \xc2\xa0Why do that at this moment when it seems to have only aggravated that situation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Kristen, this is an agreement that was negotiated between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany. \xc2\xa0And it makes sense that once that agreement has been reached, that the U.N. Security Council would act promptly to consider the agreement. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut out of deference to the United States Congress, there is a 90-day window before this approved resolution is formally adopted. \xc2\xa0And what that means is it means that there will be time for Congress to use all the 60 days that they themselves requested to review the agreement, and to consider that agreement and even vote on it before the action that is taken at the U.N. is formally adopted. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it bears repeating that there is nothing that the United Nations Security Council can or will do to impact the sanctions that the United States has put in place, particularly those sanctions over which Congress has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry said earlier today that he will be traveling to Doha to speak with officials in the Gulf States about the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0What will the President\xe2\x80\x99s outreach look like in the coming weeks? \xc2\xa0And what does he say to the argument that some officials there have been making that this ultimately emboldens Iran, whether or not you agree with this deal? \xc2\xa0That ultimately it emboldens Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the administration will continue to engage with our partners in the region. \xc2\xa0And I think --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What will the President do? \xc2\xa0What will that outreach look like?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember Secretary Carter is traveling to the Middle East over the weekend and into next week where he\xe2\x80\x99ll spend time both in Israel and Saudi Arabia meeting with top officials there. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be some discussion of this Iran agreement, but certainly not the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou mentioned Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s meeting. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve made careful note, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, of all of the telephone calls that the President has already conducted this week with our allies and partners around the world to discuss this. \xc2\xa0So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there will be -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s a high level -- a commitment to high-level engagement when it comes to discussing this issue with our partners and our allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the question that you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised about an emboldened Iran, I guess I would disagree with I think a basic premise of that question, because as a result of this agreement, Iran will not obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0There is nothing that Iran could do to be further emboldened than to obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo by taking the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran off the table, we can now focus on the other steps that are necessary to constrain their threatening of Israel, their support for terrorism, their support for proxies that destabilize the political situation in the volatile Middle East. \xc2\xa0These are other significant concerns of our allies and partners in the region, and the United States remains committed to helping those countries address them.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, as the President said in his news conference on Wednesday, there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that this has been -- that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon has been a top priority for the President. \xc2\xa0Because a nuclear-armed Iran only makes them more dangerous, and certainly does only further embolden them. \xc2\xa0This is a view that\xe2\x80\x99s been articulated by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a shared priority against which we are making important progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you characterize to what extent did this specific issue come up during today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that it did. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details of the conversation, but, yes, you can be assured that this was -- a significant part of the discussion was on this particular issue, both the agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached, but also deepening the security cooperation between the United States and our GCC partners to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about a domestic issue, something that has been the topic of big debate. \xc2\xa0Some employees with Planned Parenthood were captured on video talking about fetal remains, the remains of aborted fetuses. \xc2\xa0Does the President have a reaction to this debate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about this particular issue, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll acknowledge that I have not seen the particular video in question. \xc2\xa0I did read the news reports indicating that the policies that are followed by Planned Parenthood are entirely consistent with the strictest ethical guidelines that have been established in the health care industry. \xc2\xa0But for those kinds of details, I\xe2\x80\x99d obviously refer you to Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And, Josh, just more broadly, does the President think that it is ethical to use the remains of aborted fetuses for medical research?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are medical ethicists that have taken a close look at this, and Planned Parenthood, I understand, has said that they follow those ethical guidelines and, in fact, the highest of those ethical guidelines. \xc2\xa0For their compliance with them and what exactly that means, I\xe2\x80\x99d obviously refer you to them. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have intimate detail of --or intimate knowledge of the kinds of practices that they engage in. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the video, so no indication that the President has?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quick question on Israel, a related question. \xc2\xa0Is the administration considering the release of Jonathan Pollard?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there is -- what I\xe2\x80\x99d do is I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice on this. \xc2\xa0Obviously, Mr. Pollard is somebody that has been charged with serious crimes and is being confined in our criminal justice system, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on his status. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just in the meeting with Foreign Minister Jubeir, was there any discussion of a visit by King\xc2\xa0Salman?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any potential visits to talk about at this point, but if we have any updates on that we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Continuing on the discussion with the ambassador, was there any indication or discussion with the President of the ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s team meeting with his counterparts in Israel in the lead-up to the Iran nuclear deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say that one more time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there any discussions with the President in that meeting with -- in terms of any Saudi meetings with the Israelis in the lead-up to the Iran nuclear deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any meetings between the Saudis and the Israelis, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those two parties for details about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the President -- obviously opposition to this deal in Israel is bipartisan across the spectrum. \xc2\xa0Would the President be interested in going to Israel and explaining the deal to Knesset, as Bibi did, coming here to Congress? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is a provocative idea, Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Knesset invited him --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right, exactly. \xc2\xa0To answer your basic question, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans to do anything like that. \xc2\xa0But more generally, the President is mindful of the fact that this agreement is something that is being carefully scrutinized in Israel. \xc2\xa0The President I think was pretty forthright about acknowledging in the news conference that he convened with all of you on Wednesday that he\xe2\x80\x99s not just aware of the concerns that many Israelis have about Iran and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. \xc2\xa0The President was forthright about acknowledging that those concerns are entirely legitimate. \xc2\xa0And the President has also been pretty forthright about acknowledging that the President has those concerns in mind when he goes to this effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt continues to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s through diplomacy that Iran will voluntarily take the steps that are needed to shrink their uranium stockpile by 98 percent, to remove 13,000 centrifuges, to fill in the calandria at their heavy-water reactor with cement to ensure that it can no longer be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And the important part of this is not that Iran has made those commitments, but that we can actually check to make sure that they live up to those commitments. \xc2\xa0And we have imposed the toughest, most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to verify their compliance to the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that does not eliminate other concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. \xc2\xa0But when Iran threatens Israel and uses anti-Semitic rhetoric to do so, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we strongly condemn. \xc2\xa0And we understand -- the President understands the very significant danger that that poses to the nation of Israel. \xc2\xa0But that danger would be even more severe if Iran had a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has made this a priority, and the President is committed -- in even conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu -- to trying to work more effectively together to counter many of the destabilizing actions that Iran engages in in the region, including by supporting Hezbollah.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, Josh, what if the Israeli Prime Minister -- he\xe2\x80\x99s already said that all options are on the table for him. \xc2\xa0What if the Israelis, using U.S. equipment, bombed the Fordow facility and some of these other Iranian nuclear facilities? \xc2\xa0How would the U.S. respond to that? \xc2\xa0Obviously, we have deals where we have sworn support with the Israelis in almost any regional war. \xc2\xa0What if they create a regional war that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to, in this case?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Gardiner, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on that particular hypothetical beyond acknowledging that obviously Israel -- the leaders of Israel are entitled, of course, to take the steps that they believe are necessary for the defense of their country. \xc2\xa0They have a responsibility to make those decisions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has also indicated that the military option on the part of the United States is one that continues to be available. \xc2\xa0But the more effective way, the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through principled diplomacy -- an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s structured exactly like this one that requires Iran to take some significant steps to curtail their nuclear program, and to agree to have those steps be rigorously verified by the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ash Carter is going to be in Israel next week. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be asking sort of what the Israelis need. \xc2\xa0What if the Israelis ask for these bunker-busting bombs and equipment that would allow them to do this bombing raid on their own? \xc2\xa0How would the U.S. respond to those sort of requests?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview those conversations at this point. \xc2\xa0But as a general matter, I can tell you that part of the message that Secretary Carter will be delivering when he travels to Israel -- and I believe this will be his first trip as the Secretary of Defense to Israel -- that the message that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be delivering is that the United States and President Obama himself is committed to strengthening the security cooperation relationship that Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has already described as unprecedented in its scope and depth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As part of the deal, Iran can appeal to the Security Council if it feels that any members of the P5+1 are not abiding by the agreement. \xc2\xa0If Congress votes this down, the U.S. of course will not be able to abide by the agreement through sanctions. \xc2\xa0If the U.S. does not lift its sanctions, Iran could potentially appeal to the U.N. Security Council about the failure to lift those sanctions. \xc2\xa0Would the Security Council vote then, trump that of the United States Congress? \xc2\xa0Is that a concern in this? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Gardiner, I\'m not going to speculate at this point about what would happen if Congress were to devastate the standing of the United States in the international community, and essentially give Iran the opportunity to get all the benefits of sanctions relief without having to take any steps to submit to international verification or any of the steps that are required to curtail their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can we follow up on a couple of those lines of questioning. \xc2\xa0Take the question about a potential Israeli military strike a step backward. \xc2\xa0Will the President argue -- even maybe in the conversation with the Prime Minister -- that with the deal it is now less necessary and Iran is less threatening to Israel in terms of a nuclear question than it was before the deal? \xc2\xa0That any reasons Israel might entertain are less menacing than they were before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And the reason --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that what the President would say?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is certainly part of the argument. \xc2\xa0And that is because the foundation of this argument is that as it -- what our intelligence analysts assess right now is that the breakout period for Iran is only two to three months. \xc2\xa0Once this agreement is implemented, the breakout period for Iran would be lengthened significantly to a year, and we would also be in a position to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement. \xc2\xa0That means that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have much greater insight into the details of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And we do believe that when you sort of compare a nuclear-armed Iran versus a non-nuclear armed Iran, that we would much rather have the latter because it is not as dangerous as a nuclear-armed Iran would be. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t downplay the concerns that we have with a number of their other activities in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. \xc2\xa0Clearly you would expect the Defense Secretary to carry that very same message to Israel based on this topline assessment, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it fair and logical, therefore, to assume that everything that corresponds between these two nations in terms of security cooperation would be informed by that judgment? \xc2\xa0Meaning, if there were requests for some of the material that you were just asked about, those requests would be viewed within this new context. \xc2\xa0Iran is less threatening, the danger is diminished; therefore, that\xe2\x80\x99s the context in which all those requests will be judged -- not the one that existed before the deal. \xc2\xa0Fair to assume that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it is fair to assume that. \xc2\xa0However, what I would also commend to your attention is just the reminder that, for some period of time now, the United States has been having conversations with Israel about how we can further strengthen and deepen our security cooperation. \xc2\xa0These are conversations that have even been had between the two leaders of our countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the fundamental question is, every discussion about whether it\xe2\x80\x99s within Israel\xe2\x80\x99s rights to strike the materials they might have to carry that out are in a different context because you have this deal now? \xc2\xa0And the threat is diminished, and therefore all the conversations that might come under the umbrella are in a completely different context?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what is true is that the breakout period has been lengthened, and that means that -- and we have assurance, or we will have assurance that Iran is complying with the agreement. \xc2\xa0If, at some point, we determine that they are not complying with the agreement, we will continue to have the wide range of options in front of us that we do today, and whether that means snapping back sanctions or even deploying a military option.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing I would point out about the military option is that if the agreement has been implemented, and Iran has started to take the steps to -- and it will be implemented once Iran has taken the steps to limit their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention earlier, which is sanctions relief will not start until Iran has taken all of these substantial steps to begin to curtail their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an important thing for us to keep in mind here.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the point is, is that if over the course of this 10-year agreement, at some point Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders change course and they decide that either they want to cheat or they just want to publicly indicate that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to break out and try to obtain a nuclear weapon, it would take a year for them acquire enough fissile material to build a bomb. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the key thing. \xc2\xa0The military option would remain on the table, but the fact is, that military option would be enhanced because we\xe2\x80\x99d been spending the intervening number of years gathering significantly more detail about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0So when it comes to the targeting decisions that would be made by military officials either in Israel or the United States, those targeting decisions would be significantly informed, and our capabilities improved, based on the knowledge that has been gained in the intervening years through this inspections regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So if Israel wants to contemplate it, it should wait?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, what we believe --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what you just said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we believe is the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been achieved here. \xc2\xa0But if at some point down the line, after the agreement has been implemented, if Iran does indicate a willingness to cheat, or they just announce that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go and sprint toward a nuclear weapon, that distance would be much longer than it is today, and the ability of the international community to respond would be strengthened because our political hand would be strengthened and the capabilities of our military planners would be enhanced because of our significantly increased knowledge of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to ask about the Pollard situation, because your predecessors have never hesitated on that question. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it or you were trying to convey something, but previously, when Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s name has been brought up, the answer is very swift and resolute. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not on the table, it\xe2\x80\x99s not being discussed. \xc2\xa0The crime is a crime, the conviction is a conviction. \xc2\xa0It stands -- despite the fact there has been annual lobbying of varying intensity, but every year from the Israelis, whoever the government is, about Jonathan Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s release. \xc2\xa0Did you hesitate because that is now, at some level or another, being discussed? \xc2\xa0Or were you just not anticipating the question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I was not anticipating the question. \xc2\xa0But what I can tell you is that there -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not aware of any sort of renewed discussion about what had been previously discussed about releasing him outside of the normal Department of Justice procedures that are in place. \xc2\xa0There has been some discussion about releasing him primarily -- that has been reported on, about releasing him prior to his next parole hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that that position has changed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t become a new topic within the conversations in the aftermath of the Iran deal or any other things that might sweeten Israel\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0But for the details of his current incarceration, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0They may have more information for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A question about the trip to Oklahoma. \xc2\xa0The President said, in a question from the pool, after meeting with some of the inmates, that they were there after doing stupid things, making mistakes, he said -- there but for the grace of God, suggesting that -- and I want to ask you this. \xc2\xa0Did he mean to suggest that the people in there that he met with were arbitrarily arrested, prosecuted in there because it was sort of an accident? \xc2\xa0Or such a low-level mistake that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been there in the first place? \xc2\xa0Or that their sentences should be dramatically reduced? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if the latter is the case, my reading of the Durbin and Lee legislation, which this White House has endorsed, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take away mandatory minimums. \xc2\xa0It provides a little bit more discretion for federal judges; but in the main, it keeps most of the sentencing guidelines and the prosecution of the past in place. \xc2\xa0Does the President want to go farther than that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are a number of factors that influence the sentences that are given to the individuals who are charged and convicted of serious crimes -- well, I should say, certainly of serious crimes, but also of crimes that relate to non-violent drug offenses. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re influenced by a number of things -- things like mandatory minimums, but also things like the policy that is in place for prosecutors who are trying to make charging decisions; that there are significant decisions that need to be made by prosecutors when it comes to how serious a crime that individuals should be charged with based on their conduct. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making is that there are a variety of things that influence the kind of sentence that is handed down, and it is those variety of things that will be considered in the discussions with Congress as we sort of work toward some criminal justice reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, I do -- let me give you a -- the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to make either of the points that you suggested. \xc2\xa0The point that the President was trying to make is that for him, in some ways, this is -- the point that he was trying to make is even outside the context of the criminal justice system, that these individuals did things that landed them in prison. \xc2\xa0And it also set them on a path that made prison more likely because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t benefit from the influence of good parents or good schools or caring teachers or people in their community that could provide some structure to their lives; that even if they did make a mistake, that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow one mistake to put them on a path that had them end up in prison.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the point the President was making is that he has acknowledged and has, as he wrote about in his book, made some mistakes in his own life, but he benefitted from having grandparents in Hawaii, teachers at his school, obviously a very devoted mother who worked hard to keep him on the right path despite his mistakes. \xc2\xa0And the point that he was making is that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that kind of support structure in his life, it is not hard to imagine that he would have ended up on the same path that led these men to that prison.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this is a comment about the structure, not necessarily the underlying crime itself, the adequacy, or the fairness of the prosecution, or the sentences meted out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0Clearly all those things are related, but the point that the President was making is this very specific one about the kind of support structure that is particularly needed for young men of color. \xc2\xa0And this is part of My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper initiative that the President has spent a lot of time talking about; that trying to put in place these support structures for young men of color that may be coming from a single-parent home and may not be coming from the highest-rated school in their community, that they will benefit from additional support structures that, even if they make one mistake, could prevent them from going down a path that ends in a prison cell.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to follow up on something you said earlier, give you another run at it. \xc2\xa0I was trying to understand -- Secretary Kerry was saying during the conversations with the Iranians that he repeatedly would bring up the American captives that are being held there, and yet the President made it very clear that it was not part of the deal because it would give the Iranians more leverage in some ways and would make the deal more difficult. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to make sense of the two. \xc2\xa0Can you help me unpack that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, actually, the point the President was making, Kevin, is that if we included the wellbeing of these Americans as bargaining chips in the nuclear deal, it would only make it harder to secure the release of these American citizens. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that is simply that the successful completion of a final nuclear agreement was not a foregone conclusion. \xc2\xa0And if we had gotten the case of these Americans wrapped up in a nuclear discussion that ultimately didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to an agreement, the ability of the United States to secure their release would have been significantly set back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what the President and Secretary Kerry did was they worked assiduously to keep them separate, to not allow these American citizens to be used as bargaining chips in a nuclear discussion with Iran. \xc2\xa0But what Secretary Kerry did in the context of these meetings is insist on the release of these Americans who had been unjustly detained in Iran. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make concessions to Iran in the context of an agreement to secure their release; we just think they should be released right now and they should be given the opportunity to come home and be reunited with their families. \xc2\xa0And that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be contingent on anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the tragedy in Chattanooga. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about the fact that perhaps if military personnel were able to be armed, they could have better protected themselves. \xc2\xa0If that were deemed appropriate by DOD, would the White House support that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, these decisions about how best to ensure the safety of our men and women in uniform are decisions that are made by the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0And as you alluded to, there is a Department of Defense policy that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place for quite some time, in sort of at a workplace like a recruiting station here in the United States, that would prevent military personnel from carrying weapons. \xc2\xa0But those are security decisions that will be made by the Department of Defense, and they will be made not with politics in mind but with the safety and security of our men and women in uniform in mind. \xc2\xa0And obviously those are the kinds of policy decisions that the Commander-in-Chief would support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple more. \xc2\xa0One on the meeting today with the Saudi Foreign Minister. \xc2\xa0Can you understand that the main concern that they would have, especially given the proxy wars that have been happening with the Iranians, and what can the President do to assuage their concerns that anything you do to either elevate Iran economically or even politically makes them a bigger player in the region and therefore a bigger threat to the Saudis and other GCC partners?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no scenario where Iran is a bigger threat than when they have a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And that is why the President has gone to great lengths and supported nearly two years of negotiations to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And that is the case that the President made not just to members of Congress but to our partners all around the globe. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat in no way is intended to diminish the significant concerns that our partners and our allies in the Middle East have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism, their support for proxies that destabilize a political situation in countries throughout the Middle East. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be responsive to those concerns, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with those countries to deepen our security cooperation and more effectively counter Israel\xe2\x80\x99s*[Iran\xe2\x80\x99s] efforts to support, for example, Hezbollah rebels that are operating in Lebanon or Houthi rebels that are operating and destabilizing the political situation in Yemen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last, I want to ask you about Glass-Steagall. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some talk about bringing that back. \xc2\xa0Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, among others, think that would be a good idea. \xc2\xa0Does the President agree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, what we believe is that Wall Street reform has been incredibly effective in reforming our financial system in a way that looks out for the interests of middle-class families and taxpayers. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall the Wall Street reform created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \xc2\xa0For the first time, middle-class families have an independent watchdog in Washington, D.C. that\xe2\x80\x99s not beholden to corporate interests but is actually focused on standing up for the interests of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And this has led to important reforms in both the mortgage-banking system but also to the student-loans system, and a variety of other reforms that have protected the interests of middle-class families against the interests of larger financial institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Wall Street reform also included were restrictions on big banks that prevent them from making risky bets that would result in taxpayers having to bail them out if those bets go south. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is pleased with the important progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made when it came to implementing Wall Street reform. \xc2\xa0The implementation of a lot of these rules was aggressively fought by some of the highest-paid special interests in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the tenacity of the President and his administration that these rules were put in place in a way that maximizes the benefits not just for middle-class families and not just for taxpayers, but for our broader economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But Glass-Steagall? \xc2\xa0Thumbs up, thumbs down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, we believe that the kind of ongoing implementation of Wall Street reform is the most effective way for us to protect our economy and for us to protect both middle-class families and taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s see. \xc2\xa0Who have we got in the back here? \xc2\xa0Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about Cuba. \xc2\xa0Is the President, the administration making any headway at all on getting Congress to at least consider lifting the embargo?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I ask only because Monday we were told the opening of the embassies. \xc2\xa0Is that going to usher in any new push from the administration to try and get particularly opponents in Congress to reevaluate their position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, there already exists bipartisan support for advancing the policy that the President announced to normalize our relations with Cuba. \xc2\xa0But there have been some entrenched partisan interests that have tried to block this in Congress so far. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, there are a number of steps that the President can take using his executive authority to begin to make these changes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is implementing these changes because he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the broader strategic interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0We have removed a chief sticking point in our ties with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. \xc2\xa0And by removing that sticking point, we have now effectively isolated Cuba and the international -- or at least the concerns of countries in the Western Hemisphere, and focused them on the Cuban government\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the Cuban people, and the failure of the Cuban government to respect the basic human rights of the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s one way in which this policy change has been important. \xc2\xa0The second thing that we know is that this is a policy that is overwhelmingly supported by the Cuban people themselves; that they recognize that this is a tremendous opportunity for them to have a government that treats them with the respect for basic human rights and allows them to -- or at least makes it more likely that they can achieve the ambition that they have laid out for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that I think many people are pretty unpersuaded by the objections that have been raised by some in Congress. \xc2\xa0They claim to have the best interests of the Cuban people at heart, but when you look at some of the public data, more than 90 percent of the Cuban people actually support the policy that the President is trying to implement.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward using all of the authority that we can to try to implement this policy change. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that this is going to cause a significant change in the mind of that small but vocal minority in Congress that opposes this policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if it were a vocal minority, it would be easy to lift the embargo.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If only the United States Senate worked that way. \xc2\xa0But as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I think that there continues to be some confidence that this vocal minority in Congress -- or in the Senate could filibuster this legislation. \xc2\xa0But the fact is that there are a number of Republicans who have come out and spoken forcefully in favor of this policy change.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And any travel announcement as far as the President potentially making a trip to Havana?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No updates at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just following on that -- obviously, the President has talked about the questionable human rights record in Cuba. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about what, for example, the administration would need to see from Cuba in order for you to even consider having the President go? \xc2\xa0What kind of would be the bottom line or benchmark that this administration would apply to key countries like that when deciding whether it deserves a presidential visit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say, for a detailed answer to this question, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you in general that some of the things that we would like to see is, we would like to see the rights of political opponents of the Cuban government inside of Cuba not be thrown in jail just because of their political views. \xc2\xa0That would be one step.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second would be the respecting of the basic rights of independent journalists in Cuba; that there is evidence to indicate that there is not free speech in Cuba, and that even independent journalists who want to say things that could be perceived as critical of the government have their views muzzled by the government. \xc2\xa0So a respect for a free and independent media would be another step that we would like to see them take.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are a couple of examples. \xc2\xa0But for more specific benchmarks, to the extent that they exist, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thank you. \xc2\xa0I think Mitch McConnell said it would be unlikely that they would approve an ambassador to Cuba. \xc2\xa0Is there a way around that? \xc2\xa0And do you have someone who you want to -- whose name you want to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements at this point. \xc2\xa0I think there are probably some good candidates in mind. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any intent to nominate anybody any time soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans in Congress use all kinds of excuses to not act on nominees that are put forward by the Obama administration even when they have important and noncontroversial roles in the government. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that a couple of weeks ago, I came here and talked about the plight of Adam Szubin -- this is the individual who is responsible for putting in place sanctions and targeting the financing activities of ISIL. \xc2\xa0This is a career civil servant who\xe2\x80\x99s served in Democratic and Republican administrations. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who is unquestionably an excellent lawyer, and very skilled at the technical job that he has. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut yet, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Congress -- Republicans in Congress block him from even having a hearing. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no legitimate explanation for that, and it does reflect a --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\ta dereliction of duty when it comes to Republicans in Congress when you consider that we\'ve got thousands of U.S. military personnel helping counter ISIL in Iraq right now. \xc2\xa0And all we\'re asking Congress to do is to hold a simple hearing, a basic responsibility of the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0But yet that\xe2\x80\x99s something that Republicans are unwilling to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point is, based on the kind of inexplicable obstruction that we\'ve seen for even noncontroversial nominees like Mr. Szubin, I would not expect any rapid progress in the Republican-dominated Senate when it comes to the consideration of a nominee to be the ambassador of Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we could have an embassy but no ambassador for a while?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It certainly seems possible. \xc2\xa0But for that rather unique scenario to exist, that\'s something that would require the continued partisan obstruction of Republicans in Congress. \xc2\xa0So I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have another exhibit that probably numbers in the tens of thousands at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You could put a nominee forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly possible. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t rule that out. \xc2\xa0I just don\'t have any details for you on the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ayatollah Khamenei is giving a speech tomorrow in which it\'s expected that he\xe2\x80\x99ll respond to the Iran deal, which does cross several of his red lines, including inspection of military sites. \xc2\xa0What are your concerns that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to come out strongly against the deal, or come out against the results?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t predict at this point what the Ayatollah may have to say tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have concerns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not particularly concerned about it, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the week ahead. \xc2\xa0Well, this is weird. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if I have a week ahead. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0This is the week ahead for this week, actually. \xc2\xa0Maybe it\'s back here in the back pocket. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot less interesting to you -- I was about to tell you about the White House Conference on Aging -- (laughter) -- which I know that you all covered with a lot of attention this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\xe2\x80\x99s get to the week of July 20th. \xc2\xa0There are some interesting things on here. \xc2\xa0On Monday, the President will host Nigerian President Buhari at the White House. \xc2\xa0The visit will underscore the United States\xe2\x80\x99 longstanding friendship with Nigeria, our commitment to strengthening and expanding our partnership with Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s new government, and our support for the Nigerian people on their historic democratic elections and peaceful transfer of power.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat afternoon, the President will deliver remarks at a reception for the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to address the 116th Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention. \xc2\xa0So we\'ll have a little preview of those remarks early next week. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we\'ll have something interesting to say there.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing the convention, the President will travel to New York City and will tape an appearance for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. \xc2\xa0So that should be entertaining. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will meet with small business owners to discuss the importance of the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House. \xc2\xa0And later that evening, the President will travel to Nairobi, Kenya. \xc2\xa0The President will spend most of the day on Friday en route to Kenya. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I wish you all a good weekend. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:28 P.M.
