EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for coming.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 A State Department official, a deputy special representative for the regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that the flooding there and the crisis there is a long-term crisis that\'s going to get worse.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the administration about how this will affect --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, this catastrophe is one that\'s on a human scale and widespread, and the United States is doing everything that it can to help the country of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve given them tens of millions of dollars in aid.\xc2\xa0 U.S. helicopters and C130s are there delivering hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and medical supplies.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow Secretary Clinton, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah will be up at the U.N., focused on this issue as well, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking more about the needs.\xc2\xa0 We\'re responding to all the requests that come in from the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with them and NGOs on the ground to ensure that we\'re doing all that we can to help them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur relationship with Pakistan is one that\xe2\x80\x99s more than just about fighting armed extremists and we\'re hoping to help them where we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one follow-up to that.\xc2\xa0 There was an article last week about how many of the charity arms of some of these violent extremist groups have come in to fill the void, to get supplies much faster and relief much faster to the Pakistani people.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s concern that that could win over people to their cause.\xc2\xa0 What is the response of the administration?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that this is an ongoing humanitarian crisis.\xc2\xa0 We\'re responding very quickly, as are our international partners.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that we\'re going to do what we can to help those folks out.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.N. said that aid to Pakistan is flowing a lot slower than it did for Haiti and other disasters.\xc2\xa0 Is the President thinking about going before the American people like he did with the Haiti case, to make an appeal for more aid?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Clinton has done that, and we\'re responding as quickly as we can to their requests as they come in so that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what\xe2\x80\x99s possible to help the folks who are most in need.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, this is ongoing and we don\'t even know the full scope of the disaster just yet.\xc2\xa0 But you can bet that the United States is going to continue to do its part to help those folks that have been so terribly affected.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance that the President might add Pakistan to his Asia trip now?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard any discussion of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the President talked again today about how a lot of people are still hurting and there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to go in the economy.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any concerns at all about at least the\xc2\xa0 perception of taking a 9, 10-day vacation in an affluent part of the country at a time when a lot of people are hurting?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s an American person who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President is working hard to do everything possible to get this economy back on the right track, to move initiatives through Congress that are going to help businesses right away to create jobs and to make our economy even stronger. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe President -- any presidential vacation -- whenever you talk about a presidential vacation you ought to put the word \xe2\x80\x9cvacation\xe2\x80\x9d in quotes because you can bet that there will still be work that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing every day.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll continue to get his daily intelligence brief from John Brennan who will be there.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be getting constant updates on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the economy and other issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do think that just like a lot of American people, the President is taking a little time with his family to recharge his batteries.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s really into batteries.\xc2\xa0 We spend a lot of time at battery plants.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll be spending a lot of time doing that this weekend. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he staying at the same place he did last year?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to announce where he\xe2\x80\x99s staying until he gets there for security reasons. But he\xe2\x80\x99s renting a house.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will be announced when he gets there?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Of course, you\xe2\x80\x99ll all be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say he really needs a vacation?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say that -- you guys have seen him out on the trail this week.\xc2\xa0 I got a lot of questions this week on whether or not the President enjoys being out on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 I think that seeing him at some of these fundraisers, you know the answer to the question.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s clearly having a good time talking directly with the American people about the choice that\'s before them this November when it comes to the midterm elections. And he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of hard work to do this year, but he does look forward to the time that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be able to spend with his family.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brennan is going with him tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be more campaign trips like this one after his vacation?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes. (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything locked in yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Nothing locked in that I know of.\xc2\xa0 I know they\xe2\x80\x99re still putting together the schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I heard you say earlier nothing tomorrow morning before leaving?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s no events tomorrow before leaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Florida, is the President going to sort of put to rest any of the questions about whether or not the White House is fully behind Kendrick Meek at this event?\xc2\xa0 What kind of things are we going to hear from him there? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t control whether or not people ask questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong and unwavering support for Kendrick Meak.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said that he is his candidate. Florida Democrats know that he is his candidate.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been down there. He\xe2\x80\x99s raised money for the Florida Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s introduced Meek at events as the next United States senator from the state.\xc2\xa0 So given all that, I don\'t know that people will stop asking questions regardless of what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Kendrick Meek will be involved in the event today and you will hear from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys envision this as the President\xe2\x80\x99s, like, full embrace of Kendrick Meek?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done something like this for him before.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President has fully embraced Kendrick Meek.\xc2\xa0 We envision this as going down and helping out Florida Democrats.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about the parent company to Fox News donating to the Republican Governors Association?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President is raising money for governors on this trip.\xc2\xa0 You guys have obviously had back-and-forth with Fox News.\xc2\xa0 And their reasoning for donating is -- insinuates that Democrats are anti-business, which is something that the President has been talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it creates a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the report, but I don\'t have any particular comment on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on the fundraiser tonight?\xc2\xa0 Is it all going to Sink, or is it being split --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s being split by -- but you should check that with the contact I gave you for Florida.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there will be nothing on Cuba? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAll right?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reading list for us? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He has not decided yet what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seriously?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could make some recommendations?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I sure could.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Have you written a book?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, everybody take a seat and buckle in. <br/>\n<br/>\nEND<br/>\n2:37 P.M.
