Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  2:08 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, now that we\'ve had the main event, let\'s get to the more mundane topics like whatever you all want to ask about today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Clinton\'s trip to North Korea, is it fair and accurate to say that President Obama supports this move?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Phil, we put out a statement this morning -- I put out a statement that this was a private mission that we weren\'t going to comment on while the former President was on the ground in North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of that I don\'t have anything more to add on this at this time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can understand why people could see this as a possible opening for further discussions with North Korea.\xc2\xa0 You understand why that\'s there.\xc2\xa0 Is the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can understand a lot.\xc2\xa0 Again --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we over-jumping that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This obviously is a very sensitive topic.\xc2\xa0 We will hope to provide some more detail at a later point.\xc2\xa0 Our focus right now is on ensuring the safety of two journalists that are in North Korea right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Then I\'m going to be selfish and take a second question then.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s more like your third, but go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It appears the unemployment rate, where the President is going tomorrow in Indiana, has actually worsened since the last time the President was there.\xc2\xa0 Why is the White House going there and what do you hope to accomplish with the trip?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the unemployment rate has gotten worse in Elkhart since the President was there in February.\xc2\xa0 It\'s gotten -- I think you could probably count on one or two hands the places where the unemployment rate has improved in those few months.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously we have seen -- and you saw this in the GDP figures -- a tremendous downturn in our economy over the past many quarters.\xc2\xa0 You saw a revision of even quarters where there was some modest growth, now there was a decline in the economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President will use this event, and a number of Cabinet Secretaries and the Vice President will use tomorrow\'s events, to make some announcements on battery technology, electric battery technology and capability in cars, and we\'ll have some more information on that later today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But obviously this is an area of the country that\'s been particularly hard-hit as a result of the economic downturn.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got a city that relied heavily on the manufacture and production of RVs.\xc2\xa0 Obviously in a severe economic downturn like this, you\'ve seen, as you have in the automobile market, tremendous pullback in demand for these.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So the President, I think, will not just make this particular announcement about recovery dollars, but talk about what we\'re seeing more broadly in the economy, and some ways that we -- some innovative ways that we can address creating jobs over the long term.\xc2\xa0 I think, as we\'ve said before, I think the unemployment rate is likely to get worse on Friday when the new economic figures come out.\xc2\xa0 We have seen some good signs.\xc2\xa0 The GDP figures from last Friday, I think, are certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President will use the occasion to discuss the steps that have been taken to pull the economy back from the brink and to lay out what he\'s continuing to work on in order to get the economy back on track.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And obviously the people in Elkhart know firsthand what the economic -- the type of economic devastation that this country has seen over the past many, many months.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at -- if you go back and look at those -- don\'t just look at the economic figures since the last time the President was there.\xc2\xa0 If you go back a year or so, you\'ve got an unemployment rate in the 5 and 6 percent.\xc2\xa0 I think, if I\'m not mistaken, the unemployment rate in Elkhart is somewhere between 16 and 17 percent right now.\xc2\xa0 You see the degree to which the economy has slid in only a very short period of time, and I think that\'s what the President will focus on tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions -- one on North Korea and one on Iran.\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to take North Korea from a slightly different angle.\xc2\xa0 The President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good try.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Former President Clinton is there, a very high-ranking former U.S. official.\xc2\xa0 Some analysts are saying that his mere presence there can be seen as a reward for bad behavior, and that\'s something that President Obama has made clear that he does not want to do in dealings with Pyongyang.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your -- what\'s the administration view on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get deep into this issue at this point, like I said to Phil.\xc2\xa0 I do think we have looked at -- as I said a few months ago, we\'re not equating -- we look at detainment and other issues separately.\xc2\xa0 We always hope that the North Koreans would look at it the same way.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how this administration has approached this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to keep those completely de-linked as issues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we talked about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iran, President Ahmadinejad will be sworn in tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Some of the U.S. allies will be sending representatives to attend that ceremony.\xc2\xa0 The administration is not.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. absence in any way indicate that it is not, shall we say, does not recognize the legitimacy of Ahmadinejad\'s reelection?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- let me get some larger guidance on our participation.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we have said throughout this that this was a decision and a debate that was ongoing in Iran by Iranians.\xc2\xa0 That they were going to choose their leadership.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President has discussed our goals for reaching out in order to ensure that they don\'t develop a nuclear weapons program.\xc2\xa0 Those continue to be our goals.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the administration recognize Ahmadinejad as the legitimate President in Iran?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s the elected leader.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 One, is it your contention -- is it the White House contention that the anger that some members of Congress are experiencing at town hall meetings, especially over health care reform, is manufactured?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think some of it is, yes.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think you\'ve had groups today, Conservatives for Patients\' Rights that have bragged about organizing and manufacturing that anger.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is their organizing and getting people to come to town hall meetings and express their feelings any different from a liberal group doing the same thing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you\'ve seen is they have bragged about manufacturing to some degree that anger.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve got somebody who\'s very involved, a leader of that group that\'s very involved in the status quo, a CEO that used to run a health care company that was fined by the federal government $1.7 billion for fraud.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a lot of what you need to know about the motives of that group.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And AIPAC just issued a statement saying they\'re deeply disappointed by the Obama administration\'s choice to award a Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary Robinson, and they respectfully call on the administration to firmly, fully, and publicly repudiate her views on Israel and her long-public record of hostility and one-sided bias against the Jewish state.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any comment about that or any other protest you\'ve heard from Jewish groups?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Mary Robinson was the first female President of Ireland, and she is somebody whom we are honoring as a prominent crusader of women\'s rights in Ireland and throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 There are statements that obviously she has made that the President doesn\'t agree with and that\'s probably true for a number of the people that the President is recognizing for their lifetime contributions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, I know you said that you don\'t want to get too deep into it, but can you at least tell us how is the White House, or how is President Obama getting updates on negotiations if this is a private mission?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will hopefully be freer to talk about some of this stuff later on.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\'t even tell us who it is that -- I mean, is it the National Security Advisor?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the North Koreans say that they got an informal message from the President.\xc2\xa0 Can you at least say whether that was the case or not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I spoke to that this morning and said that wasn\'t true.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Written or oral?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Written or oral.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was the last time President Obama spoke with President Clinton?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the last time they spoke was when former President Clinton visited the White House in March, I believe.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They haven\'t spoken since then?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the relationship like?\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the relationship?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they have a very good relationship.\xc2\xa0 I think they -- look, President and former President is a pretty small club.\xc2\xa0 There aren\'t many who have done that job who understand the pressures and the issues that confront a chief executive.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they talked during the campaign some and have talked a couple of times since he\'s been in here.\xc2\xa0 But as I said to Chuck, not since he visited a few months ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the meeting with the Democratic senators, some of those senators made it sound like there was nothing but happy talk in there -- a symphony, as it was described --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coach Lombardi -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t disagree.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there disagreements in there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the luncheon.\xc2\xa0 I know that there were basically two primary topics that were discussed at some length:\xc2\xa0 all that had been accomplished over the course of the first six-and-a-half months and particularly, as I just talked about a minute ago, in pulling back from the edge of an economic depression and the importance of continuing to work together to ensure that we get a strong health care reform bill to the President\'s desk by the end of the year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve been asked this before, but I just want to see if there\'s any update.\xc2\xa0 There still are a lot of Democrats up there saying we want more information, more details from the President on what he wants in this bill.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Harry Reid answered this at the stakeout by saying he talks to the people at the White House two or three times a day on this subject.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the President hasn\'t publicly said, here\'s what I want in this bill.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very clear about the principles that he sees involved in health care reform and we\'re very comfortable with where we are.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any change at all on the part of the discussion --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 Josh Earnest was in there; I can check with him and see to what degree that came up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick one on Cash for Clunkers.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the status on releasing sales data that Ray LaHood has said that the administration --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we released some -- I need to check with the guys on the economic team.\xc2\xa0 I know we released -- the figures that I released yesterday were sales data through, I believe, Saturday or Sunday.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know what the status is on the rest of it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration releasing it as fast as it can, as fast as it gets it?\xc2\xa0 Or are you holding that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re focusing first on -- you know, the way the program works is dealers give, based on the mileage difference in what you\'re trading in -- whether you qualify for a $3,500 or a $4,500 rebate.\xc2\xa0 So dealers are out there making those commitments, filing the certificates.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to process those as quickly as possible and ensure that car dealers get that money that they\'re forwarding on as rebates.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll certainly provide the information that we can in a timely basis.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the interest of transparency why did you allow the North Koreans to announce this trip?\xc2\xa0 We know that Clinton didn\'t sneak across the border.\xc2\xa0 Why did they announce it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think he went hiking and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or did he?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\'t this an opening now with the relations with --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, Helen, I don\'t want to belabor this, but I am hopeful that at a later point we can have a more fulsome conversation on this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say "later" -- today?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you have an idea, is it today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just not going to get into that right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when you have information you guys are going to -- pretty quickly?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about if we talk about a part that\'s already over?\xc2\xa0 What parameters were provided to President Clinton before he left?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nice try.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Elkhart, obviously today you had a pep talk a little bit it sounded like with the Senate Democrats -- that\'s what they described it as, a pep talk.\xc2\xa0 How much of tomorrow is a pep talk -- to Elkhart you\'re bringing some largesse, you\'re bringing some stimulus dollars -- and how much of it is sort of a reality check -- hey, this is what we can do, but this is what it\'s going to take, it\'s going to take a while to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, the President has always discussed the fact that this was going to take a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 You know, if you look back at -- you\'ve got a recession that started in December of 2007, which I don\'t know how many months, that\'s, what, 21 months ago.\xc2\xa0 So we didn\'t get here over the course of a couple month period of time.\xc2\xa0 And let\'s understand that many communities in the Midwest, some of whom are dependent upon auto manufacturing, part supplying, general manufacturing, felt job loss certainly dating back well before December of 2007.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think the President will bring -- continue to bring the message that he has, that it is going to take some time to move away from where we are, to get our economy back on track.\xc2\xa0 The President won\'t be satisfied until we\'re creating jobs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think if you look at where we were in January, what we now know was happening to economic output, measured by GDP, we certainly discussed in this room not just jobs but we discussed economic output, we discussed financial stability, we discussed regulatory reform, we discussed housing foreclosures, and I think -- I do think if you look at -- certainly nobody predicted that we would be standing here today, providing that almost every bank that is part of the TARP program got funding not from additional public sources but through the raising of private capital.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We are on pace to, by November, modify the mortgages of half a million Americans that need help as part of the home affordability program.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to -- we\'ve seen some progress that the economy has not retracted at nearly the pace that it was just a quarter ago.\xc2\xa0 But it will be quite some time before we add jobs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it the President\'s responsibility to tell a community like that, you know what, these jobs aren\'t coming back?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President\'s responsibility is to talk about all the things that we\'re doing to lay the foundation for job growth and to lay the foundation for continued economic success in this country.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has always understood -- and he\'s believed this a lot longer than some of us have -- that it\'s important to be upfront and straight with the American people about where we are, about where we need to go, and some of the decisions that we\'re going to have to make to put our country back on that secure economic footing.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s some of what he\'ll do tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on North Korea, I think everybody understands the sensitivity of this issue, given the personal stakes.\xc2\xa0 But there is the geopolitics overlay to this.\xc2\xa0 At what point is the White House -- and under what circumstances will the White House be willing to share with the American public what is happening?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When we feel comfortable doing so.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When would that be?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- my statement made mention of the fact that we weren\'t going to talk about this while former President Clinton was in North Korea.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it your expectation, Robert, that he will leave North Korea with the two American journalists?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to prejudge the outcome of the trip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the fate of the two American journalists and your ability to talk about this more openly, publicly, linked?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to ensure that I don\'t do or the administration doesn\'t do anything that would jeopardize that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would you believe that speaking about this trip would in any way jeopardize or enhance their ability to be released?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Safety is the best policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The BBC is actually reporting that the two journalists have been released to Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Surprisingly no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I carry on, Robert, on Cash for Clunkers?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'m sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ask a stupid question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to put it under the umbrella of North Korea.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where does the administration believe the $2 billion should come from within the stimulus package?\xc2\xa0 Does it have a preference?\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of energy-related --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I owe this to Jon Ward, the House -- I need to look up the legislation and I\'ll get it for Jon and for you, as well.\xc2\xa0 The money comes from an energy efficiency program previously approved --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the House legislation states.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the administration supports and that\'s where it should come?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration categorically reject the notion that this money could in any way, shape, or form come from the TARP allocations?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In order for that to happen you\'d have to have -- you couldn\'t do that without a change in the law or the approval of Congress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It couldn\'t be done by Friday, therefore you oppose it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, right, with the House out of town.\xc2\xa0 But it could not be done unilaterally.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So therefore you oppose it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Makes it more difficult to effectualize. (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How comfortable is the administration with the statistics released so far?\xc2\xa0 I know these are incomplete because DOD hasn\'t released all the available data.\xc2\xa0 But based on what we know so far, four of the five top-selling models come from Toyota and Honda.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the statistics that I had mentioned yesterday, I mean, 47 percent of the cars sold were from the Big Three, which was slightly larger than their current market share of 45 percent.\xc2\xa0 And I think the top-selling car through this program is the Ford Focus.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think what you\'ve seen is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are comfortable?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re comfortable because what we\'ve seen is, one, people are making decisions to buy cars for the first time in a long time.\xc2\xa0 And two, this program is also designed to take cars that get far worse gas mileage, which pollute more, off of the road for something that\'s more fuel-efficient, safer for our environment, and protects our security.\xc2\xa0 I think the statistics that we have show a 61 percent increase in fuel mileage, which lets people know the program is working.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Betty Sutton\'s original legislation sought a "Buy America" provision.\xc2\xa0 It was dropped in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember this ever coming up in the briefings previously -- if it did, I apologize -- did the administration actively seek the removal of that "Buy America" provision?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 I know that some of those provisions, as I\'ve talked about in some of the questions on this in the morning, there was concern about violating international trade.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 True.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s concerns about that in defense appropriations legislation, as well, and there are "Buy America" provisions in some defense contracting legislation that balance both these issues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the statistics denote that the Big Three automakers have been represented well in this program because they\'re building cars that Americans want to buy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you tell us a little more about the lunch, kind of the form -- were there questions offered by the senators?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me get a -- we\'ll provide a little bit further readout.\xc2\xa0 But I know the President did a little Q&amp;A after they ate, and then they discussed a number of topics.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more information on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if I could go back to something you said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We were talking about the deficit and you said obviously we were going to have to make some decisions down the road on some of the President\'s legislative priorities and some of the things Congress wants to do, evaluate how we move back on a path towards fiscal sustainability.\xc2\xa0 What are we talking about here?\xc2\xa0 Could you elaborate about what legislative priorities the President might be willing to talk about down the road?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I didn\'t have anything specific in mind except to say, obviously -- as we\'ve discussed much in this room -- we have big structural deficits that are going to be -- that if we\'re going to be serious about fiscal responsibility have to be looked at.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to mean we\'re probably not going to be able to continue -- we\'re not going to be able to continue to spend like we always have.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has talked about throughout the campaign and his time here being serious about getting our fiscal house in order and making cuts in our budget.</div> <div class="legacy-para">That\'s what in many ways led the President to -- with Senators Levin and McCain, with the backing of Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs -- to go after the additional F-22 plane money that the Pentagon said wasn\'t needed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the type of thing that -- the type of vote that we\'re going to have to work through in order to make some of these tough decisions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that F-22 was not, of course, one of President Obama\'s legislative priorities.\xc2\xa0 Are there things of his own he\'d be willing to give up if the tax cut, for instance, you put in the stimulus is only a two-year --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a two-year --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- temporary thing.\xc2\xa0 Is that something he would give up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get ahead two years ahead of the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 Again, our focus in terms of that tax cut, one, is to finally put some money back in the pockets of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I talked yesterday about the fact that for a long, long time the middle class has borne the brunt of some bad economic decisions.\xc2\xa0 Throughout many years, even while the economy grew, wages declined.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one of the reasons the President sought to run for this office, to protect those hard-working, middle-class Americans.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But, look, I think the President -- the President is aware and understands, and will -- understands that we\'re going to have to take some action in order to get the deficit under control.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question on this, sorry.\xc2\xa0 You said we should have this conversation down the road.\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\'t people think about that now so they can understand the tradeoffs when they are talking about all these different big expenditures that you\'re talking about putting the country on?\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\'t we be able to have a debate about which of these things is a priority that they want to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think in some ways we\'re having those debates right now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'re having --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get -- we\'ll have tradeoffs, even though --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but I think we\'re talking -- I think when we talk about the priority of health care, I think there are those debates.\xc2\xa0 I think there have certainly been those that argued we didn\'t need to stimulate our economy, or we didn\'t need to stimulate our economy to the degree to which we stimulated it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">It\'s hard for me to get, though, to this point, Peter, without mentioning that we got to this point after many, many years, and we got to this point with the President walking into office with a budget deficit that exceeded, or is headed north of a trillion-and-a-half dollars.\xc2\xa0 He understands he was elected to make decisions to get our fiscal house back in order.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clarify the manufactured outrage issue, because this morning you said it was pretty -- just manufactured outrage, full stop.\xc2\xa0 And then when Jake asked you about it, you said that some of it is manufactured.\xc2\xa0 So --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I -- well, go ahead, ask your question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean there\'s a difference between -- or maybe there\'s different levels of orchestration or manufacturing, because if they\'re busing people in and planting people at these rallies, that\'s one level.\xc2\xa0 And if they\'re posting a list on their Web site, a D.C. organization, and people from that area are going to the rally, that\'s orchestrated to a degree, but it\'s far more authentic in an organic sense.\xc2\xa0 So what do you guys think is happening here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t doubt that there are people that come to ask their members of Congress honest questions about the direction of the country.\xc2\xa0 I also have no doubt that there are groups that have spread out people across the country to go to these things and to specifically generate videos that can be posted on Internet sites, so that people can watch what\'s happening in America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not calling all of this emotion on the videos that were -- you\'re not saying that all of it is feigned or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I\'m not calling all of it.\xc2\xa0 I think there is no doubt that there\'s some of it.\xc2\xa0 I think some of it is\xc2\xa0 genuine, I think some of it -- I think we\'ve all seen videos over the past couple of days that leave you somewhat speechless.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you -- what is the White House doing to counter this effort?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, most of all, I think the President would tell any of his friends or supporters that go to town hall meetings that first and foremost we can disagree -- as you heard him say, we can disagree without being disagreeable, and that we can have a debate in this country that affords those that disagree with us the respect that each and every one of them deserve.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Robert, what about the videos that leaves the White House speechless?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll point you out a few videos.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, regarding your commendable statement yesterday, and I quote --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "We\'re already looking at ways to cut wasteful spending."\xc2\xa0 First, can you name any other President in history who had in the old and new media offices 66 staffers who were paid $4 million a year, as reported by Accuracy In Media?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what list you\'re talking about, Lester.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, 66 --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that there are hardworking members that respond to questions throughout the political spectrum each and every day in a quest for information that provide your listeners with only the most accurate information possible, including maintaining a Web site that millions of Americans go to, to get information on from things like recovery dollars to H1N1.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since -- Canada\'s Free Press reports the First Lady\'s staff of 21 costs the taxpayers $1,256,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 Has there ever before been such a First Lady expense, to your knowledge?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I only play a reporter on TV.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that WorldNetDaily has afforded you either a calculator or some sort of abacus that could figure out the same information you\'re asking me.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 This is sort of a follow-up from the tax discussion yesterday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You said "sort of a follow-up," be careful.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You funny man.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, from yesterday, but not exactly to belabor the point about the middle-class tax cut, but the President has talked about -- during his campaign also -- about --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My mom wouldn\'t think so -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Go ahead, I\'m sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President had talked about during the campaign about middle-class tax cuts, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And during the stimulus bill, there were reports -- the Make Work Pay tax credits.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be the extent of middle-class tax cuts?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that, for this budget year, obviously -- and understand it\'s a two-year program for middle-class tax cuts for 95 percent of working Americans, as the President campaigned on for two years.</div> <div class="legacy-para">It was important because as I said earlier, we\'ve got a middle class that for years and years watched the benefits of a growing economy accrue to people other than them.\xc2\xa0 They didn\'t just see their wages flat line; they saw their wages decline.\xc2\xa0 The President believed it was important to protect those middle-class families and to put money directly back into their pockets.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he thought is important and that\'s what he\'s done.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At some point in the legislative process will the President read the entire health care bill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume the President will study the details of the proposal, and will be -- he\'s a highly informed individual.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he won\'t take time to read it front to back --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what his vacation plans are currently.\xc2\xa0 Will you read the health care bill cover to cover?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 Well, great.\xc2\xa0 I\'m right up the hall to the left.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, back on Bill Clinton, how does this administration view Bill Clinton beyond being President?\xc2\xa0 How does this administration view him?\xc2\xa0 What -- who is he, in your opinion?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond him being a President.\xc2\xa0 No, this is a serious question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I feel like I should be lying down for this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I described I think they have a very good relationship.\xc2\xa0 They have, as I talked about, they have -- very few people have done this.\xc2\xa0 Very few people have the type of direct knowledge --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t ask about the relationship with the President.\xc2\xa0 I asked how does the administration view Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Who is he to this administration?\xc2\xa0 Who does he -- who -- what does he represent to you?\xc2\xa0 Who is he?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s the 42nd President of the United States.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you know where I\'m going.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, honestly, April, I\'ve got to tell you, I don\'t have the slightest idea.\xc2\xa0 We have tremendous respect for what President Clinton accomplished in eight years in office.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are people that worked for him that now work for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 He\'s somebody that the President has talked to and asked advice from, and somebody who the President believes contributed enormously to the security of the middle class, to making our country safer, and to accomplishing things stretching from a strong economy to providing children with health care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, okay, what\'s the benefit of a private citizen --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, what is the benefit -- let me finish, let me finish, then shoot me down, okay?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the benefit of a private citizen going to talk to a country like North Korea or Iran?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in the past, other Presidents have dealt with this issue with private citizens to try to hold communication with other countries that this country is not friendly with.\xc2\xa0 What is the benefit of a private citizen\'s conversation with another country like those countries I mentioned?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I shoot it down now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shoot it down.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get it out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I never doubted you would.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into this at this point.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I hope to be able to do so soon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.
