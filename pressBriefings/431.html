Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:47 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Apologize for keeping you waiting a little bit this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 There is a presidential event scheduled for a little later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 The President is also running a little behind schedule.\xc2\xa0 But if you do feel like you need to leave the briefing early in order to cover the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, I will not take personal offense at your early departure.</p>\n<p>With that, Jim, would you like to get us started today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. determined who was responsible for the U.N. school strike?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, what I can tell you is that the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, said yesterday that \xe2\x80\x9cAll available evidence points to Israeli artillery as the cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He further said the coordinates of the school, like all U.N. facilities in Gaza, were repeatedly communicated to Israeli Defense Forces.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Rights and Works Agency Commissioner General said that UNWRA has gathered evidence, analyzed fragments and examined craters, and their initial assessment is that it was Israeli artillery that hit the school in which 3,300 people had sought refuge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Israeli government has acknowledged that Israeli forces were firing in that area in response to fire from Hamas in the immediate vicinity of the school.\xc2\xa0 The Israelis have said it is possible that there was stray Israeli fire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So while we underscore the importance of a full and prompt investigation of this tragic incident, as well as the shelling of other U.N. facilities and schools that have been hit, it does not appear there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of doubt about whose artillery was involved in this incident.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have continued to urge Israeli military officials to live up to their high standards that they have set for the protection of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 There is clearly more that can and should be done to ensure the safety of innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you do not dispute the U.N. determination on this thing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any evidence that would contradict what both U.N. officials and Israelis officials are saying about this incident.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another point, does the President agree that the tunnels that Hamas has used to transport or hide armaments should be destroyed and be part of any cease-fire agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we have said -- this goes to the broader discussion about demilitarizing Gaza, and there have been some discussions about the proper way to do that.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that an immediate cease-fire is what\xe2\x80\x99s most important; that as the violence continues in a very active way, it puts at risk innocent civilians on both sides of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And trying to put in place a cease-fire, working with the international community, would provide greater protection for those innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe should be the focus.</p>\n<p>Now, once that cease-fire is in place, we certainly would play a role in facilitating conversations among the parties that would involve discussion about demilitarizing Gaza and ensuring that rockets cannot be launched from Gaza, aimed squarely at innocent civilians, and that these tunnels that have been used to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians and Israeli military on the Israeli side of the border are also dealt with as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a cease-fire first, and then deal with demilitarizing.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Palestinian-American teenager -- I believe his name is Mohamed Abu Nie -- who\xe2\x80\x99s been in Israeli custody for three weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I wondered if the White House has raised this issue directly with Israel, Israeli officials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations about that to read you in on at this point.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what is the status of efforts to get a cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that Secretary Kerry has been actively engaged in.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any thoughts right now about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a lot of discussions that are ongoing between U.S. officials and Israeli and Palestinians leaders.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the U.N. is closely involved in this.\xc2\xa0 There are also regional players that have a role in bringing both sides to the table in trying to facilitate an agreement between the parties who are in conflict here.\xc2\xa0 So there is an active effort that continues to be underway on this.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry continues to be intimately involved in those conversations, even as he\xe2\x80\x99s on the road, to deal with other important United States security measures.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Israelis are talking about a long campaign.\xc2\xa0 Are you resigned to that, that it being a long campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We believe that it is in the clear interest of both sides in this conflict for there to be an immediate cease-fire reinstated along the lines of the November 2012 agreement that was reached and brought an end to some hostilities.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the interest of both sides, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we are urging both sides to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just separately, lastly, Speaker Boehner says if the President takes further unilateral actions, he will be \xe2\x80\x9csealing the deal\xe2\x80\x9d on his \xe2\x80\x9clawlessness.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity to watch what apparently was a rather colorful news conference that was convened by the Speaker today.\xc2\xa0 I will say that this President has repeatedly put forward specific proposals that deserve, and in some cases have already earned, bipartisan support to make progress on behalf of middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 The best example of that is the proposal that this President put forward for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out principles in January of 2013 about what comprehensive immigration reform should look like, so we could maximize the economic benefits of that reform in the form of creating jobs and expanding economic opportunity, and addressing so many other problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>Democrats and Republicans in the Senate side hammered out an agreement after a couple of months of negotiations, and eventually passed a piece of legislation with strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is legislation that the CBO has found would reduce the deficit, create jobs, expand economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But for more than a year, Speaker Boehner and his colleagues in the House Republican conference have actively blocked that legislation from coming to the House floor for a vote.\xc2\xa0 The reason they have blocked that legislation is because they know that if it were -- if a vote were convened on this measure, it would pass, and it would pass with bipartisan support in the same way that it passed with bipartisan support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we have not been shy about expressing our frustration about that.\xc2\xa0 We have also been pretty candid about the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination, even in the face of this congressional obstruction, to make progress on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President use the executive authority that\xe2\x80\x99s codified in the law for any President of the United States to try to push our policy and a policy that benefits middle-class families forward.\xc2\xa0 And the Republican commitment to keep in place the wall that is preventing the comprehensive immigration reform bill from coming up for a vote is why the President is considering measures that he could take on his own to try to address some of these problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about what that action would look like, but it will be consistent with the proposal that was put forward by Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that is supported by business leaders and labor leaders, leaders in the faith community, and even law enforcement leaders across the country about the benefits it would have for communities across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the President can\xe2\x80\x99t do as much as Congress could do in terms of addressing some of these problems.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to figure out what exactly the law will allow the President to do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do as much as possible within the confines of the law to address a problem whose solution Republicans in Congress continue to actively block.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So while we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a cease-fire in the Middle East, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from a number of people in the administration now that Israel could do more, so how could they do more at this point, exactly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have steadfastly defended the right of the Israeli government and Israeli military leaders to take the actions that they feel are necessary to protect their people and to defend their country.\xc2\xa0 The steps that they have taken have also been taken with the standards that they put in place to protect the lives of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 That stands in pretty stark contrast to the approach that\xe2\x80\x99s adopted by Hamas, that is actually using their military might to target innocent Israeli civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we have said is that Israel clearly -- based on published reports about the significant, tragic loss of life experienced by innocent Palestinian civilians -- is that the Israeli military can and should do more to protect the lives of those innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 So there is a difference in approach between what Hamas is perpetrating on the Israeli people and what Israel is doing to defend their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the shelling of a U.N. facility that is housing innocent civilians who are fleeing violence is totally unacceptable and totally indefensible.\xc2\xa0 And it is clear that we need our allies in Israel to do more to live up to the high standards that they have set for themselves.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel the method of attack is not as precise as maybe many believed going in?\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. continuing to supply them with more ammunition, does that raise concerns in the administration right now?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that the weaponry is not precise?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the concerns that we have expressed are with the specific military decisions made by the Israeli military -- that they have put in place high standards that ensure that they are taking steps to protect innocent civilians who may be caught in the cross-fire.\xc2\xa0 And the observation that I think many across the globe have made is that there are, despite those standards, that there are innocent Palestinian lives that are being lost.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The loss of those lives, the lives of innocent Palestinians, is tragic.\xc2\xa0 The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the lives -- are with the families of those who have been lost in this terrible conflict.\xc2\xa0 And what we are simply asking the Israelis to do and, in fact, urging the Israelis to do, is to do more to live up to the standards that they have set for their own military operations to protect the lives of innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on Ebola, I know that there have been high-level talks to do something about possibly bringing Americans or workers that have been exposed out of there.\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss that a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can confirm for you, Michelle, that the State Department and the CDC are working to facilitate options for potential medevacs for U.S. patients, specifically American citizen humanitarian workers.\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that humanitarian aid workers from the United States in West Africa have contracted the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to talk about individual cases, but these kinds of medevacs would be consistent with -- well, let me point out one other thing.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of medevacs that are performed by private entities, by private organizations, yet facilitated by the U.S. government and government agencies is consistent with what has been done in similar situations in the past.</p>\n<p>In 2003, there were reports of American citizens overseas who had contracted SARS, and the U.S. government facilitated the private transportation of those patients back to the U.S. so that they could benefit from our modern medical infrastructure and have access to the kind of technology that could render lifesaving aid to them.</p>\n<p>In 2007, there were Americans overseas who were at risk of contracting drug-resistant tuberculosis.\xc2\xa0 Again, those individuals were transported through private means, but yet in a manner that was facilitated by the U.S. government to return to the U.S. where they could get treatment.</p>\n<p>So there are conversations underway about doing something similar in this situation to ensure that these American humanitarian aid workers who are currently in Africa can be returned to the U.S. in a way that -- so that they can have access to modern medical facilities and technologies that would allow them to get access to potentially lifesaving aid.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we say that this is going happen?\xc2\xa0 We just are looking at -- we don\'t know the timeline yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to confirm it.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the CDC on this.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s one other piece of this that is important for you to understand, and this goes to an assessment that was reached by the CDC.\xc2\xa0 The CDC has concluded that there is no significant risk in the United States from the current Ebola outbreak.\xc2\xa0 And while it is unlikely that the disease would spread if the virus were detected in the United States, the CDC is taking action to alert health care workers in the U.S. and remind them how to isolate and test suspected patients while following strict infection control procedures.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a quick follow-up on Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that this could affect anything regarding the upcoming Africa summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, there are no plans in place to alter the schedule in any way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And a question, which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to ask -- it actually happened last week -- but General Flynn, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, made some comment out at the Aspen Forum about -- suggesting that we are less safe now than we were five years ago.\xc2\xa0 The exact question he was asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we safer today than we were two, five, 10 years ago?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment on that?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And his answer was, \xe2\x80\x9c[Yeah], my quick answer is [that] we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 My expanded answer is we understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re not, and we are working to organize ourselves better.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is, does the White House agree with that assessment that we are less safe now than we were two, five or 10 years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I didn\'t see his full comments, so I don\'t want to comment directly on them.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that there are very important steps that this administration has taken.\xc2\xa0 And thanks to the service of our men and women in the intelligence community and our men and woman in the military, that there have been very devastating blows that have been leveled against al Qaeda, particularly core al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>What is beyond debate is that prior to 2001, core al Qaeda was operating in a virtual vacuum in the area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and used that area that was essentially lawless as a base of operations to launch a horrific attack against the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since that time, members of the military, members of the intelligence community and others have worked to mitigate that threat, and, in fact, decimated the core al Qaeda leadership that previously was operating with impunity in that area.</p>\n<p>However, what we continue to face are elements that are either sympathetic to al Qaeda, or associate themselves with the ideology of al Qaeda in other remote areas of the world that do pose a threat to the United States and our interests and our allies.\xc2\xa0 And this administration has kept up a very aggressive pace of trying to counter that threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have done that in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that by working with our partners around the globe, our allies around the globe to counter that threat.\xc2\xa0 There are intelligence-sharing and national security agreements that we have with these other countries to mitigate that threat.\xc2\xa0 And this President considers it to be his very top priority to ensure the safety and security of the American people here at home, but also all across the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom-line assessment?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that we are less safe now than we were five years ago?\xc2\xa0 Or are you suggesting that that\'s not correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to respond directly to his comments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to the question generally, are we less safe now, or are we more safe now than we were five years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we are is we are in a position where we have made significant gains over the last decade or so against al Qaeda elements that previously operated with impunity in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and used that area to launch terrible attacks against the American people.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made tremendous progress along those lines.</p>\n<p>The threat from other affiliated organizations around the globe continues to exist.\xc2\xa0 And this administration is working literally around the clock to mitigate those threats, to counter those threats, in some cases to bring those terrorists to justice.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on that is incredibly strong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just one last thing on the Congress leaving town.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out and we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, a five-week recess.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Actually, somebody told me today that they\'re returning on September 8th.\xc2\xa0 So it may even be longer than five weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So should we go six weeks?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you this before, but now that the jet fumes can be smelled, will the President call on Congress to stay until they can get their work done to delay this recess, to deal with specifically the border crisis issue?\xc2\xa0 There was a whole long list of things that they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving without finishing up.\xc2\xa0 So will the President say, hey, Congress should stick around until it gets its work done?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, unfortunately, Jon, I think we have seen that Congress being in Washington, D.C. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually guarantee they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do any additional work.\xc2\xa0 So I think their record speaks for itself in terms of this Congress\xe2\x80\x99s record.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives has demonstrated an inability to do very much, particularly when it\xe2\x80\x99s related to the priorities that are shared by middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Again, it was pretty disappointing that in the very limited time remaining, that House Republicans were focused on passing legislation authorizing them to file a lawsuit against the President merely for doing his job.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we would have been much more happy -- and I think the American people would have been happier -- to see Republicans focused on legislation that would raise the minimum wage or guarantee access to equal pay for equal work.\xc2\xa0 It would make the cost of a college education more affordable, or even legislation that would solve so many of the problems caused by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Republicans were focused instead on political priorities rather than the priorities of the American people, and particularly American middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To sort of follow on that -- the House and Senate are still very far apart on the border supplemental, and they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously leaving town.\xc2\xa0 Can your agencies operate and handle this crisis with no money for the next five weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, there are already a number of steps that this administration has taken to add additional resources to the border and confront some of the challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing at the border right now.\xc2\xa0 This administration has shifted resources from the interior to the border.\xc2\xa0 We have surged some technology to allow immigration judges and other ICE prosecutors and asylum officials the opportunity to try to whittle down the bottleneck or the backlog of immigration cases that currently exists.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve prioritized the cases of recent border crossers to try to process those cases more efficiently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a number of things that this administration has done to try to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 There have also been some diplomatic efforts underway to try to address this problem at the source.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the Vice President traveled down there.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State traveled to Central America.\xc2\xa0 The President met with Central American leaders here at the White House just a week or two ago to talk about some of these issues.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned a week or two ago, we have actually seen some initially encouraging indications that the flow has receded somewhat; that in the month of June, that there were weeks that were averaging more than 300 individuals being apprehended at the border, children being apprehended at the border every day.\xc2\xa0 That flow has been cut in half, or even more.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are encouraged by that initial assessment.</p>\n<p>That said, because these numbers tend to fluctuate a lot, and there is some volatility in these numbers, we have continued to focus on this challenge.\xc2\xa0 And we are doing everything we can to try to stem the flow at the source; to process efficiently the cases of those who are currently going through the immigration system; and do the other kinds of things that will ensure that our border remains secure, that the law continues to be enforced, while at the same time we\xe2\x80\x99re ensuring that those individuals who are apprehended are treated in a humanitarian way and have access to the due process to which they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you still need that money, then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly would welcome Congress taking action on a request that we forwarded to them almost four weeks ago now.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that House Republicans have waited literally until the very last day of their session to even consider taking a vote on this is an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re not operating with the best interest of the American people in mind, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given what you just said and the fact that so many actions the administration has taken you believe have already helped the situation, does the White House believe perhaps it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need as much money as was in that original request?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The answer to that is, no.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that those resources are necessary, simply because we have seen in the past that these numbers can be pretty volatile.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged that the flow, at least for now, appears to have receded.\xc2\xa0 But we remain very focused and concerned on this situation, both because those numbers can be volatile, but also because those who have been apprehended have extended the backlog that already existed in our immigration court system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So working through that backlog and ensuring that we can enforce the law efficiently while ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re respecting the due process rights to which many of these individuals are entitled is a priority.\xc2\xa0 And we have been saying for weeks now that we need additional resources to address a problem that Republican members of Congress are eager to acknowledge is a problem on cable television, but when they get back to work in their congressional offices they\xe2\x80\x99re not really willing to take any action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the internal CIA report that suggests that indeed the CIA was spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the conversations on the Hill that John Brennan had with Dianne Feinstein and Saxby Chambliss?\xc2\xa0 Back in March, he said that when the facts come out a lot of people who are claiming there has been all this spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.\xc2\xa0 Given what this report says, and the fact that he went to the Hill and has apologized, does the President believe that there is a credibility issue for John Brennan there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, Director Brennan is the one who suggested that the inspector general investigate this situation in the first place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In response to that report, the CIA Public Affairs Office put out a statement in which they said that Director Brennan was briefed on the IG\xe2\x80\x99s findings, and noted that that finding included, \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment that some CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between the Senate Intelligence Committee and the CIA.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So Director Brennan is the one who suggested that this situation be investigated.\xc2\xa0 He supported the IG launching that investigation.\xc2\xa0 He now has been briefed on those results, has affirmed the conclusion that the employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between the CIA and the committee.\xc2\xa0 Director Brennan has taken the further step of appointing an accountability board to review this situation, review the conduct of these individuals who are involved, and if necessary ensure that they are properly held accountable for that conduct.\xc2\xa0 He has appointed somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work at the CIA, former Senator Evan Bayh, a member of the Senate Intel Committee, to lead that accountability board and to offer him some recommendations about steps that can be taken to ensure that these kind of misunderstandings don\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So Director Brennan has taken all of the kinds of responsible steps to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is Director Brennan is somebody who over the course of the last five and a half years has played an instrumental role in helping the President make the kinds of decisions that I mentioned to Jon earlier that have decimated the leadership of core al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And he currently is operating in a very difficult environment to ensure the safety of the American public.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who had a very difficult job who does that job extraordinarily well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no concern about the fact that he stated so certainly in March that this hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened?\xc2\xa0 Or any perception problems that may arise over the fact that obviously the President has a close relationship with him, that he was formerly, obviously, as you know, the NSC Deputy Director for Terrorism -- no action anticipated as a result of this disconnect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, Director Brennan has done what is necessary to get to the bottom of what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 He has been candid about the inconsistencies that the IG found, and he has taken the additional step of appointing somebody who does not work at the CIA to conduct a review, an accountability review of what exactly happened and to determine what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to hold those individuals accountable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of proactive leadership that the President would expect from somebody who has an important job like running the CIA.\xc2\xa0 And it in no way impacts any judgment on John Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s strong record of making the kinds of difficult decisions that are necessary to keep the American public safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, and is it accurate that it\xe2\x80\x99s an apology he\xe2\x80\x99s making today to the leaders of the Intelligence Committee?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of communication between the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the CIA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know if it\xe2\x80\x99s right that Senator Feinstein is here today to have a conversation with the President about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check -- that she is among those who is participating in the discussion that the President has convened with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill about a range of foreign policy matters in the Cabinet Room.\xc2\xa0 I know that some of you were actually in that room taking photographs of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I was not actually in that room.<br/>\n\tSo I believe Senator Feinstein was there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Your colleague confirms that Senator Feinstein was in the room for that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And so that was the reason that she\xe2\x80\x99s at the White House today.\xc2\xa0 I do not know whether or not she and the President will have the opportunity to discuss this specific issue.</p>\n<p>Julie.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come right back to you, Bill.\xc2\xa0 Julie, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to Ebola and the summit for a moment.\xc2\xa0 You said that you didn\'t anticipate any scheduling changes.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there are already three leaders who have pulled out of coming to the summit because of the health crisis in their countries.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is the White House anxious at all about the impact that this could have on the summit?\xc2\xa0 And at what point does the President become concerned that it could hinder the progress that he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to make in these meetings next week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly understand the decision that was made by some of these African leaders to not participate.\xc2\xa0 They obviously have some very pressing items and business to handle in their own countries.</p>\n<p>We certainly would have preferred that circumstances would allow them to attend and participate in what we think will be a very important conference for building the future of the relationship between the United States and nations in Africa.</p>\n<p>I understand that these nations, however, are planning to send delegations to participate in the conference and will allow them to get the benefit of being here and participating in this historic event.</p>\n<p>But again, I don\'t anticipate at this point that any scheduling changes will be required.\xc2\xa0 But if our assessment of that situation changes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly on the meeting that -- the foreign policy meeting with the Senate and House members -- or I guess not very many House members.\xc2\xa0 But what --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there were some more House members who were going to come, but they were delayed because of votes on the floor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was on the agenda?\xc2\xa0 What was the point of the meeting?\xc2\xa0 Did anything come out of -- what was the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to them on some of the world crises that he\xe2\x80\x99s facing and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking him about in recent days?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The goal of this meeting was to further the important and valuable consultative relationship that exists between the White House and Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have worked in close partnership with members of Congress, particularly those who -- a few relevant committees -- in pursuit of our foreign policy goals around the globe.\xc2\xa0 So this was intended to be a wide-ranging discussion of a range of issues.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re putting together a more formal readout of that meeting, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to issue it a little later this afternoon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, which leaders pulled out of the summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Check with the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s some of the countries that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about who -- where these reported cases of Ebola have occurred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the leaders -- you said the leaders pulled out because of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think that they did decide not to travel to the United States because they were attending to this important public health priority in their own country.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the CIA IG report, is there a draft of talking points circulating here at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Received a draft?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the AP story about the draft talking points that are reportedly circulating around the White House.\xc2\xa0 I think because they are still in their draft form I have not reviewed them.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also my understanding that this AP report is based on essentially an errant email that was inadvertently sent to a reporter.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of circumstances come up, frankly, on our side of the aisle and on your side of the aisle sometimes, too.\xc2\xa0 So it was unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any comment on any sort of draft of talking points that are reported, but I haven\'t seen them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, now that it\'s out there, you could email it to all of us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, soon enough you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the benefit of hearing me deliver the final version of those talking points -- probably in the next week or so, I would assume.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it true, as the draft apparently indicates, that the Secretary of State was not told about these various procedures at the time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I\'m just not in a position at this point to comment on the findings of a report that has not yet been declassified and has not yet been released by its authors on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Worth a try.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While that inadvertently emailed information was interesting and helpful to us at least, I\'m wondering what happened to the tougher standards you all were going to put in place after the inadvertent sending out of the name of a CIA official in Afghanistan earlier this year.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have put in place some difficult standards.\xc2\xa0 I think those are pretty -- two different scenarios. The information that you\'re referring to in that previous incident was related to classified information that had been improperly or inadvertently communicated to the media.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of steps that we have put in place, some corrective actions to ensure that kind of thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0 There will be more thorough vetting of those who participated in meetings with the President.\xc2\xa0 There will be more careful review of the list that was -- before it is publicized to the media.\xc2\xa0 So that will be a way for us to put in place some safeguards for protecting classified information, while at the same time living up to the record of transparency that we pride ourselves in.</p>\n<p>This situation is different.\xc2\xa0 It did not relate specifically to classified information.\xc2\xa0 It related specifically to the circulating of a draft document that I haven\'t yet seen and not in a position to talk about just yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody yet taken to the woodshed for pressing the send button?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think a mistake like that is something that we have all made in one form or another.\xc2\xa0 I think in this case it was somebody who had sent an inadvertent email, and it was a particularly sensitive piece of information that was circulating.\xc2\xa0 So, an unfortunate error, but an honest one.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how much was the timing of today\xe2\x80\x99s executive order a kind of in-your-face to John Boehner for yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s vote on suing the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the executive order that the President will be signing a little later this afternoon is a really important one.\xc2\xa0 It puts in place some additional protections for workers to ensure that they are paid fairly and they\xe2\x80\x99re not discriminated against because of their age or gender.\xc2\xa0 It also ensures that their workers are taking the necessary -- their employees are taking the next steps, the steps required to ensure that they are operating in a safe work environment.\xc2\xa0 And it will do this by holding federal contractors to a high standard for meeting basic labor law provisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about what it does.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the timing.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\'m saying is that we wanted to do this as soon as possible because it puts in place important protections for workers.\xc2\xa0 It also puts in place important protections for taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 This administration and this President promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 And we have found that there\xe2\x80\x99s actually correlation between federal contractors that don\'t do a good job of protecting basic worker rights, not living up to the performance standards of the contract that they\xe2\x80\x99ve signed.</p>\n<p>So this is an executive order that will put in place important protections for workers.\xc2\xa0 It will ensure that we are good stewards of taxpayer dollars when conducting the business of the American people.\xc2\xa0 We also are ensuring that we\'re not providing an incentive for employees -- or for federal contractors to cut corners.\xc2\xa0 Again, the vast majority of federal contractors actually do a good job of living up to these fair labor standards, and we want to make sure that those unscrupulous actors don\'t get a benefit for not looking out for their workers in the way they should.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on what it does -- you already said earlier today that you could help more people if Congress got involved and passed legislation.\xc2\xa0 Have you thought that you might be able to help more people than just people who work for federal contractors if you perhaps lowered your standards and compromised with Congress on broader legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Wendell, time and time again this administration has sought bipartisan compromise and in many cases even struck a bipartisan compromise with Republicans only to see it be thoroughly rejected by House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The best example of this is the common-sense immigration reform proposal that the Senate put forward.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out his principles on January 29, 2013.\xc2\xa0 He did that in a speech in Las Vegas that I believe many of you attended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Several months later, over the course of several months, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate sat down and hammered out an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We acknowledged at the time that that agreement was struck that it was a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t include every single thing that the President wanted, but it did broadly reflect the principles that the President had laid out.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we got 68 senators, including 14 or so Republicans, to vote for that piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are confident that Democrats and Republicans would vote for that legislation if they were given the opportunity to do so in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 That is exhibit A of the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to compromise with Republicans, to find common ground, not get everything that he wants but to get everything that would be good for the American public.\xc2\xa0 But yet again, the only reason it\xe2\x80\x99s not moving forward is because House Republicans are refusing to allow it to move forward.</p>\n<p>Wendell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said a couple of times that it would be okay if House Republicans decided that they had some sort of principled objection to this compromise and wanted to vote no.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s not okay is for the House Republican leadership to continue to obstruct a piece of legislation that we know would pass the House of Representatives from even coming up for a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what immediate actions can President Putin take to get the U.S. and the EU to roll back their latest sanctions?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling on President Putin to take for quite a few months now.\xc2\xa0 The first step is he could use his influence with the Russian-backed separatists.\xc2\xa0 After all, as Mr. Blinken, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor, mentioned here earlier this week, many of the leaders of that separatist movement are actually Russian citizens.\xc2\xa0 So presumably, their President would have some influence over them.\xc2\xa0 Getting them to agree to lay down their arms and agree to a cease-fire with the Ukrainian government would be an important first step and something important for President Putin to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing that President Putin could do would be to prevent the transfer of heavy weapons from the Russian border -- from the Russian side across the border with Ukraine and put them into the hands of Russian separatists.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Russian military, at the direction of President Putin, conduct training exercises to ensure that those Russian-backed separatists know how to use that heavy equipment to maximum effect.\xc2\xa0 There have been some tragic consequences for those decisions.\xc2\xa0 And those are just three examples of the kinds of things we would like to see President Putin do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Until he does them, he will face deepening isolation from the international community and the possibility that the international community would impose further economic costs on Russia for his failure to live up to basic international norms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President made these points specifically clear to President Putin, perhaps on the phone or through any diplomatic liaison?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 On multiple occasions at multiple levels, including at the presidential level, our insistence that President Putin and Russia live up to basic international norms has been made crystal clear.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few.\xc2\xa0 I just saw that Treasury added a few more people to the list of those being sanctioned in regard to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that?\xc2\xa0 It includes a Russian Railways individual.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that latest round of announcements, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at Treasury who may be able to give you some more information.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Israel -- to follow up on Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question, specifically with regard to the ammunition that Israel has asked for and the U.S. has said it would give the Israelis, is there any acknowledgement at the White House that sending the Israelis more ammunition might prolong the conflict?\xc2\xa0 And was there any consideration not to send it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the request that was made by the Israelis to the Department of Defense was part of a routine foreign military sales delivery.\xc2\xa0 The requested items were readily available and were provided as they have been on numerous other occasions.\xc2\xa0 For details about that specific transaction, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, can you just give voice to your reaction at the White House to the Boehner lawsuit broadly and what it portends for a defense on behalf of the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jessica, I think the response here at the White House is some disappointment that rather than focusing on raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing equal pay for equal work, lowering the costs of a college education or even fixing our broken immigration system, the Republicans instead are focused on a frivolous taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>The fact is that Republicans in the House have repeatedly rejected any attempt to try to get them to do their job, that there are some common-sense pieces of legislation that they could pass -- that would pass -- if they would allow them to come up for a vote.</p>\n<p>And that inaction has tarnished the standing of the House Republican leadership in the eyes of the American people, and it certainly has prevented the nation\xe2\x80\x99s elected representatives in Washington from living up to their commitment to try to make progress for the American people.</p>\n<p>And what the President has said is he is going to move forward, unbowed in the face of that obstruction, to try to make progress where he can within the confines of the law on behalf of middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you say, you\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed.\xc2\xa0 What does this White House view the basis for these lawsuits are, for why the lawsuit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- despite the legislative time and attention that\'s been devoted to this taxpayer-funded political stunt, it is actually not yet clear what the legal basis -- what their legal basis is for filing the lawsuit.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\'re -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports that they are planning to file a lawsuit related to some provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but their opposition to the Affordable Care Act is not new.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at their legal reasoning, assuming there is one, and determine what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to defend -- or represent the views of the administration in a court of law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they explained their legal reasoning.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen their -- they haven\xe2\x80\x99t put forward a proposal yet in terms of their lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They say you acted beyond your bounds, you\xe2\x80\x99ve acted illegally in these executive orders.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you, what do you think the real reason is for this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve described it as a taxpayer-funded political stunt before, and I think that is an appropriate label in this circumstance as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, there are concerns from some of the leaders, the black leaders in this country and those who advocate for Africa, many of the countries on the continent of Africa -- there are concerns that this summit will be overshadowed once again as Presidents have tried to focus in on Africa before, and there have been other issues, other major issues, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been overshadowed.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to these leaders as this President is convening the largest contingent of African leaders to come to talk about issues of investment, and it\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly to be win-win situation for both sides?\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I do think this demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s historic commitment to advancing American interests on the African continent; that there is ample opportunity for Africa nations and the United States of America to find areas of common ground where we can -- where both sides can make some progress.\xc2\xa0 And so having a robust discussion about what citizens in Africa can do to promote greater respect for human rights in their country is a worthy endeavor.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to facilitate some conversations between private sector leaders in Africa and private sector leaders in this country to opportunities to cooperate economically in ways that benefit the economies and businesses on both sides.</p>\n<p>There is an opportunity for us to build some deeper cultural and personal bonds between the African people and the American people.\xc2\xa0 So there are a variety of opportunities, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to devote some significant time -- two or three days -- to this effort.\xc2\xa0 And it builds upon the historic trip that the President made last year to Africa.\xc2\xa0 I know that you traveled on that trip, and I think were probably struck in the same way that the President was about the importance and the opportunity that exists for American involvement and for the opportunity to strengthen that relationship between the U.S. and those nations in Africa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try to attack this one last time.\xc2\xa0 As you are dealing with very serious issues in the Middle East, dealing with very serious issues with Russia and Ukraine, is there a place for serious issues to be on the forefront in the next couple of days when it comes to Africa?\xc2\xa0 Will they get as much attention?\xc2\xa0 That\'s what people want to know.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly going to get the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and the President will be devoting significant time and attention to this very important series of meetings.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the media attention that it leaves, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in your hands.</p>\n<p>Goyal, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, Secretaries of State and Commerce are in India, and they just released a joint statement.\xc2\xa0 And, one, if these Secretaries are carrying special messages from the President?\xc2\xa0 And what is the future of the U.S.-India relation under the new government in India?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Goyal, I know that when Secretary Kerry and Secretary Pritzker are traveling in India and meeting with their counterparts in India, they do so with the expression of full support from the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly recognizes the importance of a strong relationship between the United States and India.\xc2\xa0 That relationship is multifaceted.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an important national security relationship that exists there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are obviously very important economic ties between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 There exists the potential for us to build on some of those economic ties.\xc2\xa0 And I know that was the subject of some discussion during the talks earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is looking forward to being briefed by officials at the State Department and at the Commerce Department about the results of those conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, second, as far as the new sanctions against Russia are concerned, how these countries will affect, like, India doing business with Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the sanctions regime that has been put in place against Russia is one that has been carefully coordinated across the global community.\xc2\xa0 So there was a sanctions regime that was put in place by the United States that was followed by sanctions from our European partners.\xc2\xa0 I know that many of our G7 partners have also put in place some pretty tough economic sanctions against Russia, and that will limit Russia\xe2\x80\x99s access to the international financial community and it will deepen their isolation.\xc2\xa0 And that is specifically a result of steps that President Putin has taken to destabilize the area in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He has failed to accept and acknowledge and abide by generally accepted international norms.\xc2\xa0 There have been consequences for that.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that by putting in place these economic costs, it will cause him to reevaluate his strategy in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you telling countries like India not to do business or act -- or support the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what our sanctions regime entails.\xc2\xa0 And if you have questions about that, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:30 P.M.
