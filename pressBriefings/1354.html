GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, we\'re going to hear from our Administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate, to give you all an update on the flooding in Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as the storms that we all saw last evening in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 The last couple weeks we\'ve seen a lot of severe weather moving through the southeast Atlantic states and Gulf Coast areas, including now central parts of the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, as many of you know, we had a rather significant tornado outbreak across Tennessee going into Arkansas -- right now, reported five fatalities, numerous injuries.\xc2\xa0 And we have been in contact with the state team there since last night.</p>\n<p>We already had a presence in Oklahoma from previous disasters, so we\'re working with Albert Ashwood, the State Emergency Management director, and his team there requesting that we conduct joint damage assessments with state for both impact to survivors as well as government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They have no outstanding federal response needs, which is -- given the severity of the tornadoes, many people say, well, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t FEMA responding?\xc2\xa0 And the answer is because in many disasters, the local and state responders are dealing with the response phase and they\xe2\x80\x99re assessing whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need federal assistance for recovery.</p>\n<p>But earlier in the week we did see another severe weather outbreak, this time manifested in heavy rainfall across Tennessee, Kentucky, as well as Mississippi.\xc2\xa0 And that did result in significant flood damage, particularly in Tennessee, where the governor requested on Monday of last week an expedited major presidential disaster declaration -- which, on Tuesday, the President concurred with and declared that a disaster did exist in the state of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>Prior to that we actually had folks working with Tennessee, as we knew the severe weather was impacting the state with the flooding.\xc2\xa0 We have regional offices, 10 of them, and our office of Atlanta, the region which covers the state of Tennessee, deployed staff in Saturday evening and began working with the state.\xc2\xa0 But once again, much of the response was being done by local responders, state officials, volunteers and other groups.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, our role in this response was to support recovery, and that recovery I\'m afraid is going to be substantial.</p>\n<p>So far, just as of this morning, over 23,000 people in the state of Tennessee have registered for individual assistance.\xc2\xa0 Right now we have already approved in our system $51 million for individual assistance.\xc2\xa0 Much of this is going to individuals who have lost their homes and not had flood insurance or had uninsured losses.\xc2\xa0 And we expect these numbers to continue to increase as we do that outreach.\xc2\xa0 And again, through your ability to get the word out to folks, the process of beginning that assistance with FEMA is to register.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the state of Tennessee or watching that -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking a lot about this -- is you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to register at 1-800-621-FEMA to start this process.</p>\n<p>After Monday, I had actually met with the governor and brought his request back.\xc2\xa0 I went back Thursday and particularly wanted to get out to some of the more rural areas of the state, western Tennessee.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of focus on Nashville, so the tendency is -- the images you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is that Nashville got hit hard; what about the rest of the state?\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that what you saw in Nashville was being replicated across the state, moving all the way over into Shelby County in Memphis, little communities such as Millington, up where Russia Naval Air Station is, got heavily impacted.\xc2\xa0 Small towns throughout rural Tennessee, heavily damaged, flooded, businesses still under water.</p>\n<p>In fact, on Thursday when I was there, you still had water rising in parts of the river system there -- a lot of impacts, agricultural, but a lot of impacts to homes.\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, again, not many people have flood insurance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working to support that.</p>\n<p>But the great story out of Tennessee was the level of participation of volunteers -- faith-based organizations, local responders, the state, and our role as the federal government in support in the recovery phase.\xc2\xa0 Since that time, Secretary Napolitano was there Saturday, met with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s team to address issues.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had Secretary Locke.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had Secretary Donovan yesterday, SBA Administrator Mills there today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the things we know about these large-scale disasters is FEMA does not provide all of the tools necessary for a complete recovery.\xc2\xa0 In this case, with the duration and the types of disasters, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require a full federal response and a full federal recovery going far beyond our FEMA program.\xc2\xa0 So we already have been working at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction to start addressing not only the immediate needs of the survivors, but also beginning to look at long-term recovery for the state of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>This response, again, on top of tornadoes previously in the week in Mississippi and Alabama, today President Obama has declared the state of Kentucky now as part of the disaster from last weekend.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to respond in support of those survivors, those communities -- but through the state teams.</p>\n<p>The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and FEMA have actually put together a Facebook page to help update people with fast moving information, allowing people to share information.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you that information.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of one of these long-winded things.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like tndisasterinfo\xc2\xa0 -- \xe2\x80\x9ctn\xe2\x80\x9d -- for Tennessee -- disasterinfo.\xc2\xa0 But again, the idea of starting to use more and more the tools that are reflected for people. (The correct website that FEMA Administrator Fugate mentioned in the briefing is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TNDisasterInfo">http://www.facebook.com/TNDisasterInfo</a>)</p>\n<p><br/>\nAnd then the last piece before I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it back over for questions, is when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with these situations, a lot of our stuff we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done on the Web.\xc2\xa0 Well, if your home is flooded you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Internet -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t get to the Web; how do I get information?\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, about two weeks ago, we had been working on something to get out a mobile version of our website, so if you have your phone you can get information in a format for you.\xc2\xa0 So if you go to m.fema.gov with your phone, you can get information that\xe2\x80\x99s tailored for you, the survivor, to figure out very quickly the sources of information, get those links, and be able to get assistance without having to go through the full website.</p>\n<p>That just happened to be something that came online, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really, I find, very useful for people who are not at home, probably staying at a hotel, staying with friends, or staying somewhere else like a shelter, trying to get information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, m.fema.gov, 1-800-621-FEMA.\xc2\xa0 In all these states where we have individual assistance declared, the first step is to register.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the last part is, we cannot do this response without the communities themselves, the state, and the federal family.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like I tell people, FEMA is not a team; we\'re part of a team.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re there supporting the governors on behalf of the President and Secretary Napolitano in this initial response phase.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got time for a few questions because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the Administrator to the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 He and the President are going to talk to Governor Henry from Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we were in Tennessee on Saturday, we talked to Secretary Napolitano, and she said that the extent of FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to help was limited.\xc2\xa0 Given how many people there did not have flood insurance, how heavily impacted they are and how limited the FEMA aid is, where do you suggest these people go, beyond that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously $29,000 isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough if you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost your home and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have flood insurance.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 That is correct.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, part of the reason why -- we look at disasters a lot differently than probably in the past, and we know that it takes a full federal team to support recovery.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of programs that Secretary Donovan brings to the table, with the HUD Community Block Development Grant; other types of programs that help.\xc2\xa0 Plus another thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve not always done well on the federal side, and that is really collaborate with faith-based and volunteer organizations that can oftentimes provide labor and other assistance to people in trying to rebuild their homes, where we can use our dollars for materials.</p>\n<p>And so, again, if you come in and you do what I call a federal-centric or government-centric response to these disasters, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot of unmet needs, because we do have very defined programs and limits to those programs.</p>\n<p>But if you look at a team approach and looking at what are the resources in a community; where are we going to be able to pull resources together to address particularly those folks that just are not going to have many other options -- for a lot of folks, some of the more affluent neighborhoods, SBA disaster loans will help them get their homes repaired.\xc2\xa0 But for those that don\xe2\x80\x99t have the ability to do the loans and where our grants may not be able to return their home back to a useable condition, partnered with volunteers and other groups as part of a team effort gets us to those unmet needs.</p>\n<p>And so this is our approach of not just looking at what one program can do, but how do we leverage the entire federal family to recognize there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of other resources in the community that we have tended not to bring to bear or work in a coordinated fashion.\xc2\xa0 Oftentimes, they were trying to do one thing -- we\xe2\x80\x99re over here, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t help the survivors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who leads that?\xc2\xa0 Is it your team?\xc2\xa0 Or is the state?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a joint team.\xc2\xa0 We go into a coordinated response with the state.\xc2\xa0 I have a federal coordinating officer, as appointed by the President.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Gracia Szczech -- she\xe2\x80\x99s there, worked a lot of disasters before.\xc2\xa0 And we work with TEMA, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.\xc2\xa0 And then at each local level, you have various groups, but generally coordinated through the county or city emergency operations centers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So one of the groups that we were working with or talking to, that set up some of the first information center was All Hands, a volunteer organization that was already working, getting information to the survivors in the aftermath of the disaster.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s our ability to, one, work with the state as a team, and then bring in and work with some of the more traditional volunteer organizations like Red Cross and Salvation Army, but also some of their very localized -- or may only be in one community.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Tennessee delegation sent a letter to the President today asking for a separate appropriation in the supplemental.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to consider that yet.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with legislative affairs to see if the request has been received and what it might be.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have them check on that.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if either one of you can talk about the administration take on the Hill hearing today where BP and the other companies are sort of pointing fingers everywhere --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that when we get to -- if you guys have any more --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is FEMA going to have any role in the oil clean-up at this point?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 FEMA has already had a role.\xc2\xa0 You understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a separate statutory authority and a separate funding stream to respond to an oil spill where you have a responsible party.</p>\n<p>So a lot of people go, well, what\xe2\x80\x99s FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s role?\xc2\xa0 Our role as part of DHS, as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, is a support role to our lead agency within DHS, Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been supporting them with actual staff as far as public information and liaison roles, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t do a lot of flood -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t do a lot of oil spill stuff, so we are more of a support role.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged from the very beginning.\xc2\xa0 I was actually involved in one of the briefings with the President early on when the initial aftermath was still focused on search and rescue.\xc2\xa0 And so our job at FEMA I think is a little bit different than what you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen before in that how we responded to Haiti, how we responded to the oil spill, where FEMA is not the lead agency.\xc2\xa0 The President commits the full team; we all have support roles.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, our support role is, within DHS, is to the Coast Guard for some of their coordination staffing issues of some things that we can add to their response. <br/>\nBut in many cases, this would not be untypical of another federal agency having the lead where FEMA is still in a support role.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is FEMA financially able to handle all of these disasters right now?\xc2\xa0 Because we understand recently FEMA was running out of money and there was a call for more money from Congress to -- more money for FEMA.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the disaster recovery fund, which is an allocation that we\xe2\x80\x99re given based upon potential disasters, also dealing with previous disasters in the past.\xc2\xa0 Around the February time frame, we were running to a point where our fund balance was getting below what we were comfortable with, having to deal with existing disasters and future disasters, so we go into what we call immediate needs funding.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is we are still funding response, individual assistance, and immediate needs, but we have stopped all funding for permanent work going all the way back to disasters prior to Katrina.</p>\n<p>So we have limited our funds to just those things that are necessary to do a response, to meet initial needs, take care of individuals, the survivors of the disaster, but we have stopped all of our permanent work until we get a supplemental to support that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So for this immediate funding, with this immediate needs funding, I mean, how long does it take for this money to run out?\xc2\xa0 How much money do you need, or how much money do you have to deal with these emergencies?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really kind of an unknown.\xc2\xa0 Given where we are right now with Tennessee, we\xe2\x80\x99re still fine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still responding, but it is finite.\xc2\xa0 And so again, we are working.\xc2\xa0 The House has passed the supplemental request.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now with the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We have done things to really minimize our impacts and be able to continue to focus on response.\xc2\xa0 And we continue that as we await final resolution on replenishing the disaster recovery fund.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much is in the supplemental?</p>\n<p>ADMNISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 The request from OMB and us as we worked this up is $5.1 billion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Katrina.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about how much the lessons learned from Katrina are guiding you in Tennessee and what those lessons learned are.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 To me, the big lesson was -- I was actually the state director in Florida during that time frame; I was there through the hurricane and stuff -- was you got to go in as a team, you got to work as a team, and you got to focus on survivors.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ve been able to demonstrate, with the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, our commitment to that and his commitment to bring the full team to bear.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not one of these things where one agency is trying to solve all the problems by themselves.\xc2\xa0 We really bring together the expertise of all the agencies and look at what the needs are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When hurricane season starts in, what, two or three weeks, what --</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Twenty-one days.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what shape are you in when a first big storm hits?\xc2\xa0 Will you be able to handle it?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, the first big storm -- generally hurricane season may start June 1st, but really the time frame when you start seeing the more devastating hurricanes tends to be about August, mid-August through.\xc2\xa0 Again, we are resetting, because as much as people focus on hurricanes -- and I come from a hurricane-prone state -- Chile and Haiti should have taught us something.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t get to pick the next disaster.\xc2\xa0 And an earthquake could strike at any time.\xc2\xa0 Any other event that could occur, we have to be ready all the time.</p>\n<p>So although hurricane season gives us a reminder to get people ready for something, at FEMA we have to be ready 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t get the luxury of waiting for a forecast season; I have to be ready to go.\xc2\xa0 So we keep adjusting.\xc2\xa0 Even with Tennessee and others, we have a lot of disasters going; we keep resetting our team and looking at where we\'re at and go, right now if something happens, what are we ready to do and what do we have to do to be prepared?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The present situation right now, are you fearful that you might not be able to meet the need, as things arise with the financial problems that you\'re going through?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if I looked at it just as FEMA was the only game in town, I might be a little bit concerned.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not the only game in town.\xc2\xa0 We work as a team on the federal side, again, with a relationship that we have in this administration across all our resources.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to respond; we\'re going to take care of people.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the question.\xc2\xa0 The question is really getting back to the permanent work, and that right now we cannot move forward on without supplemental.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s like tag-team wrestling, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, your turn.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'m all for that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m all for that.</p>\n<p>Let me just give you guys a quick update on -- tomorrow Elena Kagan will make her way to Capitol Hill, as I think some of you know.\xc2\xa0 Let me give you the schedule of senators that she will see:\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid at 10:00 a.m.; Senator McConnell at 11:00 a.m.; Senator Leahy at noon; Senator Sessions at 12:45 p.m.; and Senator Durbin at 2:30 p.m.\xc2\xa0 And as we get updates to that, we will provide them to you.</p>\n<p>Ms. Loven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll resubmit my previous question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your take on the Hill -- the BP hearings on the Hill and all these companies pointing fingers in opposite directions\xc2\xa0 about the right way for them to go.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in the middle of their finger-pointing, except to say that we obviously have an active investigation per what the President tasked the Interior Secretary to find out as to -- to identify the case of what happened.</p>\n<p>The President -- I think you all got a readout from the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I would -- watching him in that meeting, I would say the President is deeply frustrated that we have not plugged this leak.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the focus of -- I would say that\xe2\x80\x99s what a majority of the meeting time was spent on.</p>\n<p>Secretary Chu is heading to the area to work with the response team to make sure that we have some of the best and brightest minds down there trying to think through next steps for doing so.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President is deeply frustrated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I switch to the climate bill coming out tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Has the administration -- does the administration support or is it pushing for a provision to let states have veto power over offshore drilling plans by other states?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that inside the legislation, but I can have somebody check and see if that\xe2\x80\x99s -- where that might lay.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one question on the European debt crisis, and then one follow-up on the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 First on Europe.\xc2\xa0 How -- as the White House has monitored the European reaction to this, how big of a risk is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there now to the U.S. economy and, in fact, indeed to the global economy as a whole?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think anytime -- let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our economic team and the President have been engaged over the course of many weeks in monitoring the situation that was going on with many of these countries, encouraging them to take the steps that are necessary to deal with it, because of a fear that anything might stem the recovery that we believe is taking place, and not wanting to see any of that happen.</p>\n<p>The President spoke this morning with Prime Minister Zapatero from Spain, who will seek reforms in his parliament, I believe, tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So it is something that the President and the team have been actively engaged on to ensure that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t unnecessarily impact either our recovery or that of the global economic recovery -- which has obviously been the topic of virtually every multilateral meeting that the President has traveled to and including the events in Pittsburgh last fall.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Spain is a country that many are concerned would be a much bigger crisis if it were to default.\xc2\xa0 Why did the President call Zapatero this morning and what did he say?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the personal aspects of the call except to say we continue to play a role in encouraging the Europeans, as I said a minute ago, to do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to ensure that this problem is dealt with and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why Spain?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re one of the countries that, as I said, that are -- because of some of their problems, need to undertake reforms that the Prime Minister is starting to work through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one question about the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 The Interior Department announced today some reforms.\xc2\xa0 Will there be more regulatory reforms and proposals coming through in response to this oil spill similar to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President was very clear with the team again yesterday -- he wants everything to be looked at. I do think it is tremendously important -- and the President believes this as well -- the steps that Secretary Salazar is beginning to undertake -- and understand that this is not going to require legislation, the Secretary can do this administratively -- to split off MMS into one that is concerned with leases and royalties and one that is concerned with management and safety, and to ensure that an agency with a purview like that never gets its two tasks mixed up.</p>\n<p>I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important going forward.\xc2\xa0 But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before and as the President has said, we will look at everything -- every bit of this process, to ensure what can be strengthened, what needs to be changed, what might have been the cause and how we can rectify that.\xc2\xa0 The President is very serious about ensuring that the notion of failsafe means that.\xc2\xa0 That has to mean something to him, given what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow on the EU rescue plan, has the President in his conversations with these European leaders gotten a sense of confidence that this rescue plan is enough to stabilize the situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too deeply into their personal conversations except to say I think the President and the team have believed, as I think many in Europe have, that steps needed to be taken.\xc2\xa0 And these are important steps in ensuring that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of confidence that this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we think the actions that were taken were necessary, needed, and we\xe2\x80\x99re glad they happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Karzai meeting with the President, you and other administration officials have talked about how he\xe2\x80\x99s the elected leader of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, very little is said about whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s real confidence in him.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this will -- if there will be strong language from the President tomorrow in saying, listen, I need you to do this, I need you to do more in order to build confidence?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take this a couple different ways, first a little bit more broadly.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused and always has been focused on substance.\xc2\xa0 We have a job to do with a partner in the government and the country of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is; that\xe2\x80\x99s what our team\xe2\x80\x99s focus is.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get bogged down in atmospherics or personalities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We already have.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re here to do.\xc2\xa0 Our focus will be on evaluating the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made since -- security-wise, since the President increased our forces there, and to go through what progress has been made on a governance side.</p>\n<p>We understand, and I think the government of Afghanistan understands the importance of the steps that it has to take both, again, on the security side in training a force -- a security force and a police and army -- as well as what it takes to hold an area and ultimately have that area transferred to the control of the Afghans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the process, right?\xc2\xa0 Clear and hold in conjunction with ISAF and Afghan forces; building and transferring that to the control of the Afghans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the process that they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk through tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that totally answers the question, though. I mean, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of the President, when he sits down with him, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about all the progress that has been made, but is he going to hold his feet to the fire?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw or read yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing; we went through a lot of this.\xc2\xa0 We have a relationship with the people and the country of Afghanistan where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have agreements and disagreements.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to laud them for the steps that they take, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with them to do what is necessary to deal with the problems of governance, accountability, and corruption.</p>\n<p>Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been -- the reason I started with the atmospherics and personalities is because I think people get focused on that and they don\xe2\x80\x99t see some of the progress that has been made, right?\xc2\xa0 You heard Ambassador Eikenberry talk about this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 There are high-level corruption trials that are going on right now.\xc2\xa0 The High Office of Oversight now operates with a mission to increase its accountability.\xc2\xa0 And we are watching, as we will always, the implementation of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ve asked for, and Karzai has signed, a law to improve sub-national governance.\xc2\xa0 Again, we will watch the implementation of that because, again, all of this is necessary as we undertake the security and the governance side of this.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve asked for, and President Karzai understands the need for, fair and transparent parliamentary elections that are upcoming.\xc2\xa0 And not long after the President visited with President Karzai in Kabul, there were some important appointments to the electoral complaints commission, which we think is an important step forward in dealing with a fair and transparent parliamentary election that\'s in the interest of the people of Afghanistan as well as in our interest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I get the White House is encouraged by some of the steps that President Karzai has taken, but on the Hill there seems to be still a great deal of skepticism.\xc2\xa0 Majority Leader Hoyer said this morning that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that President Karzai is up to the task of confronting corruption.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, does the White House share that skepticism?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'d refer you to the answer that I gave, which is we believe there are steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken and we believe there are more steps that they have to take.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the President of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for Osama bin Laden?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people that are working on that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on, again -- we\'re focused on the security and the governance with our partner in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s underwater video of the leak in progress that BP has that they have said that they would release to the press at some point.\xc2\xa0 So far they have not.\xc2\xa0 Has the President, and who in the administration has seen this video feed?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House think that the public should have access to this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Coast Guard has asked for BP to make that available to the press, so the answer to your second question is, yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the degree which -- who in the administration has seen it.\xc2\xa0 I believe that it is -- I believe that they have seen it at the Unified Command Centers in the area. I don\'t know who in the administration has seen it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the White House is in charge, if the federal government is in charge of all of this, couldn\'t they force BP\xe2\x80\x99s hand to make that video available?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve asked that to happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it happened?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask that of BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question:\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate a little bit more on Beau Biden?\xc2\xa0 We got this sort of cryptic email from the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office today.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything more?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more than what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been told by the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 And updates on that will come from them.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whose war is this in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 We keep running them and telling them what to do, so is it our war or is it their war? Or is it a civil war?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an international component to this, Helen, because the attacks that were planned when the Taliban had an area that allowed al Qaeda to plan what happened on September 11th -- obviously that occurred in the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By why don\'t you ever want to know what happened and why it happened?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have never had an explanation of why they want to attack us.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99re there attacking there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re there to ensure the safety and security of our people after the safety and security of our people were threatened by what happened on 9/11.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re there, Helen.\xc2\xa0 And the international community is there because there have been attacks all over the world as --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We never try to find out why.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we have -- I think we have seen and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about people have distorted one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great religions into believing that terrorism and violence is the answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Muslims?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about some who have corrupted that great religion, yes -- certainly not everybody, and not everybody by a long shot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we go in to kill and maim and send drones.\xc2\xa0 Is that Christianity?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are things that have to be done -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on specific tactics.\xc2\xa0 There are things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Afghanistan through, again, an international security force, to ensure that al Qaeda does not have a safe haven with which to plan attacks on our country, or countries around the world.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few things.\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to Prime Minister Brown today or yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did not yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- just as I was coming out, he made a statement -- as there are developments of Britain forming a new government, we will reach out to -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s David Cameron, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will have an opportunity soon to speak with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have not heard from anybody in the last 24 hours?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The decision -- you said the President has asked Energy Secretary Chu to go down there, I guess -- is he leading a task force to try to come up with new ways to plug the hole?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Secretary Chu is down there based on some improvements that he suggested on ways to look at what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there -- I mean, was there any orders before yesterday to, hey, can we work on -- can we have X agency working on figuring out alternative plans to plug the hole?\xc2\xa0 Or was it all relied on BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Chuck, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing everything that we can.\xc2\xa0 Some people have criticized, well, the military didn\xe2\x80\x99t send a C-130 down until -- I said this, I think at one point on the back of the plane, there\xe2\x80\x99s not somewhere on a dock in Annapolis a secret submarine that will fix this leak.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that to be funny.\xc2\xa0 I mean that it is -- the President has asked that everything in our power be done.\xc2\xa0 Everything in our power is being done.\xc2\xa0 The frustration that the President has is that, despite all of that, and despite the efforts of others, there still continues to be a very large oil leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean do you feel like at this point BP is as forthcoming as they can be and doing everything that they can do at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If we have problems with what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, we have communicated and will continue to communicate to them things that have to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary Salazar has been there -- been down there so often to ensure that everything that can be done is being done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any additions to the schedule before next Tuesday for Senator Specter?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It appears that Solicitor General Kagan did an interview yesterday right after the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve now posted that on the White House website.\xc2\xa0 Who did the interview?\xc2\xa0 And can I have one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s on the website, if you want to see it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know who did the interview?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think it was Arun who does the video stuff, similar to what we did with Judge Sotomayor during the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a White House staffer interviewing her?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would she like to do another one with a journalists?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 She has -- she\xe2\x80\x99s not told me that, no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell her we\xe2\x80\x99re deeply frustrated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will.\xc2\xa0 I will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is the President frustrated with?\xc2\xa0 Is he frustrated with BP in this oil situation?\xc2\xa0 Is it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s frustrated with the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a leak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not minimize.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xc2\xa0 Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s frustrated with the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re still sitting in a place --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not frustrated with BP\xe2\x80\x99s efforts so far --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or its ability to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, let me be clear -- because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to put words in my mouth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m answering.\xc2\xa0 The President is frustrated with everything, the President is frustrated with everybody, in the sense that we still have an oil leak.\xc2\xa0 That includes us.\xc2\xa0 That includes anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s involved in this.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to see this leak plugged.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that meeting yesterday, was the President told that, yes, sir, there is a way to plug it?\xc2\xa0 Or is that still a possibility, it might not be able to be plugged?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there were a series of things that I think BP has talked about that members of the group went through:\xc2\xa0 a small containment dome to take into account the hydrates that had formed 5,000 feet under the ocean with the larger containment dome.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on progress that is being made in terms of drilling a relief well which, candidly, will take quite some time, and -- as well as getting updates on our progress on dealing with, again, the oil that has come up, how it\xe2\x80\x99s being dealt with both at a subsea and at a surface level, and the impact both environmentally and economically, largely what the President has been focused on the whole time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the readout you put out yesterday, you said the President called for independent experts to be brought in and help --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today is the 15th day of this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, they\xe2\x80\x99re -- BP I know has consulted with\xc2\xa0 -- I was in a meeting the first week of this where John Holdren, in our Office of Science and Technology, has consulted with people in and out of government, as has Secretary Chu and others.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President still believes it can be plugged?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Believes that, and the President wants us to do everything in our power to ensure that that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, to follow on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the Senate has approved an audit of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s emergency lending that it exercised.\xc2\xa0 The President will be supporting -- or signing that bill I assume.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fast-forward the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s process.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of financial reform that you heard Deputy Secretary Wolin say that the administration supported last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any concern at the White House here that back provision would alter the traditional independence of the Fed at some point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because again, this was -- our original concern was that the broader amendment as written by Senator Sanders would unnecessarily politicize monetary policy.\xc2\xa0 That was our concern with it.\xc2\xa0 He rewrote that amendment to ensure that it was directed at the transparency as to what had happened as a result of the financial collapse and the money that had to be spent.\xc2\xa0 And we were supportive of that transparency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sort of narrowing the language then --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we supported the amendment that passed, the Sanders Amendment that was re-written.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest in revising Miranda come from a specific case that he feels did not go as well as he might have liked?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why does he feel the current system is not as good as it could be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me share that -- look, I think that what has happened in this case, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard officials discuss that the public safety exception was used to originally question Shahzad.\xc2\xa0 There was -- intelligence officials the Attorney General consulted, the power was given to those in the room, experienced interrogators, to decide when the best time would be to do that.\xc2\xa0 They did that.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Shahzad continues to speak with those that are questioning him about those events.</p>\n<p>Our only thing is to look at, as we have in each and every case, any ability to provide necessary flexibility for those in law enforcement to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to get what is needed.\xc2\xa0 But I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what the law says.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this would be -- Helen, I think we discussed this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The President is a believer in this law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- despite a lot of armchair quarterbacking from people with not a lot of experience in interrogation have brought this up.\xc2\xa0 But the President is committed to it and ensuring that we have protections, as well as flexibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I noticed the Daily Caller today reported that Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod have drivers -- government drivers to and from work and been accorded Secret Service protection.\xc2\xa0 And I wondered if that is correct.\xc2\xa0 And also are any other top aides to the President -- Rahm or yourself or others -- afforded that status?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Afforded what status?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service protection and also the driver.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, each President is afforded six opportunities to provide transportation.\xc2\xa0 The President does that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Six for the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into who has protection and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 That is a decision that is made by the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 I will mention that the number of non-statutory protectees -- obviously there are people that have protection based on the law.\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service makes evaluations as to those who might need it.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into who, where, and why.\xc2\xa0 But those currently -- currently in our administration there are 33 percent fewer non-statutory protectees than at the end of the previous administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you just explain, does the protectee status come with a car --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or is that a separate decision that the President makes to provide transportation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make protectee decisions.\xc2\xa0 Protectee decisions are made at -- by the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 If you have questions about that, I would speak with the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but he makes the decisions about the transport?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is up to six that can do that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and has up to six that he can do that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say why he chose Valerie and David as two of the six?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Based on their jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You get one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is on the documents from General Kagan\xe2\x80\x99s White House service -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just following up on what you guys were saying about this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is it your anticipation that all of those documents will be made available?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my anticipation that the committee and individual senators will seek documents from her work via the Clinton Library, and we look forward to working with them to fulfill reasonable requests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it your belief that the executive privilege will cover any of those documents?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check more deeply with counsel on that.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just briefly on what Secretary Chu is being asked to do.\xc2\xa0 Is he going down there to propose additional steps, or to try and get BP to take steps that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Salazar has been down there to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with the pacing of their response. He\xe2\x80\x99s been down there I think a number of times.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s traveling back down there with Secretary Chu in order to -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve got various different response teams that Secretary Salazar thought he might be helpful with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you just -- just add one thing to that.\xc2\xa0 Will the White House get involved in the decision about which documents would be made available by the Clinton Library, or do you think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with counsel on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, it\xe2\x80\x99s May 11th, and it\xe2\x80\x99s 20 days away before the Black Farmers deadline comes up May 31st -- $1.25 billion, and you have Cobell, $1.4 billion; and then you have FEMA for what FEMA had just said, $5.1 billion.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 Realistically, what do you think is going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into prognosticating except to say you know those are priorities of the President.\xc2\xa0 I think -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, as Administrator Fugate said, on the disaster relief fund, that supplemental appropriation has passed.\xc2\xa0 The House of Representatives -- I think they tried to get unanimous consent today in the Senate and that was objected to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what about the Black Farmers?\xc2\xa0 They are pushing for this money -- it\xe2\x80\x99s 15 years.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement on that and we continue to work to make that happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Boyd wants a meeting with the President.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to get that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that request.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President considering a trip to Pennsylvania to help Specter, who looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I just want to be clear that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking about it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Fannie Mae said it needed another $8.4 billion in aid.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern?\xc2\xa0 And how long is that going to go on for if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to need that much --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they -- I think that was in line with what we had expected in terms of their losses.\xc2\xa0 We are strongly supportive of the need to reform the GSEs.\xc2\xa0 As you heard again last week, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the answer that Deputy Secretary Wolin gave in terms of Secretary Geithner having started a process for this.\xc2\xa0 We are eager to see reform but understanding that reform has to take into account a very fragile housing market.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to working with Congress in the future on that.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that should be a cause for any delay in the reform that the Senate is considering now, that the President and I believe many believe is necessary in putting important rules of the road going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related to the Gulf oil spill, do we know whether MMS approved displacing the mud in the pipe before Halliburton finished the cementing plug -- plugging with cement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to MMS.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In all the President\xe2\x80\x99s briefings on the BP oil spill, has it come up that this might go on for weeks or months?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is anyone in the government considering what to do in that case, how to deal with a oil leak that goes for such a long period of time?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, I think I referred to it earlier as -- look, the estimates for drilling a relief well are many weeks.\xc2\xa0 Yes -- we talked about that yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who is involved then in talking about contingency plans on the government end on how you do it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Everybody that\xe2\x80\x99s involved right now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, the -- let me see if I can remember sort of going around the table yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw these names on a readout, but there were -- John Brennan was there; Secretary Napolitano was there; Secretary Salazar; Secretary Chu; John Holdren, who I mentioned earlier -- who was sitting in front of me? -- Carol Browner was there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what are some of the ideas --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dr. Lubchenco was there from NOAA -- hold on -- EPA; the Secretary of Defense Bob Gates; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen; General Jones; Rahm Emanuel.\xc2\xa0 This was a pretty senior-level meeting at the White House in the Situation Room with the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what are some of the ideas under consideration for dealing with a leak that goes on for months?\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s speculative.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, a lot of that obviously happens as a result of -- well, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s modeling that has to take place and NOAA is working through some of that.\xc2\xa0 EPA is monitoring the air as it relates to aspects of controlled burns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried.\xc2\xa0 Monitoring obviously is going on as it relates to, as I said a minute ago, sub-sea and surface dispersants -- even as SBA is in the area working through a claims process for the economic damage.</p>\n<p>So, David, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s not involved right now that would be called in to deal with long term, as they\xe2\x80\x99re already here.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two questions.\xc2\xa0 One was, going back to the Miranda rights issue, a lot of lawyers actually have spoken up that the reading of the Attorney General about the public safety exception is a bit loose in that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking much more time than was generally believed to be allotted for a public safety exception. Will the administration look --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, walk me through --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The legal reasoning behind that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, for starters -- I mean, I could get very detailed, but essentially it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be a very limited time period in which you can exercise the public safety exception.\xc2\xa0 For instance, if someone burglarizes a store, it\xe2\x80\x99s to look for his gun.\xc2\xa0 And this was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what set up the Quarles exception for public safety, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question is the same -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what the interpretation is -- will the administration look for a legislative vehicle to expand upon what would --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 The President is interested in limited flexibility.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the law that we have in place is an important one, and obviously any change that would take place would have to be done legislatively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the second question is, the White House sent out the op-ed in the Wall Street Journal from the former Harvard Law dean about military recruitment on campus.\xc2\xa0 But earlier today Vice President Biden said that Solicitor General Kagan was right to oppose military recruiters.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can explain --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just -- again, I think -- we sent out the op-ed because I think you have seen those that have said the military did not have access to the campus at Harvard Law School -- okay?\xc2\xa0 The op-ed that we sent out -- for anybody who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to send it to you -- is from the former dean, the dean that preceded Elena Kagan who instituted the policy of non-discrimination that Elena Kagan continued.</p>\n<p>Again, we sent this out so that -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s people that either don\xe2\x80\x99t know or are unwilling to understand the facts. The military had, through a student organization, access to Harvard Law School students.\xc2\xa0 And the semester in which they did not have access to the Office of Career Services actually saw an increase in the number of Harvard Law School students that joined the military.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, 68 senators, Republicans and Democrats, have sent a letter to the President asking him to support ratification of the international treaty banning landmines.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the update.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get something on that.\xc2\xa0 I know there was some discussion of that recently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the United States hasn\xe2\x80\x99t used them since 1991, so why the hesitation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My hesitation is I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the United States traded and had diplomatic relations with China and with the Soviet Union, but with Iran we insist they jump through all kinds of hoops and meet certain conditions.\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we just establish --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What do you mean?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clear, I think.\xc2\xa0 We say they have to come to the table and talk -- why can\xe2\x80\x99t we just establish normal ties with Iran like we had with China and the Soviet Union, and traded with them?\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we do that with Iran?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m misunderstanding your question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve offered -- on any number of occasions we\xe2\x80\x99ve offered to allow them the opportunity to live up to their international obligations and to enjoy what comes from being part of the full international community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, why can\xe2\x80\x99t we just unilaterally recognize the Iranian -- why can\xe2\x80\x99t we do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m misunderstanding your question.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve given them I think plenty of opportunity with which to join the international community, but being part of the international community means living up to the obligations and the treaties that you sign that are part of the international community.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t be part of the international community and then not live up to your responsibilities as it relates to nuclear activities.</p>\n<p>I think you saw the President discuss last fall in Pittsburgh a fairly specific instance in which they were required to live up to their responsibilities internationally and they failed to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Guantanamo, real quickly, it\xe2\x80\x99s been four months, I think, since the one-year deadline has passed.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard too much about Gitmo lately.\xc2\xa0 Bring us up to date, if you could, on its --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new.\xc2\xa0 Obviously last week I believe -- I may have -- well, I think at least two detainees were transferred to European countries.\xc2\xa0 I forget off the top of my head where those are.\xc2\xa0 We continue to go through and ensure that we have -- go through the files and make sure that we have a proper accounting of those that are there; understand and make transfers of those that we believe are able to be transferred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rendition, you mean?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 This is -- these are people that can be transferred, again, to someplace like -- I think it was Spain and Bulgaria, but I\xe2\x80\x99m relying on a weeks-old memory on that.\xc2\xa0 So -- but we continue to work for a long-term solution that would close that facility.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:24 P.M.
