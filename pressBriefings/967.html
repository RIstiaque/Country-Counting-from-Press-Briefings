Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:15 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I will make a quick announcement at the top, which is that I have a parent-teacher conference that I am committed to making, and so I need to keep this at about 35 minutes, if I could.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hah.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen my kids\xe2\x80\x99 report cards?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all good.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen, can I take your questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I have a couple questions on the U.S.-Israel-Iran front, based on the interview the President did with The Atlantic.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to reconcile a couple of points about the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\xc2\xa0 He says in the interview, and he\xe2\x80\x99s said before, I believe, that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to tell Israel how to handle its own security.\xc2\xa0 But then he also talks about how an Israeli attack on Iran could be a distraction that would allow Iran to portray itself as a victim.\xc2\xa0 So I mean, in a sense, for reasons he thinks are very legitimate, isn\xe2\x80\x99t, in fact, he is trying to tell Israel what to do, which is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not to attack and let sanctions work.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we share in our constant and regular communications with Israeli government, military and intelligence officials, are judgments of the diplomatic situation, the situation regarding Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of nuclear weapons technology, and ideas about what contingencies might breed what outcomes.\xc2\xa0 But that is quite different from trying to tell a sovereign nation how to make a decision.\xc2\xa0 And the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to do that, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t presume to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When asked if he plans to ramp up his rhetoric with the Prime Minister about the red line issue, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got options including the military option,\xe2\x80\x9d and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t bluff.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel like, privately and publicly, it has, in fact, already spelled out its red line?\xc2\xa0 It has gotten specific?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously gave this interview and spoke extensively about this issue.\xc2\xa0 He, the Secretary of State, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, military leaders, intelligence leaders are in regular consultations with our Israeli counterparts.\xc2\xa0 One of the hallmarks of the American-Israeli relationship under this President is the level of cooperation and consultation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he is not -- does not need to communicate through an interview with Israeli leaders because he communicates with them regularly.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think he has probably met with Prime Minister Netanyahu more than any other leader.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, that\'s one thing.\xc2\xa0 And then I think, yes, the conversations that he and the Prime Minister have, that leaders of this administration and leaders of the Israeli government have, are full of detail and analysis.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think there will be -- I think the Israelis understand the policy approach that this President has taken and what our view is of what Iranian behavior is about, what our view is of the time and space that still is there for us to continue to pursue the diplomatic path -- isolating Iran, pressuring Iran to change its behavior.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we share a lot of information in the intelligence sphere about what exactly Iran is up to with regards to its nuclear programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, the President describes his relationship with the Prime Minster as "functional," and I\'m wondering, given the closeness of this relationship, or how it is portrayed to us, is "functional" good enough?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was in the interview and I think it was a -- he was giving the antonym of the question, which was, some have described it as dysfunctional and he countered, it\'s actually the opposite, it\'s functional.\xc2\xa0 It is a full relationship.\xc2\xa0 It is a candid relationship.\xc2\xa0 They meet and speak regularly.\xc2\xa0 Obviously even very close friends, as America is to Israel, don\'t agree government-to-government on every single issue -- matters of tactics versus strategy.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s a productive, candid, functional relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as the President elaborated on that comment about the relationship and said it was a very functional relationship, and talked about the areas in which they agree, he also described it as more of a business-like relationship than a personal rapport.\xc2\xa0 He said they both have had a lot on their plates, and talk more about business than personal issues.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that it\'s important to have more of a personal rapport with the Prime Minister, and is that going to be one of the goals for the meeting on Monday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President feels that the issue that folks are focused on right now in relation to the American-Israeli relationship is one of paramount importance in terms of not just Israel\'s national security, but U.S. national security\xc2\xa0 -- and regional and global security -- and that what is most important is that we have the kind of communication and cooperation with our Israeli counterparts that we do have, and that it is clear to Iran and clear to the world what our approach is and what our view is -- our approach is towards Iranian behavior and our view about what Iran needs to do and what its options are.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the President said in that interview and he said other times, when he took office the world was divided about what to do over Iran\'s nuclear ambitions and Iran was unified.\xc2\xa0 The reverse is now true because of the approach the President took, and leading the international community by demonstrating his willingness to negotiate -- discuss with Iran, to sit down and talk with Iran if it were willing to demonstrate its commitment to upholding its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 By taking that approach, he has helped unify the international community in an unprecedented level of unanimity in its approach to Iran, which has resulted in an unprecedented level of international action against Iran as a result of its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, the relationship is sound.\xc2\xa0 I think the President also pointed out that what is true about the relationship is that Israelis know that our friendship with Israel and our support for Israel and our commitment to Israeli security is a bipartisan fact of our life here.\xc2\xa0 And Americans understand that that relationship is the same regardless of which party is in power in Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is -- the President looks at this as not a political issue, although some here would politicize it, but as an issue of a strategic, vital partnership with Israel, and a matter of national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about the details of the meeting?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a lunch?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a joint press conference?\xc2\xa0 Is it just --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything beyond the fact that they\'re meeting to talk to you about today.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama called the Georgetown University law student, Sandra Fluke, within the hour.\xc2\xa0 Why did he call her and what did he tell her?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was actually more recent than that; it was probably about 20 minutes ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s within the hour.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, you\'re right, it was within the hour.\xc2\xa0 I just know that that is what I was -- I was in the Oval when he did, and that\'s one of the things that delayed the briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President called Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke -- I think is actually how you pronounce it -- because he wanted to offer his support to her.\xc2\xa0 He wanted to express his disappointment that she has been the subject of inappropriate, personal attacks, and to thank her for exercising her rights as a citizen to speak out on an issue of public policy.\xc2\xa0 And it was a very good conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that all you can tell us about the conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think so.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t -- it was several minutes.\xc2\xa0 They had a very good conversation.\xc2\xa0 I think he, like a lot of people, feels that the kinds of personal attacks that she\'s -- that have been directed her way are inappropriate. The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways is bad enough.\xc2\xa0 It is worse when it\'s directed at private citizen who was simply expressing her views on a matter of public policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it appropriate for Democratic organizations to try to raise money off of this attack on her?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that I\'ll leave that to whatever organizations might agree with her or sympathize with her.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the President was expressing his support for her, and his disappointment in the kind of attacks that have been leveled at her to her, and his appreciation for her willingness to stand tall and express her opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on the same subject, although not on Ms. Fluke.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, at Iowa State University, was referring to the conscience debate about contraception, and he said that, \xe2\x80\x9cIt got screwed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\'s a quote from the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 Why did it get screwed up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you remember when the President came out and made his announcement about -- from this podium about what the approach he was going to take and direct his administration to take with regards to religious institutions like colleges, universities and hospitals, the idea from the beginning, which we attempted to make clear, was that there was going to be a yearlong period where we would work to achieve a resolution to this that would preserve religious liberty and still provide the contraceptive services to women no matter where they were.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat was clear, as the President I think was pretty explicit about when he was here, is that for whatever reason, the debate was such that it became imperative in his mind that we come up with that resolution in a far quicker period of time.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we did, because he felt it very important that people understand that he took the religious liberty issue very seriously, as he expressed here from the podium.\xc2\xa0 His own experience with faith-based organizations when he was a young man demonstrated to him the importance that they have in our public life, and he believed very clearly that we could extend this important health care coverage to all women, no matter where they work, and do it in a way that still found that balance that preserved religious liberty.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Jay, the last time -- the few times the President has met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, much of the focus was on the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0 Is the focus on Iran pushing that aside, overshadowing that effort at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that Iranian behavior is a front-and-center issue right now for this President in terms of national security policy, and certainly in his discussions with the Israeli Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 But it is not the only topic that they will discuss, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the only topic of importance between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 The President remains committed to doing everything his administration can to encourage both parties, both sides, to come to the table negotiate a two-state solution that both sides have said they want and which really is the only way to achieve long-term peace in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that remains an important item on the agenda, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be discussed when the two leaders meet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have discussed here today quite extensively the nature of the relationship between the two leaders, but is there trust in that relationship?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there is.\xc2\xa0 There is, I think, a very clear understanding of because of the level of cooperation at the highest levels, as well as at the variety of levels that I discussed of what we see with regards to the Iranian issue, what we see is happening there, what our policy is and how and why we\xe2\x80\x99re pursing it, why we think, as the President has said, a diplomatic solution where Iran renounces nuclear weapons ambitions is the best option in terms of resolving this problem for the long term, as opposed to temporarily, and that -- because there is time and space available to continue to pursue that path, to continue to pressure Iran, to isolate it, to have the ever-increasing level of sanctions bite in terms of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economy, that that is the right way to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the case, as the President made clear in that interview that he does not take any option off the table, and that everybody should be clear about that, that he does not bluff.\xc2\xa0 When he says that no option is off the table in our potential response to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of a nuclear weapon, he means it.\xc2\xa0 And I think he made that clear in the interview.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t bluff,\xe2\x80\x9d does he mean referring to Iran acquiring the capability, or acquiring a weapon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have made clear that we are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We are -- there is a staged process here.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why as I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, and others have, we know there is time and space to continue to pursue a diplomatic path with sanctions and diplomatic pressure is because we have visibility into Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program -- we have IAEA inspectors on the ground -- and we know that they have not made that breakout move towards acquiring nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to pressure Iran.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work with our allies to ratchet up sanctions, to isolate the regime.\xc2\xa0 And the price that they\xe2\x80\x99re paying for their behavior is already high and it will get higher.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the policy we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then a follow on the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with Georgetown law student, Sandra Fluke.\xc2\xa0 Was the President made aware of Rush Limbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s comments?\xc2\xa0 Is that why he placed the call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly is aware of them, yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what did he think of those comments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- this is not a quote from him, but I think he thinks they were reprehensible, they were disappointing, they were -- it is disappointing that that kind of -- those kinds of personal and crude attacks could be leveled against someone like this young law school student who was simply expressing her opinion on a matter of public policy, and doing so with a great deal of poise.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President frustrated that Republicans have been able to convince at least other Republicans that he\xe2\x80\x99s too tough on Israel and too soft on Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Wendell, as you know, there is for some folks an overlay of American domestic politics here.\xc2\xa0 As I know from being with him when he discusses these matters, this is a matter not of domestic politics for him, but a matter of American national security and the security of our close ally, Israel.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach he takes.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd these are extremely serious issues.\xc2\xa0 And, as, again, I think he made clear in the interview that he gave to The Atlantic, he is fully focused on the threat that Iran represents both to Israel, to the region, to the United States, and to the world.\xc2\xa0 And his policy has been designed from day one to prevent Iran from achieving or acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reports out of Israel indicate that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants the President to spell out the red lines Iran will not be allowed to cross without the U.S. joining in military action.\xc2\xa0 Is that likely to happen this weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President addressed that very clearly in his interview yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think he made very clear that when we talk about the options available to the United States, and made clear, as he does, that we rule out no option, that we take no option off the table, that includes obviously the military option.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, it is our policy that the best opportunity we and our many allies on this issue have of resolving the threat posed by the potential of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is by doing it diplomatically -- by pressuring Iran into changing its behavior so that it makes the decision, that Iran makes the decision, its leaders make the decision, to forsake pursuit of this, of a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we have time and space to continue to pursue that policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President also made clear that there is -- it is not strategically in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to draw explicit red lines as to what hypothetical action by Iran would result in a specific reaction by the United States.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made clear what our policy is.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear that we do not rule out any option in responding or in dealing with Iranian behavior.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is the way it will remain going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I give you -- oh, sorry, one more on a purely political question.\xc2\xa0 The President recently crossed the hundred fundraiser threshold in the 2012 campaign, which is being used to beat up on him for focusing more on his reelection than on the affairs of state.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at a result of Citizens United here.\xc2\xa0 At this point, George W. Bush had done roughly half as many fundraisers as the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know specifically what it\'s a result of, as you say.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the President has -- is engaging in political events because that is what is required to run for President and run to be reelected as President.\xc2\xa0 It is also true that, as I understand it -- and I would refer you to the campaign for more details -- that there is an enormous amount of support for the President and a desire to participate in these political events in support of his campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is that it is still -- and I hesitate to give a percentage -- but it is still a fairly small portion of his time.\xc2\xa0 And he is still enjoying, if you will, the fact that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a primary opponent.\xc2\xa0 The other party is engaged in a primary campaign, the length of which is yet to be determined.\xc2\xa0 He understands, having experienced it himself, that they can go on for some time.\xc2\xa0 He is able, because he does not have an opponent and won\xe2\x80\x99t have one until the other party has picked its nominee, to spend relatively less time than he might otherwise have had to have spent if he had a primary.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is no question that as we get closer to the fall, the President will, as every incumbent President has who is seeking reelection, be spending more time campaigning for reelection.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t conclude that he appears to be starting earlier to cover the impact of super PACs?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he started earlier necessarily.\xc2\xa0 He just may be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The numbers suggest --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He just may be more successful at it than some of his predecessors.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Minutes after speaking with the President, Ms. Fluke -- I believe is the correct pronunciation of her name -- appeared on the Andrea Mitchell show, and she talked about the message from the leader of Georgetown University -- I believe the title is the president of Georgetown University -- was largely conciliatory, supportive, and talked about the need for more civil discourse in society.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that the President feels that Rush Limbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s comments were reprehensible, disappointing and crude, what if anything should be done --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear.\xc2\xa0 You guys were asking me a question.\xc2\xa0 I will say the President expressed to Sandra Fluke -- I think is the pronunciation -- that he was disappointed that she was the subject of these crude -- of these personal attacks.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that \xe2\x80\x9creprehensible\xe2\x80\x9d was my word.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- but look, these were unfortunate attacks that were leveled against her, and the President feels that way.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unfortunate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They were inappropriate and reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 But the point is, the President called her to thank her for speaking out on a matter -- and doing so with great poise -- on a public policy matter, and to express his disappointment that she had been subjected to these kinds of attacks.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- my understanding is that\xe2\x80\x99s not quite the complete quotation from the President of Georgetown, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to you to check into that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a follow-up, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Andrei, you\xe2\x80\x99re next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just two.\xc2\xa0 Last night at one of the fundraisers in New York City, the President made a comment that instead of running campaign ads, I can just run footage of these GOP debates and people will be able to see clearly the differences.\xc2\xa0 And his tone was one of ridicule, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say.\xc2\xa0 But repeatedly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard White House officials and I think even the President himself say that you expect a very tough and close race in the fall.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that the President apparently doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have high regard for the way the GOP candidates are conducting themselves, is it still the case that you still expect a tough, close race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would take issue with your characterization of what he said.\xc2\xa0 I think the point, as he and I and others and folks at campaign have made, is that what we have seen from the competition on the other side to produce a nominee for the Republican Party is that no matter who the nominee is, assuming it\xe2\x80\x99s somebody from the current field, the policies are very much the same.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the policies are essentially reiterations of -- often on steroids -- of the policies that got us into this mess\xc2\xa0 -- that say we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to regulate Wall Street, even though the financial crisis was the worst since the Great Depression and the fact that Wall Street was operating on its own set of rules contributed greatly to that.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to regulate or prevent insurance companies from throwing people off when they get sick -- throwing people off of their insurance coverage when they get sick, and we can throw off the many hundreds of thousands, I think a couple million even, younger Americans who have now -- who now have insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And we should -- again, according to the policy proposals put forward, which are quite similar to the ones that our Republican friends on the Hill have put forward -- we should not just -- not only should we not take a balanced approach to deficit and debt reduction, but in dealing with deficits and debt, we should go ahead and give bigger tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires while making life even harder for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the President believes that in a choice between those substantive policy positions on the economy and the ones that he has pursued and is presenting, that he believes that his options are better and that the American people will agree with him come November.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do Andrei and then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do one more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 In the run-up to the elections in Russia, President Putin published a number of articles, made a number of announcements, including on international relations.\xc2\xa0 He repeatedly was asked about Iran and Syria.\xc2\xa0 He basically -- his basic point is he is not happy with a certain trigger happiness in the world that exists.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A certain what?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Trigger happiness.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that -- are those your words or his?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my words, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of what he was saying.\xc2\xa0 He said that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- that guided the Russian position; in certain instances, it guided the Chinese position.\xc2\xa0 My question to you about that is you said we want to make our views known so that everybody -- there\'s no mistake about it -- knows. Do these views from Russia and China, do these views count for the White House?\xc2\xa0 And I also have a technical question about the election after.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, okay let me -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to move quickly.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the views of Russian leaders count.\xc2\xa0 We have a very important relationship with Russia and we will continue to have that important relationship.\xc2\xa0 We have been in regular consultation with Russian government officials on this very issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, Andrei, as you know, we profoundly disagree with the decision by Russia to veto the United Nations Security Council resolution that would have\xc2\xa0 -- that supported the Arab League proposal for a transition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And as regards to trigger happiness, I think anyone who has watched a single minute of footage of the brutal assault by the Assad regime on his own people understands that the trigger happiness is all on one side.\xc2\xa0 And the brutality being carried out in the city of Homs in the last 24 to 48 hours is disgraceful and horrific, and should be condemned by every nation of the world.\xc2\xa0 And we call on every nation of the world to join with the "Friends of Syria" to take action to prevent further brutality and further murder of Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\'t we have to move away both the government troops and the opposition armed troops?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And have you seen any sign, Andrei -- any sign -- of the government troops being willing to do anything but slaughter Syrian people who are peacefully demonstrating for more democracy?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, my --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Andrei, I got to go to the parent-teacher conference.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reelections, Jay, please.\xc2\xa0 Does the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Speaking Russian)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President follow the elections and does he know who is in the running?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his opinion?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess, despite my personal interest and history with Russia, that I have not discussed with him lately, but I know he is fully aware of the upcoming elections and the participants therein.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for having to end early.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get that to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have a nice weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:49 P.M.
