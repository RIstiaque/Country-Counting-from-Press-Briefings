EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to make one point before we get started.\xc2\xa0 I have with me today John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 And he will take questions from you about the events of last night and yesterday afternoon and what preceded those events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then if you have any questions on other subjects I\'ll do about 10 minutes after Mr. Brennan is finished to take those questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make a point before John comes up that as many of you know, the President, even before he was President, when he was a candidate, had a very clear idea about the approach he would take as President towards Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 In August of 2007, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won\'t act, we will.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In July of 2008, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must make it clear that if Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our sights.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he repeated statements like that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I just want to be clear that this is an approach that he always felt that he would take when he was President and then, as John will elaborate, once he took office he made sure that we would revitalize our focus on Osama bin Laden and the hunt for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, with that, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to invite John up to take your questions.\xc2\xa0 And I will be standing here, if you have questions on other topics.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the specific goal of the raid.\xc2\xa0 Was there a consideration to try to take bin Laden alive, or was the mission to kill him on sight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely it was to prepare for all contingencies.\xc2\xa0 If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that.\xc2\xa0 We had discussed that extensively in a number of meetings in the White House and with the President.\xc2\xa0 The concern was that bin Laden would oppose any type of capture operation.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, he did.\xc2\xa0 It was a firefight. He, therefore, was killed in that firefight and that\xe2\x80\x99s when the remains were removed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we certainly were planning for the possibility, which we thought was going to be remote, given that he would likely resist arrest, but that we would be able to capture him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you went into the operation believing that the most likely outcome was that he would be killed on sight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We were trying to make sure that we were able to accomplish the mission safely and securely for the people who were involved.\xc2\xa0 We were not going to put our people at risk.\xc2\xa0 The President put a premium on making sure that our personnel were protected and we were not going to give bin Laden or any of his cohorts the opportunity to carry out lethal fire on our forces.\xc2\xa0 He was engaged and he was killed in the process.\xc2\xa0 But if we had the opportunity to take him alive, we would have done that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask, have you been able to determine how bin Laden was able to hide in this relatively prominent location, and do you believe the Pakistanis when they say that they had no idea that he was there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight.\xc2\xa0 Clearly this was something that was considered as a possibility.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan is a large country.\xc2\xa0 We are looking right now at how he was able to hold out there for so long, and whether or not there was any type of support system within Pakistan that allowed him to stay there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that the people at the compound there were working on his behalf, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we ultimately found our way to that compound.\xc2\xa0 But we are right now less than 24 hours after this operation, so we are talking with the Pakistanis on a regular basis now, and we\'re going to pursue all leads to find out exactly what type of support system and benefactors that bin Laden might have had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily take them at their word that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing all leads in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on that, is it really credible that Pakistani authorities had no idea that this compound was being built and that it existed -- such an elaborate compound?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s inconceivable that bin Laden did not have a support system in the country that allowed him to remain there for an extended period of time.\xc2\xa0 I am not going to speculate about what type of support he might have had on an official basis inside of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We are closely talking to the Pakistanis right now, and again, we are leaving open opportunities to continue to pursue whatever leads might be out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also one of the things that a lot of people think about when they hear this news is what does this mean for the war in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 Does it make it easier to wind things down there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think the accomplishment that very brave personnel from the United States government were able to realize yesterday is a defining moment in the war against al Qaeda, the war on terrorism, by decapitating the head of the snake known as al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 It is going to have, I think, very important reverberations throughout the area, on the al Qaeda network in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been after for 15 years, goes back before 9/11.\xc2\xa0 So I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now is going to try to take advantage of this opportunity that we have to demonstrate to the Pakistani people, to the people in the area that al Qaeda is something in the past.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to bury the rest of al Qaeda along with bin Laden.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Situation Room yesterday, could you describe how you were monitoring the goings-on?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been described as a very tense -- understandably, a very tense scene.\xc2\xa0 Were you watching the operation?\xc2\xa0 Were you -- were you listening to it?\xc2\xa0 How were you getting your information?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The principals convened yesterday around midday.\xc2\xa0 There were others who -- we were here early yesterday morning.\xc2\xa0 The President joined us then early afternoon before the operation got underway.\xc2\xa0 When the operation did get underway, then the President rejoined the group, and we were able to monitor in a real-time basis the progress of the operation from its commencement to its time on target to the extraction of the remains and to then the egress off of the target.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was probably one of the most anxiety-filled periods of time, I think, in the lives of the people who were assembled here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The minutes passed like days.\xc2\xa0 And the President was very concerned about the security of our personnel.\xc2\xa0 That was what was on his mind throughout.\xc2\xa0 And we wanted to make sure that we were able to get through this and accomplish the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it was clearly very tense, a lot of people holding their breath.\xc2\xa0 And there was a fair degree of silence as it progressed, as we would get the updates.\xc2\xa0 And when we finally were informed that those individuals who were able to go in that compound and found the individual that they believe was bin Laden, there was a tremendous sigh of relief that what we believed and who we believed was in that compound actually was in that compound and was found.\xc2\xa0 And the President was relieved once we had our people and those remains off target.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it -- was there a visual, or was it just radio reports or phone reports you were getting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We were able to monitor the situation in real time and were able to have regular updates and to ensure that we had real-time visibility into the progress of the operation.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to go into details about what type of visuals we had or what type of feeds that were there, but it was -- it gave us the ability to actually track it on an ongoing basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand that there was a moment of real tension, one with the helicopter, but then also when the Navy SEALs were leaving and the Pakistani government started scrambling their jets, and there was a concern that they were coming to where the U.S. troops were, where the Navy SEALs were. Was there an actual concern that the Pakistanis -- since they were not apparently informed about this military operation, was there an actual concern that they might actually take military action against the Navy SEALs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t contact the Pakistanis until after all of our people, all of our aircraft were out of Pakistani airspace.\xc2\xa0 At the time, the Pakistanis were reacting to an incident that they knew was taking place in Abbottabad.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, they were scrambling some of their assets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clearly, we were concerned that if the Pakistanis decided to scramble jets or whatever else, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who were on those jets.\xc2\xa0 They had no idea about who might have been on there, whether it be U.S. or somebody else.\xc2\xa0 So we were watching and making sure that our people and our aircraft were able to get out of Pakistani airspace.\xc2\xa0 And thankfully, there was no engagement with Pakistani forces.\xc2\xa0 This operation was designed to minimize the prospects, the chances of engagement with Pakistani forces.\xc2\xa0 It was done very well, and thankfully no Pakistani forces were engaged and there was no other individuals who were killed aside from those on the compound.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about what documentation you may have found there?\xc2\xa0 Was it a bank vault worth of information, and are you able to potentially get some additional leads out of the information that was found?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The people who were on the compound took advantage of their time there to make sure that we were able to acquire whatever material we thought was appropriate and what was needed.\xc2\xa0 And we are in the process right now of looking at whatever might have been picked up.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into details of what might have been acquired.\xc2\xa0 We feel as though this is a very important time to continue to prosecute this effort against al Qaeda, take advantage of the success of yesterday and to continue to work to break the back of al Qaeda.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was it a lot of information?\xc2\xa0 How would you describe it in terms of the volume?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are trying to determine exactly the worth of whatever information we might have been able to pick up.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily quantity; frequently it\xe2\x80\x99s quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that you have Osama bin Laden, can you tell us how close the U.S. has gotten to him in the past, beyond Tora Bora?\xc2\xa0 Any other close calls that we have not been informed about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Over the years -- Tora Bora was certainly the last time that we had actionable and we thought was very credible information about where he was located.\xc2\xa0 A number of leads have been pursued over the years.\xc2\xa0 I think what this operation demonstrates is that there are some very, very good people who have been following bin Laden for many, many years.\xc2\xa0 They have been very persistent.\xc2\xa0 They have pulled on every thread.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of that diligence and their analytic capabilities, they were able to track this and continue to build a body of evidence that suggested, circumstantially, that bin Laden was at that compound.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they did.\xc2\xa0 It was much greater confidence that we had in this body of intelligence, in this body of information, than we\xe2\x80\x99ve had since Tora Bora.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Still, though, there was nothing that confirmed that bin Laden was at that compound, and therefore, when President Obama was faced with the opportunity to act upon this, the President had to evaluate the strength of that information and then made, what I believe was one of the most gustiest calls of any President in recent memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the lead-up to that final mission, can you talk to us about how -- the anxiety of not being able to track, or even get the name initially of the gentleman who led you to the compound?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 In counterterrorism work and doing what\xe2\x80\x99s called targeting analysis, it is exceptionally tedious and painstaking as far as taking a little bit of data and piecing it together and trying to correlate it with something else.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of the information that we had in a very generic way about these couriers and individuals who were cohorts with bin Laden, over time we were able to piece together additional information, get the name he was known by, his nom de guerre, associate that then eventually with his real name, associate that then with other things that that real name was associated with, and track it until we got to the compound in Abbottabad.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then over the past six months, with trying to ensure that we had the best visibility in terms of understanding what was happening at the compound, that body of evidence accumulating to the point when the President said, I want to have operations against this compound, I want to know what the pros and cons are of them, I want to have options, and I want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken into account the safety and security of the American people -- or of the Americans that would be conducting this operation, that we look at it from the standpoint of limiting collateral damage, and making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to maximize the chances of mission success.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And ultimately we got to that point; we could bring those together.\xc2\xa0 The President made the decision.\xc2\xa0 And the results I think speak for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that Osama bin Laden was actually involved in the firefight, and we had -- it has been reported that he reached for a weapon.\xc2\xa0 Did he get his hand on a gun and did he fire himself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 He was engaged in a firefight with those that entered the area of the house he was in.\xc2\xa0 And whether or not he got off any rounds, I quite frankly don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thinking about that from a visual perspective, here is bin Laden, who has been calling for these attacks, living in this million dollar-plus compound, living in an area that is far removed from the front, hiding behind women who were put in front of him as a shield.\xc2\xa0 I think it really just speaks to just how false his narrative has been over the years.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, looking at what bin Laden was doing hiding there while he\xe2\x80\x99s putting other people out there to carry out attacks again just speaks to I think the nature of the individual he was.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In these anxiety-filled minutes that you said lasted like days, what was the most anxiety-filled moment?\xc2\xa0 Was it when the helicopter appeared to be inoperable, or was it when you heard shots fired?\xc2\xa0 And when you monitored in real time, could you actually hear the shots fired?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 You know, when you plan these things out, you have already -- you know in your mind exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s the first step, second step, and everything going along.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s any deviation from that, it causes anxiety.\xc2\xa0 But the individuals who carried out this assault planned for all the various contingencies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when that helicopter was seen to be unable to move, all of a sudden you had to go into Plan B.\xc2\xa0 And they did it flawlessly.\xc2\xa0 They were able to conduct the operation as they were preparing to do.\xc2\xa0 But seeing that helicopter in a place and in a condition that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be, I think that was one -- at least for me, and I know for the other people in the room -- was the concern we had that now we\xe2\x80\x99re having to go to the contingency plan.\xc2\xa0 And thankfully, they were as able to carry out that contingency plan as they were the initial plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you hear shots fired?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We were able to monitor the situation in real-time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he actually -- can you describe any reaction by the President specifically when it became clear that this was Osama bin Laden and that he had been killed?\xc2\xa0 Do you remember the President\xe2\x80\x99s words or a reaction from --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, you say \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it became clear,\xe2\x80\x9d and that\'s one of the things that we had to do throughout the course of this operation.\xc2\xa0 When we heard that the individuals who carried out this assault felt as though they had an individual who appeared to be bin Laden, that is one data point.\xc2\xa0 Then there were other types of things:\xc2\xa0 facial recognition, height, the preliminary DNA analysis, so there was an incremental buildup.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the confidence was building.\xc2\xa0 But yet at what point do you feel confident that you have the person you\xe2\x80\x99re after?\xc2\xa0 So it was more of a growing sense of confidence and a growing sense of accomplishment.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one \xe2\x80\x9cah-hah,\xe2\x80\x9d when people say, okay, the DNA results came in.\xc2\xa0 No, this is something that was building over time, and we made a decision then last night, because we felt as though we were confident enough to go out to the American people and out to the world to say, we got him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction at any time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We got him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, circle back to a point you just made.\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden used women as human shields when American personnel went in?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There was family at that compound, and there was a female who was in fact in the line of fire that reportedly was used as a shield to shield bin Laden from the incoming fire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering where you are at this point on the idea of releasing photos of bin Laden to show the world that he is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are less than 24 hours from the arrival on target of those individuals.\xc2\xa0 We have released a tremendous amount of information to date.\xc2\xa0 We are going to continue to look at the information that we have and make sure that we are able to share what we can, because we want to make sure that not only the American people but the world understand exactly what happened, and the confidence that we have that it was conducted in accordance with the mission design.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we don\'t want to do anything that\'s going to compromise our ability to be as successful the next time we get one of these guys and take them off the battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there some thought, though, that releasing a photo or two might avoid conspiracy theories throughout the Muslim world?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are going to do everything we can to make sure that nobody has any basis to try to deny that we got Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And so, therefore, the releasing of information, and whether that includes photographs, this is something to be determined.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John, is the debate about whether to release something, or what to release, when it comes to visual evidence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s both.\xc2\xa0 I think, first of all, what falls into the category of things that you can potentially release to the public, whether it be those DNA results, whether it be comments about the conduct of the operation, what happened, the intelligence case.\xc2\xa0 And then you have to take a look at it from the standpoint of what are the upsides and downsides.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes when you conduct an operation that is based on intelligence and is based on the very sensitive and very capable forces that we have available to us in the U.S. government, you want to make sure that you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything to expose something that will limit your ability to use those same intelligence sources and capabilities in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who has -- has anybody secured this compound?\xc2\xa0 Has the Pakistani government now gone in, or the Pakistani army gone in to secure this compound since we --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I was just looking at al Jazeera a little while ago, I saw that I think the ISI or the Pakistani military police have that compound now under control.\xc2\xa0 And clearly it is the site of a major incident yesterday, and so, therefore, it would be my presumption that the Pakistani authorities would be in control of that compound.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who owned the land?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Whether it be the land or the compound, but it was two of the individuals who were killed -- the al Qaeda facilitators, as they\xe2\x80\x99re called -- the individual who was identified as the gatekeeper courier, the residence was, at least in my understanding, in his name.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that -- you called it just now that the President made one of the gutsiest decisions that he made.\xc2\xa0 That implies that there was some disagreement around the table about whether this was not -- this was not a unanimous recommendation --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this is the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 -- way he goes.\xc2\xa0 He goes around the room and he wants to hear people\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 And so you have a circumstantial intelligence case.\xc2\xa0 And so people will see that either there is insufficient circumstantial evidence to go forward with something like this, which involves a unilateral operation in another country to go after somebody you believe is Osama bin Laden -- and there were differences of views that were discussed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President wanted to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As well as a different -- what\xe2\x80\x99s called COAs, courses of action, which are the types of things that you can do that involve an assault on a compound, as well as from a standoff position -- what are the benefits of doing that from a remote location, like we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past in certain areas, as well as what are the risks associated with security forces actually going into the compound.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this was debated across the board and the President wanted to make sure at the end that he had the views of all the principals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it a close call, in your opinion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 For the President to go forward with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I have been following bin Laden for 15 years, been after this guy, and I have the utmost confidence in the people, particularly at CIA, who have been tracking him.\xc2\xa0 They were confident and their confidence was growing:\xc2\xa0 This is different.\xc2\xa0 This intelligence case is different.\xc2\xa0 What we see in this compound is different than anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was confident that we had the basis to take action.\xc2\xa0 I also, though, had the confidence that the U.S. team that went in there has exceptional skill to do this very capably.\xc2\xa0 So I was a supporter and I know a number of other people were supportive to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President had to look at all the different scenarios, all the different contingencies that are out there -- what would have been the downsides if, in fact, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bin Laden?\xc2\xa0 What would have happened if a helicopter went down?\xc2\xa0 So he decided that this is so important to the security of the American people that he was going to go forward with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us more about the role that the U.S. -- more of the role of how the U.S. is interacting with Pakistan and are we actively investigating what they knew and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about Osama bin Laden being there or not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, the President mentioned yesterday that he spoke to President Zardari, and a number of senior U.S. officials are in regular contact now with their Pakistani counterparts.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to engage with them -- we\xe2\x80\x99re engaging with them today -- as we learn more about the compound and whatever type of support system bin Laden had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would point out that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences of view with the Pakistani government on counterterrorism cooperation, on areas of cooperation, and what we think they should and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that Pakistan has been responsible for capturing and killing more terrorists inside of Pakistan than any country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s by a wide margin.\xc2\xa0 And there have been many, many brave Pakistani soldiers, security officials, as well as citizens, who have given their lives because of the terrorism scourge in that country.\xc2\xa0 So although there are some differences of view with Pakistan, we believe that that partnership is critically important to breaking the back of al Qaeda and eventually prevailing over al Qaeda as well as associated terrorist groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John, can you tell us about the burial at sea?\xc2\xa0 Where did it happen?\xc2\xa0 When did it happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The disposal of -- the burial of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s remains was done in strict conformance with Islamist precepts and practices.\xc2\xa0 It was prepared in accordance with the Islamic requirements.\xc2\xa0 We early on made provisions for that type of burial, and we wanted to make sure that it was going to be done, again, in strict conformance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was taken care of in the appropriate way.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into details about sort of the where, but that burial has taken place.\xc2\xa0 It took place earlier today our time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that decision made?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that decision made that he would be buried at sea if killed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it thought through years ago?\xc2\xa0 Was this part of the plan all along?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The COAs -- the course of action and the subsequent decisions that would have to be made have been developed over the course of the last several months.\xc2\xa0 Senior officials, and there was a working group that was working this on a regular basis, if not a daily basis, over the last several weeks, looking at every decision and based on what type of scenario would unfold, what actions and decisions would be made. It was looked at from the standpoint of if we captured him, what will we do with him?\xc2\xa0 Where would he go?\xc2\xa0 If he was killed, what will we do with him, and where would he go?\xc2\xa0 And it was determined that it was in the best interests of all involved that this burial take place, again, according to Islamic requirements, at sea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why at sea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us why that was a good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 It was determined that that -- there is the requirement in Islamic law that an individual be buried within 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 Went inside of Pakistan, carried out the operation, he was killed, he was removed from Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 There were certain steps that had to be taken because of the nature of the operation, and we wanted to make sure we were able to do that in the time period allotted for it.\xc2\xa0 Going to another country, making those arrangements, requirements, would have exceeded that time period, in our view.\xc2\xa0 And so, therefore, we thought that the best way to ensure that his body was given an appropriate Islamic burial was to take those actions that would allow us to do that burial at sea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John, did you consult a Muslim expert on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We consulted the appropriate specialists and experts, and there was unanimity that this would be the best way to handle that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if detainees at Gitmo have been informed of what has happened to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I do not know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that he was wrapped in a weighted white sheet.\xc2\xa0 How secure is that?\xc2\xa0 Are you confident the body is not going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Burials at sea take place on a regular basis. The U.S. military has the ability to ensure that that burial is done in a manner that is, again, consistent with Islamic law, as well as consistent with what the requirements are for a burial at sea.\xc2\xa0 And so that burial was done appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so today lawmakers are urging -- possibly reconsidering or reevaluating aid to Pakistan, maybe attaching strings to military aid there.\xc2\xa0 Was the White House --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think people are raising a number of questions, and understandably so.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in just the first day after the operation, and he was found in Abbottabad outside of Islamabad.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a number of people have questions about whether or not there was some type of support that was provided by the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 So I think people are raising these questions and how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a visual recording of this burial?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get other people a chance here.\xc2\xa0 Mara.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question about the burial and then something else.\xc2\xa0 Was there an imam there?\xc2\xa0 Was there a religious --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 It was done appropriately with the appropriate people there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And a question -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is for you or for Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to speak to the bipartisan leadership tonight at this dinner.\xc2\xa0 What is he going to say about this that\xe2\x80\x99s different than what he said before and that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly geared to them?\xc2\xa0 Can you just give us a preview?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have another 20 hours of information that has been acquired since what he said to the nation last night.\xc2\xa0 I think what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to do is to give the congressional visitors here an update on that.\xc2\xa0 Last night, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have some of the analysis that was done.\xc2\xa0 Now, we can say with 99.9 percent confidence that this was bin Laden. So it\xe2\x80\x99s those types of things, as well as to explain to the Congress, in many respects, some of the unique features of this mission, which were the extreme compartmentation of it; how it was kept so closely held within our government; why it was done in a unilateral fashion -- and so things along those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting that the burial -- that the U.S. offered the body to the Saudis for a burial, but they declined.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We, after we had confidence that it was bin Laden and that he was dead, we took the steps that we had agreed to in the interagency that were necessary to ensure that that burial entity was the most appropriate thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And so we touched base with the right people.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into any details about who we might have consulted with in the aftermath of his death and before his burial.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, can you give us any details on whether there were previous operations that were held off at the last minute because of fears and risks, or perhaps the inability to identify bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s body positively had it been done differently?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 You mean against this target?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Against this target.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 As I said, there were different courses of action about the options that were available to the President as far as whether there was going to be an assault on the ground or whether there was going to be some type of standoff option.\xc2\xa0 Discussed all the pros and cons of them, and through that process of discussion, the options were narrowed down until the President decided that this was the best option because it gave us the ability to minimize collateral damage, ensure that we knew who it was that was on that compound, as opposed to taking some time of strike there, and also as a way to do what we could to respect the sovereignty of Pakistan and also to allow us to engage with them immediately after the fact, as opposed to some type of ordinance that might be dropping on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one follow?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that questions are going to be raised about Pakistan, understandably, and the role of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 For you and your counterterrorism job, given now the history of the Raymond Davis episode and the fact that this was done without consultation, are you concerned that in just in your line of work it will be very difficult to reestablish a good working relationship with the ISI or the intelligence authorities there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s dialogue going on with our counterterrorism counterparts in the aftermath of this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re expressing understanding about the reasons why we did this.\xc2\xa0 They are appreciative that it was done without having Pakistani casualties outside of that compound.\xc2\xa0 The U.S.-Pakistani relationship, which is a strategic relationship, goes on a number of different areas and levels; counterterrorism is one of them. It can be a complicated matter.\xc2\xa0 As I say, we don\xe2\x80\x99t always agree on some of the things that we want to do.\xc2\xa0 But through that continued dialogue and communication, I think we get where we need to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is one more incident that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with, and we look forward to continue to work with our Pakistani colleagues, because they are as much, if not more, on the front lines of the battle against terrorism.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How certain are you that there will be some kind of movement to avenge this death, some kind of retaliation?\xc2\xa0 Is there -- if you still had the color-coded alerts, would this be a time when you would raise that alert?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Homeland Secretary, had announced that there was a change in the color-code system to the National Threat Advisory System.\xc2\xa0 And I think she has put out a statement saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the specific and credible threat reporting that would require some type, in their mind, of an elevation of that threat status.\xc2\xa0 Like any incident like this, what we do is take the prudent steps afterward to make sure that we have our vigilance up, that we are taking the appropriate measures so that our security posture is strong, both overseas and here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think there is always the potential for terrorist groups to try to strike out and avenge an operation like this, but also I think some of them are asking themselves, bin Laden is dead; the al Qaeda narrative is becoming increasingly bankrupt; there is a new wave sweeping through the Middle East right now that puts a premium on individual rights and freedom and dignity; and so al Qaeda, bin Laden -- old news.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time to move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that this is going to send a message to those individuals who are out there that terrorism and militancy is not the wave of the future, it\xe2\x80\x99s the wave of the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is al Qaeda weaker and never able to return to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 This is a strategic blow to al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 It is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient blow to lead to its demise.\xc2\xa0 But we are determined to destroy it.\xc2\xa0 I think we have a lot better opportunity now that al Qaeda -- that bin Laden is out of there to destroy that organization, create fractures within it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The number two, Zawahiri is not charismatic.\xc2\xa0 He has not been -- was not involved in the fight earlier on in Afghanistan, so -- and I think he has a lot of detractors within the organization.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'re going to see them start eating themselves from within more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, thank you.\xc2\xa0 There are reports that there was a replica of the compound.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about where and how that was put together?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 You can imagine that for something as important as this, and something as risky as this, every effort would be made to do the practice runs, understand the complexities and the layout of the compound.\xc2\xa0 There were multiple opportunities to do that in terms of going through the exercises to prepare for it, so that once they hit the compound they had already simulated that a number of times.\xc2\xa0 So this was done -- and again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into details about where or when. But needless to say, when they hit that compound, they had already trained against it numerous times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask you, as a follow-up, if you -- the compound was so big.\xc2\xa0 How did the SEALs know where to find bin Laden?\xc2\xa0 And was it -- can you say anything about was it a bedroom or a dining area or an open area or something like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The outer features of the compound were studied intensively and there were certain assessments made about where individuals were living and where bin Laden and his family were.\xc2\xa0 And they operated according to that.\xc2\xa0 And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when they got there exactly what some of the internal features of it would be, but they had planned, based on certain, again, observable features of the compound, how to carry it out.\xc2\xa0 And whoever it was that actually did the assault on that -- you named a certain group --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the bin Laden family part of the compound?\xc2\xa0 It sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Carrie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This might be a question more for Jay, but given the sort of unity that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from messaging from both sides, both parties in the last 24 hours, is the President going to make any appeal to leaders tonight that this sense of unity can carry through to the other issues that they need to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll address that because that goes to Mara\xe2\x80\x99s question, but I want to give John just a few more because he\xe2\x80\x99s got other things he needs to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go to April -- maybe two or three more for -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there any civilian -- I mean, how many civilian casualties were there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden died; the two al Qaeda facilitators -- the brothers, who were -- the courier and his brother in the compound; bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s son Hamza; and the woman, presumed to be his wife, who was shielding bin Laden.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he use her as a -- did he actually take her as a shield or did someone put her in front of him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there so I hesitate to say --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she was in front of him --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 -- but it was an effort to try to shield bin Laden from the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wife or his son\xe2\x80\x99s wife?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wife.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, I want to go back to a couple questions,\xc2\xa0 one on security.\xc2\xa0 The mindset of intelligence folks in this administration and the administration prior was that an attack -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not about if it would happen; when it will happen.\xc2\xa0 So are we now -- because you\xe2\x80\x99re saying this was a strategic blow, the head of the snake was lopped off, are we now changing that mindset, or has it changed because of this blow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the mindset that it\xe2\x80\x99s not if, it\xe2\x80\x99s when.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s basically saying something is going to happen there.\xc2\xa0 I think every day counterterrorism professionals, whether it be intelligence, military, Homeland Security, law enforcement, are trying to stop whatever attack might be out there, trying to uncover a plot that might be out there.\xc2\xa0 And so they go into each day believing that they can, in fact, have another day without a terrorist attack against U.S. interests either abroad or here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this does not mean that we are putting down our guard, as far as al Qaeda is concerned.\xc2\xa0 It may be a mortally wounded tiger that still has some life in it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous and we need to keep up the pressure.\xc2\xa0 We cannot relent, because there are individuals in that organization that are determined to try to carry out attacks and murder innocent men, women and children.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the death of bin Laden, what is the thought of this administration -- do you believe that the Pakistani government was transparent and being honest and forthcoming, given the information that they have now on Osama bin Laden -- what they knew, or going in to finding out more about this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people within the Pakistani government, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about who or if any of them had prior knowledge about bin Laden being in Abbottabad.\xc2\xa0 But certainly his location there outside of the capital raises questions.\xc2\xa0 We are talking to the Pakistanis about this.\xc2\xa0 But they, at least in our discussions with them, seem as surprised as we were initially that bin Laden was holding out in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You spoke earlier about using this as kind of a pivot point to demonstrate to the people of Pakistan that al Qaeda has passed, that there\'s a different future.\xc2\xa0 Is the President still firmly committed to visiting Pakistan this year to make that message in person?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a commitment that the President has made that he is intending to visit Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 A lot depends on availability, scheduling, whatever.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly that the people of Pakistan need to be able to realize their potential to have a life that is full of security as well as prosperity.\xc2\xa0 And because of the al Qaeda menace as well as other militant organizations in that country, too many Pakistanis have suffered and have died because of that.\xc2\xa0 And what the President is wanting to do and what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with the Pakistani government is to see what we can do to help the Pakistani government provide that type of lifestyle for their populace in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s do Stephen and then Sam.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let John go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the fact that bin Laden was found in such apparently comfortable conditions in Pakistan, and there are obviously big threats to the U.S. interests in places like Yemen in terms of terrorism, undercut the strategic rationale for the need to still have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The basis for the ISAF presence in Afghanistan is to bring that country the security that it can have, and to not allow al Qaeda to ever again use Afghanistan as a launching point.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re in ongoing discussions with the Afghan government, obviously the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that that part of the world, which has given rise to a number of groups -- al Qaeda, others -- that they cannot use that area with impunity to carry out attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are as determined as we ever have been to bring the security that these countries and these people need and deserve because of what we can, in fact, help them with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, may I?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- I know that we didn\'t let any other countries know before the strikes, but in the time that\'s unfolded since, has the President had any contact with the leaders of NATO countries?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The President has had a number of conversations with foreign leaders about this issue.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into the individual discussions he\xe2\x80\x99s had, but clearly this is something of international significance, and that he has -- and will continue to have in the coming days those discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t say if he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to, say, Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I could, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that\'s a follow, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, in light of the size of this -- the\xc2\xa0 unique features and the size of this compound, is it likely that the neighbors had known anything about this, who lived there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 When you look at the features of this compound, these very high walls -- 12-, 16-, 18-foot walls, barbed wire on the top, this was a family, this was a compound that had very limited interaction, to the best of our knowledge and observation, with the surrounding houses.\xc2\xa0 But it clearly was different than any other house out there.\xc2\xa0 It had the appearance of sort of a fortress, so it does raise questions about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they help them -- basically?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there was -- we have had some indications that the family that was there tried to remain anonymous and tried not to have that interaction.\xc2\xa0 But again, it does raise questions about a compound of that size in this area not raising suspicions previously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake had a follow-on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I just want to clear something up because I think a few of us are confused.\xc2\xa0 The woman that was killed was bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wife?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 That\'s my understanding.\xc2\xa0 It was one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he was using her as a shield?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 She served as a shield.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is my understanding -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re still getting the reports of exactly what happened at particular moments -- that when -- she fought back; when there was the opportunity to get to bin Laden, she was positioned in a way that indicated that she was being used as a shield -- whether or not bin Laden or the son, or whatever, put her there, or she put herself there, but, yes, that\'s again, my understanding that she met her demise, and my understanding is that she was one of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many other people were in that compound?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a reason you said 99.9 percent certain it\xe2\x80\x99s been bin Laden?\xc2\xa0 Why not say 100?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s based on DNA.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, if I could just -- I just want to start by addressing a question that Carrie and Mara had, which is tonight the President will obviously, as John said, make some remarks related to the successful mission against Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the themes you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely hear him sound will echo what he said last night, which is that this is a good day -- or good days for America and for Americans.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we were able to accomplish this says a lot about our country and our perseverance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you can fairly say that the victims in this country on 9/11, the Americans who were victims, were not Republicans or Democrats -- they were Americans.\xc2\xa0 Those who launched the -- who have been working on this diligently for nine and a half years -- not Republicans or Democrats; they\xe2\x80\x99re Americans.\xc2\xa0 Those who carried out the mission yesterday, the same could be said about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that one theme you\xe2\x80\x99d likely hear from the President on tonight is about the capacity for Americans to come together and achieve very difficult goals when we work together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we get that live?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We can follow up with you on logistics.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re -- there\xe2\x80\x99s some logistical issues here. We will get it to you right afterwards if not live.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let me just do 10 minutes or so, so that we can all file and other things.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll move around.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the Associated Press and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 This is sort of in line with some of what we were talking about, but obviously if the President gave this order, final order, on Friday morning and then went on this long trip on Friday, had the correspondents dinner on Saturday, he was golfing Sunday, can you talk a little bit about his mood as he was trying to keep this poker face going through these other events, meanwhile knowing the actions that were going to be taken in Pakistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important to note is that -- is, as John mentioned, the compartmentalization here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there was obviously a success here at a different level, which was the ability to keep the mission secret.\xc2\xa0 And having spent a great deal of time with him on Friday, I can say that he was focused on the devastation in Tuscaloosa.\xc2\xa0 He was focused on and talked a lot about it in the wake of that visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the experience that I think was unique about that is you discover that when folks get an opportunity to meet the President, there are different ways that they do that, in town hall meetings, or rope lines, or things like that.\xc2\xa0 But there is something unique about even a President being able to meet individuals who have suffered such terrible things as those residents of Tuscaloosa did in their moment of despair that\'s very powerful.\xc2\xa0 And I think he felt that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he was focused on that, and then obviously Cape Canaveral and then on to the commencement address at Miami Dade College.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having said that, he was obviously taking calls and being updated regularly, and the same goes with Saturday and Sunday, which Sunday he spent a great deal of his day in the West Wing and in the Situation Room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 George.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the meeting tonight, other than bin Laden, what is his objective as far as budget and the debt limit and so on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, this is a continuation of his effort to bring leaders of Congress here in a social setting with spouses to improve communication in general.\xc2\xa0 And there is no agenda, there\'s no goal in terms of budget or any other issue, except to have that kind of conversation, which I think he finds to be a useful thing to do in terms of, in some ways, creating a better environment for the kind of work that the White House and the Congress need to do together.\xc2\xa0 So nothing beyond that, George.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Andre.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 Briefly, who is in charge of the compound now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was asked.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our understanding on the visuals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that the Pakistani authorities are in charge of the compound.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, more importantly, what was the legal basis for the operation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to what the President has said.\xc2\xa0 Since taking office and prior to it, that given the attack that Osama bin Laden launched the United States, the lives that he took not just on 9/11 but on other occasions, that he was a high-value target and a legitimate target, and that this President believed since long before he became President that given actionable intelligence to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he would move very quickly and surely to take that action.\xc2\xa0 And the opportunity presented itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this would have applied not only to Pakistan but to other countries if he was found somewhere else?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that there was a great deal of confidence, as has been discussed by experts for a long time now, that he was in that border region or in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the hypothetical really makes a lot of sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President picked a new Commerce Secretary, and when can we see that announcement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements for you, or timing of personnel announcements for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just do -- Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, almost lost in this news is the NATO strike against Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s compound on Saturday, where his son was killed and three of his grandchildren.\xc2\xa0 Is it -- does the White House believe that that mission was in keeping with carrying out the U.N. resolution?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think there have been ample -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been ample commentary about that from NATO.\xc2\xa0 So we do believe that, and obviously continue to focus on that mission as we do on other missions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a message there to Qaddafi in this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You could say that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:49 P.M.
