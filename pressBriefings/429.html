Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday.\xc2\xa0 Let me do two quick things at the top, Julie, and then we\'ll get to the questions.</p>\n<p>First, we are pleased that the VA\xe2\x80\x99s new Secretary, Bob McDonald, was confirmed unanimously by the Senate last week, and we all look forward to him bringing his expertise, pragmatism and integrity to the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>No veteran should have to wait to receive the benefits they have earned.\xc2\xa0 And in recent months, the VA has taken aggressive steps to address the systemic issues found in the VA\xe2\x80\x99s health care system.\xc2\xa0 I know the President and Secretary McDonald want to build on this progress.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President will travel to Fort Belvoir, Virginia on Thursday, where he will emphasize our commitment to our veterans, including the work that has been done and the work left to do, by signing HR 3230, the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.\xc2\xa0 This new legislation that passed Congress with strong bipartisan support will put in place reforms and needed additional resources to meet the high standard of service that our veterans have earned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ll have more logistical details in the next day or two about Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s event.</p>\n<p>And then I have one other thing I want to do here before we move on -- just to say that the President and his entire administration are pleased to welcome 51 leaders from across the African continent to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital for the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which officially starts today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The three-day summit constitutes the largest engagement by any U.S. President with Africa.\xc2\xa0 We see this as an historic opportunity to strengthen ties with our African partners and highlight America\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding commitment to investing in Africa\xe2\x80\x99s development and its people.\xc2\xa0 The summit theme, \xe2\x80\x9cInvesting in the Next Generation,\xe2\x80\x9d reflects the common ambition to leave our nations better for future generations by making concrete gains in peace and security, good governance, and economic development.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This gathering follows our Young African Leaders Summit last week.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s long been bipartisan support for U.S. engagement with Africa, and this summit will build on that record.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more from the President and members of his Cabinet as the summit events unfold over the course of this week.</p>\n<p>So, with that, Julie, do you want to kick us off with some questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The State Department put out a statement over the weekend on the latest Israeli attack on a U.N. facility, and it was about as tough as this administration gets publicly with the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you can give us a sense of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s and the President\xe2\x80\x99s, in particular, level of frustration with the Israelis and the amount of civilian casualties we\'re seeing.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, do you see the U.S. being involved in any future cease-fire negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, we do continue to believe that the violence in Gaza should end as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And we do continue our work with the Israelis and Palestinians and other parties in the region to try to bring both sides to the table to bring this violence to an end immediately.\xc2\xa0 And as we\'ve said many times, it is not in the interest of either side for this violence to continue.\xc2\xa0 The tragic loss of life that we\'ve seen on both sides of this conflict needs to come to an end.\xc2\xa0 That tragic loss of life includes the many innocent Palestinian civilians who have been killed.\xc2\xa0 It also includes the Israeli civilians who have been killed by Hamas rockets that have been aimed squarely at them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is a need for both sides to come together to come to the negotiating table to end the violence and have a discussion and try to resolve diplomatically some of the very firmly entrenched differences that exist and have precipitated this conflict.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you see a cease-fire as being a realistic short-term goal right now?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like the Israeli position now is to continue this offensive until they feel that they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached whatever their goal is there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, ultimately the parties themselves will have to decide --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the U.S. has obviously been involved in these efforts over the last couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure, and we continue to be.\xc2\xa0 And what we are pushing for is a cease-fire, because we believe it is not in the interests of parties on either side of this conflict for this violence to continue.\xc2\xa0 And we do continue our efforts to encourage both sides to bring all the current violence to an end immediately, and come to the negotiating table so we can try to resolve some of these longstanding differences.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we go back to the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s statement over the weekend?\xc2\xa0 As I said, it was as tough as this administration gets when publicly discussing Israel.\xc2\xa0 What went into that decision-making?\xc2\xa0 Did you feel like it was necessary to take that tougher line publicly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of reports of the shelling of U.N. facilities in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 I think that there have been seven or so reports of that taking place.\xc2\xa0 And we have, over the course of time, expressed our concerns about the necessity of the Israeli military to live up to their own standards when it comes to protecting the lives of innocent civilians, even Palestinian civilians who are caught in the middle of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 What that statement from the State Department made clear is that the suspicion that militants are operating nearby does not justify strikes that put at risk the lives of so many innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>Now, as you know, Julie, there have been reports of Hamas using innocent civilians as cover to protect their weapon stockpiles or even to protect Hamas fighters.\xc2\xa0 That is a deplorable technique or strategy, and it is one that we have strongly condemned and continue to condemn.\xc2\xa0 What we have also been clear about, and as that statement laid out in very plain terms, that suspicion that Hamas fighters are operating in the vicinity of innocent civilians does not justify taking strikes that put the lives of those innocent civilians at risk.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask on one other topic.\xc2\xa0 Some colleagues of mine have a report out about the administration using young people -- dispatching young people to Cuba under the cover of public health or civic programs, basically with the goal of ginning up a rebellion there.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the administration thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to use public health programs in particular as cover for political goals.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie, I have seen that the USAID has put out a statement on this correcting some of the things that were included in that report.\xc2\xa0 So I know that many -- that the subject of that report was related to some ongoing USAID programs, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you USAID to walk you through the details of those programs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware that USAID would have been using both health and civic programs for these political goals?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm every aspect of those reports, because I believe that there are some aspects of those reports that are not quite accurate.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of sussing out the true aims of these programs, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the agency that runs them -- in this case, that\xe2\x80\x99s USAID.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Talking about immigration for a second. In the debate over the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive action and his unilateral actions, the White House has defended them, saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken fewer actions than his predecessors.\xc2\xa0 But I wonder if you would address the issue of scope for a second.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be at all deterred from taking action that could have as widespread consequences as providing work permits to as many as 5 million people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, to answer that question it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the context in which we\xe2\x80\x99re having this discussion.\xc2\xa0 More than a year ago, the United States Senate, working closely with this administration, working closely with the law enforcement community, the business community, the evangelical community, cobbled together a compromise piece of legislation that would bring about a wide range of common-sense reforms of our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 That is a compromise proposal that was passed through the Senate more than one year ago.\xc2\xa0 Since then, we have seen House Republicans engage in a legislative strategy to prevent that bill from coming to the floor of the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>We know that if that bill were allowed to be considered by the House of Representatives that it would pass with a bipartisan majority of votes.\xc2\xa0 But the House Republican leadership and some of the more extreme elements of the House Republican conference have prevented that from happening.\xc2\xa0 So again, they\xe2\x80\x99re not just opposing this compromise; they\xe2\x80\x99re not just willing to vote no on a common-sense piece of legislation; they\xe2\x80\x99re actually preventing all of their colleagues from casting a vote on this common-sense piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>What the President has done is he has worked with Republicans in the House over the course of the last year to try to convince them to drop their opposition -- and again, not necessarily to try to convince them to vote yes, but rather just to allow them and allow their colleagues in the House of Representatives to render their judgment on this compromise.\xc2\xa0 The President also indicated a willingness to work with Republicans if they could identify some of their own priorities that they would prefer to include.\xc2\xa0 But despite the President\xe2\x80\x99s openness to having these kinds of conversations over the course of the last 12 or 13 months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen absolutely no movement on this issue among House Republicans.</p>\n<p>So what the President has said and what he has concluded is that he is no longer willing to stand idly by while the House Republicans block common-sense reforms to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And so what the President has done is he has directed his Secretary of Homeland Security and his Attorney General to consider what kinds of options are available to the President in the context of the current law to try to mitigate some of the problems that are caused by a broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At this point, because that review is still ongoing, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to speculate about what that review might ultimately conclude.\xc2\xa0 The time frame for that review is the end of the summer, and the President expects to carefully consider their review and act on it relatively quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jumping to an international topic with regard to the Ebola virus outbreak in Africa, does the United States plan to provide any funding to help address that issue, as international financial institutions have announced this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, when this outbreak initially occurred back in March, the Centers for Disease Control was in close -- was acting in close coordination with the World Health Organization and other multilateral organizations that were trying to confront this outbreak to address the problem where it had occurred.\xc2\xa0 That coordination continues.</p>\n<p>I know that the CDC announced earlier today the deployment of additional resources to the region to try to stem this outbreak.\xc2\xa0 This is, as the CDC has assessed, probably the most damaging and dangerous outbreak of Ebola that we have seen so far, and that is why it requires a significant international response.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these actions taken by the CDC, the World Health Organization, and others to try to bring additional resources to address this problem in this region in Africa where it has occurred.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the same subject, there have been some calls kind of rattling around out there for the U.S. to block flights from countries that have been affected by Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the U.S. is at all considering at this point, or would consider if it gets worse?\xc2\xa0 And can you be a little bit more specific about any additional actions DHS is taking at American airports to try to stop it from getting in here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me give you a -- try to give you a better sense of how we\xe2\x80\x99re confronting this problem and ensuring that the homeland remains safe.</p>\n<p>First of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that there is a screening process that individuals have to go through when they board aircraft departing the countries where this outbreak has been reported.\xc2\xa0 There is additional screening that occurs when individuals who started in that region of the world arrive in this country.\xc2\xa0 To bolster that screening effort, the CDC has been involved in training CBP officers who are on the front lines of this to make sure they understand and that they have been trained on the symptoms of this illness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important for the public to understand that the reason that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to identify the symptoms is you\xe2\x80\x99re not contagious unless you exhibit the symptoms of this disease.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what differentiates [it] from a common cold or the flu, where, of course, individuals can be contagious before they start exhibiting the symptoms.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important for people to understand that this disease is not transmitted through the air, it\xe2\x80\x99s not transmitted through the water, and it would not be transmitted through food here in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the CDC has assessed that there\xe2\x80\x99s no significant risk to the United States from this current Ebola outbreak.\xc2\xa0 But because there are CBP officers who are carefully monitoring passengers who are arriving from these countries, we are in a position to ensure that public health is protected.\xc2\xa0 If CBP officers do recognize an individual who appears to be exhibiting some of these symptoms, there are facilities at these ports of entry, at these airports, where individuals can be quarantined and evaluated by medical personnel.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard some raise questions about the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that\xe2\x80\x99s being hosted here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 There are some individuals from these countries where this outbreak has occurred who are participating in the summit.\xc2\xa0 The United States Secret Service and the State Department have ensured that their officers are properly trained to identify individuals who are exhibiting these symptoms.\xc2\xa0 There have been briefings that have been held with public health officials and with medical professionals and facilities here in the national capital region to make sure that if, again if, an individual is starting to exhibit these symptoms, that individual can be quarantined and get the kind of health care that they need.</p>\n<p>The experts tell us at the CDC -- tell us that if health care workers are meticulous about meeting basic guidelines for protecting themselves from bodily fluids and other things that could lead to a transmission of the virus, then even those health care professionals will be safe as well.</p>\n<p>So there are in place a lot of precautions to ensure the safety of the American public and of the traveling public, in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no need to consider at this point stopping flights coming in from those three countries or so?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not at this point.\xc2\xa0 At this point, there are screenings that are in place both before individuals board flights in their home countries or where these flights originate, but also after these individuals arrive here in the United States they\xe2\x80\x99re screened once again.\xc2\xa0 And there are facilities available that if an individual is detected exhibiting these symptoms, that they can be quarantined and promptly evaluated by a medical professional.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Julie brought it up, on just the U.S.-Israel relationship right now -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of analysis out there about the difficulty in the relationship.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some tough talk even on Israel.\xc2\xa0 But I think it just seems like as tough as the talk can be, there\xe2\x80\x99s very little that the U.S. can do.\xc2\xa0 So again, would you describe this situation and this relationship as frustrating right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think right now the way that I would describe the violence that we see in this region, Michelle, [is] as tragic; that we have seen extraordinary loss of life on both sides of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that people I think around the world right now recognize is terrible and something that needs to come to an end quickly.\xc2\xa0 That is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen U.S. diplomats and others working so intensively to try to bring both sides together and put in place a cease-fire.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the relationship between the United States and Israel, Israel continues to be one of this country\xe2\x80\x99s strongest allies.\xc2\xa0 And you saw that sentiment reciprocated in the remarks delivered by Prime Minister Netanyahu over the weekend, where he praised the United States for the level of support that United States is providing to our ally.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned our strong statements condemning acts of terror and condemning the tactics of Hamas to fire rockets at innocent Israeli civilians.\xc2\xa0 He discussed the strong military-to-military relationship that exists between the United States and Israel.\xc2\xa0 He talked about our frequent expression of support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend itself and their citizens.\xc2\xa0 And you heard the Prime Minister mention the United States\xe2\x80\x99 close coordination with Israeli Defense Forces in operating the Iron Dome System that has shot down scores of Hamas rockets that were aimed squarely at Israeli civilians, thereby protecting the lives of countless Israeli civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the nature of our relationship is strong and unchanged.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the border supplemental now and next steps?\xc2\xa0 Will you try to negotiate that as a separate bill in September, or part of the CR maybe, the ongoing appropriations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, you may have noticed late on Friday that DHS did make an announcement about the need to reprogram some of their funds to ensure that necessary resources could be focused on addressing this problem at the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We do continue to be pretty disappointed in the failure of House Republicans, principally, to act on a piece of legislation that would provide the government the resources that are necessary to deal with a problem that many Republicans themselves describe as a crisis.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we saw House Republicans take what I thought was a pretty remarkable step to pass a piece of legislation that would not just tie the hands of the President moving forward but actually would attempt to undo some of the things that the President has already done to address one of the most significant problems with our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>The consequence of the measure that was passed by House Republicans would actually take law enforcement resources that are currently directed to prioritize individuals who pose a threat to or could pose a threat to public safety and divert them away from that task and focus them on deporting young people who are American in every way except in their papers.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who would be deported back to a country that many of them don\'t even remember.</p>\n<p>And the fact that House Republicans support diverting law enforcement resources away from possible threats to our public safety and targeting them at young people I think is an indication of just how wrong their priorities are for the country.\xc2\xa0 This is not just my view, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out.\xc2\xa0 I noticed over the weekend that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops put out what I think is a pretty strong statement on this measure.\xc2\xa0 The said -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting the bishops here -- they said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sad day for our country.\xc2\xa0 A chamber of Congress is poised to send vulnerable children back to danger and possible death.\xc2\xa0 It violates our commitment to human rights and due process of law, and lessens us as a nation.\xc2\xa0 I pray that this legislation never sees the light of day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So I think that is a pretty strong statement from a non-partisan group -- a group that this administration has not always agreed with, but in this case, I would certainly associate myself with this statement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you do now?\xc2\xa0 How are you going to get these funds?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, it\xe2\x80\x99s now been, I believe, four or five weeks since we put forward a very detailed proposal about what it is we thought was necessary to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 We certainly would like to see Congress take action on our proposal.\xc2\xa0 We laid out in very clear detail what exactly was necessary, and Republicans in the House didn\xe2\x80\x99t act on it. Instead, they passed a different piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 In the Senate, we saw Republicans do everything that they could do to block a Democratic proposal that was patterned on the proposal that this administration had put forward.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of legislation, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out, that got 50 votes in the United States Senate, but because of the rules of the Senate and the efforts by Senate Republicans to block that legislation, won\xe2\x80\x99t actually pass.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty disappointed about that.\xc2\xa0 But what it does is it adds even more conviction to the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that if Congress is not going to take steps to try to address these problems, then he is going to consider whatever steps he can take within the confines of the law to address this problem on his own.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress decides to return from their August recess after Labor Day and to take action to address some of these challenges that everybody acknowledges exists, then we would welcome that action.\xc2\xa0 But the President is not going to sit around waiting for Congress -- or congressional Republicans in this case -- to act.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to kind of follow on border and immigration.\xc2\xa0 And I guess my question was, do you guys see a political advantage in differentiating yourself from House Republicans on this issue?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that voters are going to punish House Republicans for their -- for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done on border and immigration in either the midterms or 2016?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on here at the White House are the -- is frankly, to put it bluntly, solving problems.\xc2\xa0 And this is a problem that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill acknowledge exists but that has not changed the posture of congressional Republicans from trying to block every step that can be taken to address this problem.</p>\n<p>I know that there are some Republicans who are concerned about the political impact of this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t often read the Wall Street Journal editorial page, but I happened to read a little bit of it this weekend.\xc2\xa0 They said that the Republicans, again, \xe2\x80\x9cgave the country the impression that its highest priority is to deport as many children as rapidly as possible back from wherever they came.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They continued to say, \xe2\x80\x9cA party whose preoccupation is deporting children is going to alienate many conservatives, never mind minority voters.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So I think that the Wall Street Journal is concerned about the political impact that this could have for Republicans, and I think that they do so acknowledging that this is not just a move and a policy that is going to be unpopular with minority voters, it\'s actually a policy that\'s going to be unpopular and even alienate -- to use their word -- many conservation voters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I mean, so you guys maybe are concerned about policy, but also obviously about politics.\xc2\xa0 The President goes and fund-raises all the time.\xc2\xa0 So I guess my question is, is that an accomplishment for the President -- if what the Wall Street Journal editorial page said is true -- to sort of consolidate the Hispanic vote, or voters who are concerned about this issue within the Democratic Party?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys are actively interested in, or working on, or is it part of the consideration as you go through this process of drafting a possible executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re focused on solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there are many Republicans who are suspicious of the President\xe2\x80\x99s political motives.\xc2\xa0 I think that that applies to just about any policy issue that the President considers.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to that point of view, but the fact of the matter is that\'s why it\'s so significant that the proposal that the President has championed, the comprehensive immigration reform legislation that passed through the Senate, is legislation that was supported by 14 Republicans in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s supported by even evangelicals all across the country.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that they don\'t share the same political goals as the President, but they share the President\xe2\x80\x99s support for that compromise piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The same could be said of the business community and even the law enforcement community.\xc2\xa0 These are not communities that are packed necessarily with progressive or even Democratic voters, but yet they support the proposal that the President supports.</p>\n<p>So I think the President alluded to this in his comments on Friday when he said that the dispute right now or the debate right now is not between congressional Republicans and the President of the United States; it is a dispute between congressional Republicans on one side and the President on the same side as Senate Republicans -- or at least more than a dozen Senate Republicans -- leaders in the law enforcement community, leaders in the evangelical community, leaders in the business community.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that, again, the President is not interested in playing politics on this issue, he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in solving problems.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to the Africa summit somewhat and security.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about what you know with the efforts with, I guess, Nigeria and Cameroon when it comes to trying to defeat Boko Haram and deal with finding the girls, as well as finding the wife of the vice prime minister who was taken by Boko Haram as well from Cameroon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, you\xe2\x80\x99ll note that in the opening remarks that I delivered, one of the focal points of the leaders summit will be on security.\xc2\xa0 The United States has many deep security ties with countries across Africa, and there are steps that we have announced to deal with -- or at least coordinate with African countries who have the lead in dealing with some of these challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, Boko Haram does pose a significant threat to security in many of these countries in Africa.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the United States -- after the high-profile abduction of some 300 girls from a school in Africa led the United States to commit additional resources, including some military resources, to assist the Nigerian government in search for those girls.</p>\n<p>So we remain engaged and working with local governments in Africa to confront this significant challenge.\xc2\xa0 And again, one of the goals of this conference is to discuss security issues.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have any specific meetings or anything to read out to you in advance, but a thorough discussion of security is on the agenda for this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to security, broader, beyond -- well, when it comes to security in Africa, beyond this summit, is this country working with Israel when it comes to dealing with terrorism?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from several countries in the last couple of days that they are working closely with Israel because they have more of a sense of -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with a lot of terrorism for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 And African countries are really looking to them and listening to them.\xc2\xa0 Is America working with Israel when it comes to the African situation with Boko Haram and terrorism there on the continent?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific programs or conversations like that, but I do think that I can say as a general matter that we are interested in working with African countries to help them bring greater security to their countries and to individual communities in their countries.</p>\n<p>We recognize here in the United States the significant threat to security that Boko Haram poses.\xc2\xa0 And we are interested in working with the leadership of these countries to professionalize their security operations and do a better job of ensuring the safety and security of their people as they confront the threats of these terrorists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, is it believed that the girls are still alive?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on their status or what our latest assessment is of their status.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department who may be able to give you an update on that.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just back to the immigration question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve made a case here -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it before -- that the American public supports immigration reform, that there\xe2\x80\x99s support enough in Congress to pass it; if only a bill would come up for a vote, it would pass and would be signed into law.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, if it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that that set of facts as you see them affects the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of what he is able to do and what he is permitted to do to act on his own.\xc2\xa0 In other words, does that change the calculus given that your assessment -- again, popular support, more than enough support to pass it in Congress, if only it weren\xe2\x80\x99t being unfairly blocked -- does that therefore give the President some broader powers to act on his own?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the assessment of what powers the President can wield on his own to address this problem is something that will be determined by legal experts, in this case under the leadership of the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I do think that as a practical matter, the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to act where Congress has failed is strengthened by the fact that there is such broad support all across the country for trying to impose common-sense solutions to a problem or a set of problems that everybody acknowledges exists.\xc2\xa0 But the scope of possible -- or potential executive actions that could be taken to address some of these problems is something that will be determined by the legal review that is still ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this way.\xc2\xa0 The President several times</p>\n<p>-- and from this podium, your predecessor several times -- when asked by advocacy groups for immigration reform why doesn\'t the President act alone, why doesn\'t he do what he did under DACA for the whole spectrum, the whole population of those who are in country illegally -- does the President still stand by those statements?\xc2\xa0 Does he still think that, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done what I can -- as he\xe2\x80\x99s said in the past, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done what I can on my own; I can\xe2\x80\x99t do further.\xc2\xa0 What needs to happen now is legislative action -- or has that view changed?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view has not changed.\xc2\xa0 The only thing that has changed is that for a period of time that extended more than a year, there was an opportunity for Congress to take action to address these problems.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that all of the -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it this way:\xc2\xa0 Any of the problems -- or any of the potential actions that the President could take would not be as enduring or robust as policies that can be put in place by Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just the way that our system is structured.</p>\n<p>And legislation in this area would have a more far-lasting impact on these problems than any sort of executive action that the President would be able to take.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President has been pretty transparent about saying, look, by the end of the summer I\xe2\x80\x99m going to consider a review that\'s been conducted by the AG and the Secretary of Homeland Security, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take what steps are within the confines of the law for me to mitigate some of problems that are posed by the broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If, however, Congress returns from their August recess, comes to their senses and decides that they actually should consider a common-sense set of reforms for our broken immigration system, the President would be happy for that piece of legislation to supersede the executive actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to address this problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this doesn\'t eliminate the need for Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 It just reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to acting where Congress has refused.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just get very specific.\xc2\xa0 What he said one of the times he was heckled by a pro-immigration reform group, he said that if he could solve this problem on his own, he would; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6but we\xe2\x80\x99re also a nation of laws.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of our tradition.\xc2\xa0 And so the easy way out is to try and yell and pretend like I could do something by violating our laws.\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal you want to achieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Has that view changed?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he was pretty forthright saying, look, I can\'t do it.\xc2\xa0 It would be violating the law if I did it on my own.\xc2\xa0 Congress has to act.\xc2\xa0 But now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a case that Congress is not going to act, does the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on that change?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it has not changed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason is simply this, Jon -- that Congress has a greater capacity to solve this problem than the President does through executive actions.\xc2\xa0 There is more that Congress can do.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I remember that event.\xc2\xa0 I believe that was -- are you reading from the transcript of the President\xe2\x80\x99s event in San Francisco?\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what that is, from last fall.\xc2\xa0 And the President did have a very -- I think it was a pretty emotional exchange.\xc2\xa0 There was a pretty emotional outburst from somebody in the audience.\xc2\xa0 And what the President observed -- and that was a time frame in which there was still an opportunity and Republicans were still signaling a willingness to consider the common-sense proposal that had already passed through the Senate.</p>\n<p>Anything that the President is able to do using his executive action will not be as powerful and as long-lasting as the reforms that are contemplated by this bipartisan proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s already passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But what the President has said is, even if I can\xe2\x80\x99t do all of that because I can\xe2\x80\x99t, because the law will not allow me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask my team, the experts -- the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General -- to review the law and figure out what is it the President can do within the confines of the current law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is going to encourage them to cast a wide net, consider a wide range of ideas.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to that review and looks forward to acting on it quickly after he receives it.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when people heard the President say, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, what he was really saying is, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not do it.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s always believed he could do this and could go down this road and use executive power.\xc2\xa0 His preference and what he stated was really a preference, not a limitation.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, there are limitations that are under -- within the confines of the current law.\xc2\xa0 Congress can do more to address this problem than the President can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President has said is, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to direct my Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to consider what I\xe2\x80\x99m able to do under the current law.\xc2\xa0 What that will be is maybe some options to mitigate some of the problems that we see with our broken immigration system, but not as much as Congress can do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, you talked about 4.5 or 5 million people receiving a temporary work permit that never existed before that isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of the legislative process, that is executive fiat.\xc2\xa0 That is a scope of executive power never before seen on an issue like this.\xc2\xa0 And what I think people thought they heard the President saying is, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xc2\xa0 What he was actually saying is, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what he was saying -- and I think this is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try this one more time.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President was saying is, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do what Congress is talking about doing right now; I do not have the authority under the current law to take the kinds of steps that Congress is debating right now.\xc2\xa0 The steps that Congress was debating at that time were steps that would have a far-reaching impact on our broken immigration system; that it would repair very serious problems that exist with our immigration system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you agree that 4.5 to 5 million work permits would also be far-reaching in its impact?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about specific proposals because, again, the review about what the President is able to do is still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 So it remains an open question whether these proposals that are floated by a wide variety of advocates on this issue is something that falls within the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to act on.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let the legal experts render a judgment on that and consider what options are available to the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The only thing I know now is that the options that will be presented to the President will not be as enduring and will not be as successful at reforming our broken immigration system as the law that was passed in bipartisan fashion by the Congress -- or by the Senate, but is currently being blocked by Republicans in the House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the statement released by the State Department yesterday, does the administration interpret that as a new signal to Israel about tactical limitations the United States believes it now must follow; that is to say, suspicion is no longer justification for any shelling?\xc2\xa0 Not something I believe I heard the administration ever say as specifically as it said in that statement yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is there a rhetorical limit now you are trying to impose on the tactical flexibility Israel has to prosecute this war?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The limits that are imposed on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s ability to tactically execute this war are the standards that the Israeli military themselves have put in place.\xc2\xa0 And what we are encouraging them to do is to live up to those standards and in some cases do ever more to live up to those standards.</p>\n<p>So we resolutely defend Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend themselves and to take the kinds of military steps that they assess are necessary to protect their citizens.\xc2\xa0 They have a responsibility to do that.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the tactical execution, they have put in place very serious standards for the protection of civilians, and the United States has been steadfast in encouraging them to live up those standards and in some cases do more to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re living up to those standards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the course of this conflict, has Israel in any respect lived up to those standards?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that it is evident that Israel can and should do more to live up to those standards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it has not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So what we believe is that Israel can and should do more to live up to the standards that they themselves have set for the safety and security of innocent Palestinian civilians.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on executive action, because on Friday the President seemed to suggest the barometer for this is how many executive orders you issue, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested as well.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6despite the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken fewer executive actions than my Republican predecessor or my Democratic predecessor before that\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real issue the scope, as was suggested earlier, and whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re going around current law rather than just simply numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What this President believes -- well, I guess the other way that we can measure this, Ed, is by evaluating the record of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And there was a lot of commentary over the weekend that indicated that this Republican Congress fell far short of the standard that was set, even by the do-nothing Congress of the last century.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President is dealing with is a Congress that is refusing to act on a whole range of priorities that are shared by Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 So what the President has said is that the President will not allow congressional inaction to stymie that progress of this nation.\xc2\xa0 And the President has widely considered, on a range of policy issues, steps that he can take within the confines of the law and within the confines of his executive authority to try to make progress on behalf of the American people -- mostly in those situations, middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has prioritized, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President take a number of steps to advance their interests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say then that the trigger for executive action likely this fall, end of the summer on immigration reform, like on other issues, is that the House Republicans fail to act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is the trigger.\xc2\xa0 Because House Republicans are blocking common-sense reforms that have already been passed through the Senate, the President is not going to stand by and not allow any solutions to be put in place.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to consider what solutions he can put in place within the confines of the law.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned to Major, the solutions will not be as far-reaching as legislation would allow, but they may be in a position to mitigate some of the problems of our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And the President is no longer going to wait for Congress to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if the trigger is congressional inaction, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President take executive action on immigration back in 2009 or 2010 when House Democrats failed to act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because the President was committed to trying to work through Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think this is evidence that the President has been very patient.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they had two years.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid -- they were running the House and Senate.\xc2\xa0 The first two years of this administration the President vowed back in 2008, by the end of my first year in office we\xe2\x80\x99ll pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That was his promise.\xc2\xa0 So they failed to act for two years.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he do anything then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say a couple things about that, Ed.\xc2\xa0 The first is that at the time -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall back in 2009 there were many things on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plate --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As there are now.\xc2\xa0 Israel, Gaza, Syria, the economy -- he has a lot going on now, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 But I think that the crisis that we faced in 2009 as it related to our financial system and our economy hemorrhaging jobs, that that was understandably the focal point of congressional activity but also a lot of activity here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we would have liked to have seen immigration reform get done years ago.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- again, that is also something that is shared by Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 All the more reason it is completely unreasonable for House Republicans to continue to block common-sense reforms that have strong bipartisan support all across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said several times here we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on solving problems, when you were ask about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you had a chance -- you had the House, Senate and White House in 2009, 2010.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you focus on solving immigration problems then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And my point is, Ed, that there were a lot of other crises that the President was focused on at that point.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on now is trying to find common-sense solution, bipartisan solutions to a problem that a wide variety, a wide majority of Americans acknowledge exist at this point.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cend of summer\xe2\x80\x9d earlier.\xc2\xa0 Is that when the President is going to announce a decision?\xc2\xa0 Or is that when all of the recommendations from Cabinet members are coming to him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that is when we anticipate this review that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General will be received by the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be about when probably?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roughly the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is September 20?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave -- I acknowledge that that time frame is open to some interpretation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant you that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a little bit more specific.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to be much more specific about that from here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let me say this that I think will do a little bit more to answer your question:\xc2\xa0 We do anticipate that we will receive the review around the end of the summer, and I do anticipate that the President will act on those recommendations shortly after receiving them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a follow up.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to consult the Attorney General on what legally he can do through the executive orders.\xc2\xa0 To what extent is he limited in his actions by lack of money?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 Once the President is able to evaluate -- based on the recommendations of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General -- the options that are available to him, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be a discussion of resources and whether or not there are sufficient resources to take some of these steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can only reprogram so much.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 I think that sort of highlights the point that Jon and Major were highlighting, which is that congressional action to addressing this problem would be -- is vastly preferable.\xc2\xa0 Congress has the power of the purse.\xc2\xa0 They could ensure that the necessary resources are devoted to solving so many of the problems that are created by our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>The other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is that there are obvious economic benefits to taking the kinds of steps that were contemplated by the Congress that would reduce the deficit, it would create jobs, that it would expand economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are all good things.\xc2\xa0 These are the reasons that you see groups -- particularly the business community -- be so strongly supportive of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But again, for reasons that are not clear to me, many Republicans have not found that to be particularly persuasive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 In the many conversations between U.S. government officials and Israeli officials over the past couple of days, has the American -- has the White House or any American official received any assurances from the Israelis that they will work -- that they will try to live up to those standards that you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly cited?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Zeke, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out any private conversations between U.S. officials and their Israeli counterparts.\xc2\xa0 I did hear in the remarks that the Prime Minister delivered over the weekend a commitment to ensuring that the Israeli military lives up to those standards and is doing the kinds of things that protect the lives of innocent civilians on the Palestinian side.\xc2\xa0 That stands in pretty stark contrast to the tactics that are employed by Hamas and other affiliated groups that are using their rockets and aiming them squarely at Israeli civilians in the hopes of provoking a wide range of casualties among the civilian population there.</p>\n<p>So their tactics are clearly different.\xc2\xa0 But the Israeli Prime Minister in his remarks indicated not just a willingness but a desire to live up to those standards that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about here today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a couple of days now since the latest round of sanctions on Russia, wanting to effect those sectoral sanctions that you said would be so painful for the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen any indications yet that the Russian government is pushing back or pulling back its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, or any concrete economic impacts on the Russian regime in the past -- since these sanctions have been put in place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury Department, who is more closely watching the economic impact of these sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We have over the longer term seen a range of data to indicate that there is an economic impact that\xe2\x80\x99s being felt by the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Central Bank of Russia spend billions of dollars to try to shore up the strength of their currency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a pretty large increase in capital flight from Russia.\xc2\xa0 There are concerns about whether or not that is -- among the investor community about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s a safe place to try to invest some money.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a lot of the impartial international evaluators of the health of the Russian economy revise down their projections for economic growth in Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a range of indications that highlight the impact that this sanctions regime has had on the economy.\xc2\xa0 In terms of its impact on the calculus of the Putin regime, as it relates to their activities in Ukraine, we have not seen the kinds of actions that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 Again, we would like to see Russia not engage in the kind of destabilizing activities along the Ukraine border that have led to that escalating conflict.\xc2\xa0 And we would like to see them use their influence with the Russian separatists to abide by a cease-fire agreement and pursue a diplomatic resolution.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the Russians take the necessary steps to close their border to the transfer of heavy weapons.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the kinds of concrete steps that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.</p>\n<p>But again, this is not the kind of thing that -- this is not the kind of policy that can be evaluated on 24 or 48 hours\xe2\x80\x99 notice, but rather the kind of thing that can be evaluated over the course of weeks and months.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask you a quick question about the Africa summit and anything you might have on any added meetings or sideline meetings that might be going on to address the crisis, the Ebola crisis.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any specific meetings that are dedicated to that topic.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 They may be able to shed some more light on those kinds of activities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a little more on the timing of any possible executive orders, particularly as they relate to the border and your comment that maybe Congress will come back from the August recess and come to its senses.\xc2\xa0 Is there any implication that the President is unlikely to move before Congress returns?\xc2\xa0 Or is that timing very fluid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would describe that timing as fluid.\xc2\xa0 And again, the reason that I worded it that way is that even if the President does take some executive action prior to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s return, the President would be happy to have those executive actions superseded by passing the common-sense Senate reform -- Senate immigration reform bill that passed more than a year ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, any steps the President could take would not be as far-reaching as that Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 And if congressional Republicans come back from the recess, even just come to their senses enough, not necessarily to even support the bill, but just allow the bill to come up for a vote, the President would be happy to sign that bill into law and allow it to supersede any of the policy consequences of the executive actions that he takes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a real quick one on the redactions on the upcoming report on the enhanced interrogation techniques, and the criticism from some Democrats on the Intelligence Committee who say that these redactions, which are about 15 percent, make the report virtually unreadable.\xc2\xa0 Your comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective here.\xc2\xa0 This is his administration that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Prior to assuming the office of the presidency, the President -- then Senator Obama -- was pretty forward-leaning in his criticism of some of the tactics that were reportedly used during that era.</p>\n<p>Upon taking office, within a week or so, the President took executive action to ensure that those techniques would never again be used.\xc2\xa0 And he was -- he has long advocated the declassification and release of this report because it would send a clear signal to the American people and to the international community that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to own up -- as a country -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to own up to what occurred so that we can ensure that even in very difficult times that it doesn\'t happen again.</p>\n<p>So that is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view here.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been very forward-leaning in terms of trying to be as transparent as possible with the American public about what exactly occurred and with the international community about what exactly occurred so that we can prevent it from happening again.</p>\n<p>Now, there are some necessary -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about very sensitive information here.\xc2\xa0 And it is important that a declassification process be carried out that protects sources and methods and other information that is critical to our national security.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the intelligence community has worked through a very rigorous process to ensure that those pieces of information are protected.</p>\n<p>I would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the criticism, and again from Democrats, is that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about protecting sources and methods; it\xe2\x80\x99s redacting material -- basic source material that makes it impossible to understand the report.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, more than 85 percent of the report was un-redacted, and half of the redactions that occurred were actually just in the footnotes.\xc2\xa0 So this is an indication that there was a good-faith effort that was made by the administration and by national security professionals to evaluate this information and to make redactions that are consistent with the need to protect national security, but also consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s clearly stated desire to be as transparent as possible about this.</p>\n<p>That all being said, this administration and the relevant national security agencies have indicated a willingness to sit down with those who have spoken out about this just in the last couple of days to try to find some common ground here and satisfy their concerns so that we can get this report released as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we know when that might take place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the intelligence community about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you have any comment on -- Jim Brady\xe2\x80\x99s family has put out a statement saying the former press secretary has passed away.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if you have any reflections, given how new you are to the job.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I had not seen that.\xc2\xa0 That may have just happened.\xc2\xa0 I was aware that Mr. Brady was in failing health in recent days, and I was saddened when I first learned of that. He is somebody who I think really revolutionized this job.\xc2\xa0 And even after he was wounded in that attack on the President, was somebody who showed his patriotism and commitment to the country by being very outspoken on an issue that was important to him and that he felt very strongly about.</p>\n<p>So he is -- he leaves the kind of legacy that I think -- that certainly this press secretary and all future press secretaries will aspire to live up to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more to say about this on paper later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the Afghan elections, it continues to have a bumpy process as far as the counting of votes are concerned.\xc2\xa0 Is it concerning to you?\xc2\xa0 Or what\xe2\x80\x99s the problem? How do you think about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the auditing of the election results?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, counting of the election results.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got it, yet.\xc2\xa0 They just started.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did just start.\xc2\xa0 After a break for the Eid holiday, the election audit has resumed.\xc2\xa0 And both candidates are participating with candidate agents observing the process.\xc2\xa0 The audit continues to be conducted by the Afghan Independent Elections Commission under the close supervision of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned both Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani to express continued support for the Afghan electoral process and the framework for a government of national unity as agreed to on his last visit to that country.\xc2\xa0 He stressed the urgency of accelerating the post-election audit and implementing the political framework agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we have said many times is that we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the Afghan people to have confidence in their electoral institutions.\xc2\xa0 And by conducting this audit, which both candidates have agreed to -- this is an audit of every ballot that was cast in that presidential election, so no small undertaking -- that will only enhance confidence in the political system in Afghanistan, and thereby will enhance confidence in that country\xe2\x80\x99s next leader.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that both candidates remain engaged in this process and are going to be supportive of both candidates and of that process in general as it works its way to completion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to these two candidates or President Karzai of late?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not in the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 There have been a couple of conversations between the President and both candidates in the election to encourage them to remain engaged in the process.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any recent telephone calls to read out to you other than the call that was placed by the Secretary of State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:56 P.M.
