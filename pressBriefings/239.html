EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday was a historic day.\xc2\xa0 The comprehensive, long-term deal that we achieved with our allies and partners to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon represents a powerful display of American leadership and diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 It shows what we can accomplish when we lead from a position of strength and a position of principle, when we unite the international community around a shared vision, and we resolve to solve problems peacefully.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I said yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American people and Congress to get a full opportunity to review this deal.\xc2\xa0 That process is now underway.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve already reached out to leaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 My national security team has begun offering extensive briefings.\xc2\xa0 I expect the debate to be robust -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be.\xc2\xa0 This is an important issue.\xc2\xa0 Our national security policies are stronger and more effective when they are subject to the scrutiny and transparency that democracy demands.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I said yesterday, the details of this deal matter very much.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why our team worked so hard for so long to get the details right.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, as this debate unfolds, I hope we don\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of the larger picture -- the opportunity that this agreement represents.\xc2\xa0 As we go forward, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everybody to remember the alternative and the fundamental choice that this moment represents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this deal, we cut off every single one of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pathways to a nuclear program -- a nuclear weapons program, and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program will be under severe limits for many years.\xc2\xa0 Without a deal, those pathways remain open; there would be no limits on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and Iran could move closer to a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this deal, we gain unprecedented, around-the-clock monitoring of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s key nuclear facilities and the most comprehensive and intrusive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated.\xc2\xa0 Without a deal, those inspections go away, and we lose the ability to closely monitor Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program and detect any covert nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this deal, if Iran violates its commitments, there will be real consequences.\xc2\xa0 Nuclear-related sanctions that have helped to cripple the Iranian economy will snap back into place.\xc2\xa0 Without a deal, the international sanctions regime will unravel, with little ability to re-impose them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this deal, we have the possibility of peacefully resolving a major threat to regional and international security.\xc2\xa0 Without a deal, we risk even more war in the Middle East, and other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I said yesterday, even with this deal, we will continue to have profound differences with Iran -- its support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize parts of the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, the multilateral arms embargo on Iran will remain in place for an additional five years, and restrictions on ballistic missile technology will remain for eight years.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the United States will maintain our own sanctions related to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights violations.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue our unprecedented security cooperation with Israel and continue to deepen our partnerships with the Gulf States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the bottom line is this:\xc2\xa0 This nuclear deal meets the national security interests of the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0 It prevents the most serious threat -- Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, which would only make the other problems that Iran may cause even worse.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why this deal makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the alternative -- no limits on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, no inspections, an Iran that\xe2\x80\x99s closer to a nuclear weapon, the risk of a regional nuclear arms race and a greater risk of war -- all that would endanger our security.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the choice that we face.\xc2\xa0 If we don\xe2\x80\x99t choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly for letting this moment slip away.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd no one suggests that this deal resolves all the threats that Iran poses to its neighbors or the world.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, realizing the promise of this deal will require many years of implementation and hard work.\xc2\xa0 It will require vigilance and execution.\xc2\xa0 But this deal is our best means of assuring that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And, from the start, that has been my number-one priority, our number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a historic chance to pursue a safer and more secure world -- an opportunity that may not come again in our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 As President and as Commander-in-Chief, I am determined to seize that opportunity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take some questions.\xc2\xa0 And let me see who I\xe2\x80\x99m starting off with.\xc2\xa0 Here you go.\xc2\xa0 I got it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew Beatty, AFP.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you said the deal offered a chance at a new direction in relations with Iran.\xc2\xa0 What steps will you take to enable a more moderate Iran?\xc2\xa0 And does this deal allow you to more forcefully counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing actions in the region quite aside from the nuclear question?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Andrew, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, just because I suspect that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a common set of questions that are touched on -- I promise I will get to your question, but I want to start off just by stepping back and reminding folks of what is at stake here.\xc2\xa0 And I already did in my opening statement, but I just want to reiterate it because I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard already some of the objections to the deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe starting premise of our strategy with respect to Iran has been that it would be a grave threat to the United States and to our allies if they obtained a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And so everything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over the last six and a half years has been designed to make sure that we address that number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the sanctions regime was all about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we were able to mobilize the international community, including some folks that we are not particularly close to, to abide by these sanctions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how these crippling sanctions came about, was because we were able to gain global consensus that Iran having a nuclear weapon would be a problem for everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s accounts got frozen and they were not able to get money for the oil sales that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that they had problems operating with respect to international commerce -- because we built that international consensus around this very specific, narrow, but profound issue -- the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, by the way, that was not simply my priority.\xc2\xa0 If you look back at all the debates that have taken place over the last five, six years, this has been a Democratic priority, this has been a Republican priority, this has been Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s priority.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been our Gulf allies\xe2\x80\x99 priority -- is making sure Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal negotiated by John Kerry, Wendy Sherman, Ernie Moniz, our allies, our partners, the P5+1 achieves that goal.\xc2\xa0 It achieves our top priority -- making sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 But we have always recognized that even if Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a nuclear weapon, Iran still poses challenges to our interests and our values, both in the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when this deal gets implemented, we know that we will have dismantled the immediate concerns around Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We will have brought their stockpiles down to 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 We will have significantly reduced the number of centrifuges that they operate.\xc2\xa0 We will have installed an unprecedented inspections regime, and that will remain in place not just for 10 years but, for example, on the stockpiles, will continue to 15 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIran will have pledged to the international community that it will not develop a nuclear weapon and now will be subject to an Additional Protocol, a more vigorous inspection and monitoring regime that lasts in perpetuity.\xc2\xa0 We will have disabled a facility like Arak, the Arak facility, from allowing Iran to develop plutonium that could be used for a bomb.\xc2\xa0 We will have greatly reduced the stockpile of uranium that\xe2\x80\x99s enriched.\xc2\xa0 And we will have put in place inspections along the entire supply chain so that if uranium was diverted into a covert program we would catch it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I can say with confidence but, more importantly, nuclear experts can say with confidence that Iran will not be in a position to develop a nuclear bomb.\xc2\xa0 We will have met our number-one priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still have problems with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s sponsorship of terrorism; its funding of proxies like Hezbollah that threaten Israel and threaten the region; the destabilizing activities that they\'re engaging in, including in places like Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And my hope is that building on this deal we can continue to have conversations with Iran that incentivize them to behave differently in the region, to be less aggressive, less hostile, more cooperative, to operate the way we expect nations in the international community to behave.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not counting on it.\xc2\xa0 So this deal is not contingent on Iran changing its behavior.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not contingent on Iran suddenly operating like a liberal democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt solves one particular problem, which is making sure they don\'t have a bomb.\xc2\xa0 And the point I\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly made -- and is, I believe, hard to dispute -- is that it will be a lot easier for us to check Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nefarious activities, to push back against the other areas where they operate contrary to our interests or our allies\xe2\x80\x99 interests, if they don\'t have a bomb.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so will they change their behavior?\xc2\xa0 Will we seek to gain more cooperation from them in resolving issues like Syria, or what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq, to stop encouraging Houthis in Yemen?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to engage with them.\xc2\xa0 Although, keep in mind that unlike the Cuba situation, we\'re not normalizing diplomatic relations here.\xc2\xa0 So the contacts will continue to be limited.\xc2\xa0 But will we try to encourage them to take a more constructive path?\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not betting on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in fact, having resolved the nuclear issue, we will be in a stronger position to work with Israel, work with the Gulf countries, work with our other partners, work with the Europeans to bring additional pressure to bear on Iran around those issues that remain of concern.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the argument that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been already hearing -- and this was foreshadowed even before the deal was announced -- that because this deal does not solve all those other problems, that that\'s an argument for rejecting this deal, defies logic. \xc2\xa0It makes no sense.\xc2\xa0 And it loses sight of what was our original number-one priority, which is making sure that they don\'t have a bomb.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon Karl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, does it give you any pause to see this deal praised by Syrian dictator Assad as a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat victory for Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d or praised by those in Tehran who still shout \xe2\x80\x9cdeath to America,\xe2\x80\x9d and yet our closest ally in the Middle East calls it \xe2\x80\x9ca mistake of historic proportions\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 And here in Congress, it looks like a large majority will vote to reject this deal.\xc2\xa0 I know you can veto that rejection, but do you have any concerns about seeing a majority of the people\xe2\x80\x99s representatives in Congress saying that this is a bad deal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if I can just ask you quick political question, a very quick one.</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Donald --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Let me answer the question that you asked.\xc2\xa0 It does not give me pause that Mr. Assad or others in Tehran may be trying to spin the deal in a way that they think is favorable to what their constituencies want to hear.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what politicians do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case throughout.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that during the course of these negotiations over the last couple of months every time the Supreme Leader or somebody tweeted something out, for some reason we all bought into the notion, well, the Obama administration must be giving this or capitulating to that.\xc2\xa0 Well, now we have a document so you can see what the deal is.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to speculate, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to engage in spin, you can just read what it says and what is required.\xc2\xa0 And nobody has disputed that as a consequence of this agreement Iran has to drastically reduce its stockpiles of uranium, is cut off from plutonium; the Fordow facility that is underground is converted; that we have an unprecedented inspections regime; that we have snap-back provisions if they cheat.\xc2\xa0 The facts are the facts.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not concerned about what others say about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, with respect to Congress, my hope -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t prejudge this -- my hope is, is that everyone in Congress also evaluates this agreement based on the facts -- not on politics, not on posturing, not on the fact that this is a deal I bring to Congress as opposed to a Republican President, not based on lobbying, but based on what\xe2\x80\x99s in the national interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that if Congress does that, then, in fact, based on the facts, the majority of Congress should approve of this deal.\xc2\xa0 But we live in Washington and politics do intrude.\xc2\xa0 And as I said in an interview yesterday, I am not betting on the Republican Party rallying behind this agreement.\xc2\xa0 I do expect the debate to be based on facts and not speculation or misinformation.\xc2\xa0 And that I welcome -- in part because, look, there are legitimate real concerns here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already talked about it.\xc2\xa0 We have huge differences with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Israel has legitimate concerns about its security relative to Iran.\xc2\xa0 You have a large country with a significant military that has proclaimed that Israel shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, that has denied the Holocaust, that has financed Hezbollah, and as a consequence there are missiles that are pointed towards Tel Aviv.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think there are very good reasons why Israelis are nervous about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s position in the world generally.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it directly to the Israeli people.\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99ve also said is that all those threats are compounded if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And for all the objections of Prime Minister Netanyahu, or, for that matter, some of the Republican leadership that\xe2\x80\x99s already spoken, none of them have presented to me, or the American people, a better alternative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m hearing a lot of talking points being repeated about \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a bad deal\xe2\x80\x9d -- \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a historically bad deal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthis will threaten Israel and threaten the world and threaten the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is, what is your preferred alternative?\xc2\xa0 If 99 percent of the world community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say, this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, and you are arguing either that it does not, or that even if it does it\xe2\x80\x99s temporary, or that because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a windfall of their accounts being unfrozen that they\xe2\x80\x99ll cause more problems, then you should have some alternative to present.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is because there really are only two alternatives here:\xc2\xa0 Either the issue of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is resolved diplomatically through a negotiation, or it\xe2\x80\x99s resolved through force, through war.\xc2\xa0 Those are the options.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear some critics say, well, we could have negotiated a better deal.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 I think the suggestion among a lot of the critics has been that a better deal, an acceptable deal would be one in which Iran has no nuclear capacity at all, peaceful or otherwise.\xc2\xa0 The problem with that position is that there is nobody who thinks that Iran would or could ever accept that, and the international community does not take the view that Iran can\xe2\x80\x99t have a peaceful nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 They agree with us that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have diplomatic leverage to eliminate every vestige of a peaceful nuclear program in Iran.\xc2\xa0 What we do have the leverage to do is to make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo to go back to Congress, I challenge those who are objecting to this agreement, number one, to read the agreement before they comment on it; number two, to explain specifically where it is that they think this agreement does not prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and why they\xe2\x80\x99re right and people like Ernie Moniz, who is an MIT nuclear physicist and an expert in these issues, is wrong, why the rest of the world is wrong, and then present an alternative.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if the alternative is that we should bring Iran to heel through military force, then those critics should say so.\xc2\xa0 And that will be an honest debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, if I can --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu said that you have a situation where Iran can delay 24 days before giving access to military facilities --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a good example.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s take the issue of 24 days.\xc2\xa0 This has been I think swirling today, the notion that this is insufficient in terms of inspections.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, keep in mind, first of all, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have 24/7 inspections of declared nuclear facilities -- Fordow, Natanz, Arak, their uranium mines; facilities that are known to produce centrifuges, parts.\xc2\xa0 That entire infrastructure that we know about we will have sophisticated, 24/7 monitoring of those facilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo then the issue is, what if they try to develop a covert program?\xc2\xa0 Now, one of the advantages of having inspections across the entire production chain is that it makes it very difficult to set up a covert program.\xc2\xa0 There are only so many uranium mines in Iran.\xc2\xa0 And if, in fact, we\xe2\x80\x99re counting the amount of uranium that\xe2\x80\x99s being mined and suddenly some is missing on the back end, they got some explaining to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re able to track what\xe2\x80\x99s happening along the existing facilities to make sure that there is not diversion into a covert program.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s say that Iran is so determined that it now wants to operate covertly.\xc2\xa0 The IAEA, the international organization charged with implementing the non-proliferation treaty and monitoring nuclear activities in countries around the world -- the IAEA will have the ability to say, that undeclared site we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about, we see something suspicious.\xc2\xa0 And they will be able to say to Iran, we want to go inspect that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, if Iran objects, we can override it.\xc2\xa0 In the agreement, we\xe2\x80\x99ve set it up so we can override Iran\xe2\x80\x99s objection.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t need Russia or China in order for us to get that override.\xc2\xa0 And if they continue to object, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to snap back sanctions and declare that Iran is in violation and is cheating.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the fact that it may take 24 days to finally get access to the site, the nature of nuclear programs and facilities is such, this is not something you hide in a closet.\xc2\xa0 This is not something you put on a dolly and kind of wheel off somewhere.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, if we identify an undeclared site that we\xe2\x80\x99re suspicious about, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be keeping eyes on it.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be monitoring what the activity is, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be something that will be evidence if we think that some funny business was going on there that we can then present to the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll be monitoring that that entire time.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, if there is nuclear material on that site, high school physics will remind us that that leaves a trace.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll know that, in fact, there was a violation of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is, Jonathan, that this is the most vigorous inspection and verification regime by far that has ever been negotiated.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that Iran decides to try to cheat despite having this entire inspection verification mechanism?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 But if it does, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve built in a one-year breakout time, which gives us a year to respond forcefully.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve built in a snap-back provision so we don\'t have to go through lengthy negotiations at the U.N. to put the sanctions right back in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so really the only argument you can make against the verification and inspection mechanism that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward is that Iran is so intent on obtaining a nuclear weapon that no inspection regime and no verification mechanism would be sufficient because they\xe2\x80\x99d find some way to get around it because they\'re untrustworthy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if that\'s your view, then we go back to the choice that you have to make earlier.\xc2\xa0 That means, presumably, that you can\'t negotiate.\xc2\xa0 And what you\'re really saying is, is that you\'ve got to apply military force to guarantee that they don\'t have a nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And if somebody wants to make that debate -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Republican leadership, or Prime Minister Netanyahu, or the Israeli Ambassador or others, they\'re free to make it.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not persuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol Lee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about the arms and ballistic missile embargo.\xc2\xa0 Why did you decide -- agree to lift those even with the five- and eight-year durations?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously emerging as a sticking point on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned that arms to Iran will go to Hezbollah or Hamas?\xc2\xa0 And is there anything that you or a future President can do to stop that?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you don\'t mind, I wanted to see if you could step back a little bit, and when you look at this Iran deal and all the other issues and unrest that\'s happening in the Middle East, what kind of Middle East do you want to leave when you leave the White House in a year and a half?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 So the issue of the arms embargo and ballistic missiles is of real concern to us -- has been of real concern to us.\xc2\xa0 And it is in the national security interest of the United States to prevent Iran from sending weapons to Hezbollah, for example, or sending weapons to the Houthis in Yemen that accelerate a civil war there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a number of mechanisms under international law that give us authority to interdict arms shipments by Iran.\xc2\xa0 One of those mechanisms is the U.N. security resolution related to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Essentially, Iran was sanctioned because of what had happened at Fordow, its unwillingness to comply with previous U.N. security resolutions about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And as part of the package of sanctions that was slapped on them, the issue of arms and ballistic missiles were included.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, under the terms of the original U.N. resolution, the fact is that once an agreement was arrived at that gave the international community assurance Iran didn\'t have a nuclear weapon, you could argue just looking at the text that those arms and ballistic missile prohibitions should immediately go away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I said to our negotiators was given that Iran has breached trust, and the uncertainty of our allies in the region about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s activities, let\xe2\x80\x99s press for a longer extension of the arms embargo and the ballistic missile prohibitions.\xc2\xa0 And we got that.\xc2\xa0 We got five years in which, under this new agreement, arms coming in and out of Iran are prohibited.\xc2\xa0 And we got eight years with respect to ballistic missiles.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut part of the reason why we were willing to extend it only for five, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, as opposed to a longer period of time, is because we have other U.N. resolutions that prohibit arms sales by Iran to organizations like Hezbollah.\xc2\xa0 We have other U.N. resolutions and multilateral agreements that give us authority to interdict arms shipments from Iran throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve had belts and suspenders and buttons, a whole bunch of different legal authorities.\xc2\xa0 These legal authorities under the nuclear program may lapse after five or eight years, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll still be in possession of other legal authorities that allow us to interdict those arms.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd truthfully, these prohibitions are not self-enforcing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like the U.N. has the capacity to police what Iran is doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat it does is it gives us authority under international law to prevent arms shipments from happening in concert with our allies and our partners.\xc2\xa0 And the real problem, if you look at how, for example, Hezbollah got a lot of missiles that are a grave threat to Israel and many of our friends in the region, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because they were legal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not because somehow that was authorized under international law.\xc2\xa0 It was because there was insufficient intelligence, or capacity, to stop those shipments.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the bottom line is, Carol, I share the concerns of Israel, Saudis, Gulf partners about Iran shipping arms and causing conflict and chaos in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to them, let\xe2\x80\x99s double down and partner much more effectively to improve our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity so that fewer of those arms shipments are getting through the net.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the legal authorities, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still possess.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own unilateral prohibitions and sanctions in place around non-nuclear issues, like support for Hezbollah.\xc2\xa0 And those remain in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, in terms of the larger issues of the Middle East, obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a longer discussion.\xc2\xa0 I think my key goal when I turn over the keys to the President -- the next President -- is that we are on track to defeat ISIL; that they are much more contained and we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction there.\xc2\xa0 That we have jumpstarted a process to resolve the civil war in Syria, which is like an open sore in the region and is giving refuge to terrorist organizations who are taking advantage of that chaos.\xc2\xa0 To make sure that in Iraq not only have we pushed back ISIL, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve also created an environment in which Sunni, Shia and Kurd are starting to operate and function more effectively together.\xc2\xa0 And to be in a conversation with all our partners in the region about how we have strengthened our security partnerships so that they feel they can address any potential threats that may come, including threats from Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that includes providing additional security assurances and cooperation to Israel, building on the unprecedented cooperation that we have already put in place and support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already put in place.\xc2\xa0 It includes the work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with the GCC up at Camp David, making sure that we execute that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we\xe2\x80\x99ve done those things, then the problems in the Middle East will not be solved.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the job of the President of the United States to solve every problem in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 The people of the Middle East are going to have to solve some of these problems themselves.\xc2\xa0 But I think we can provide that next President at least a foundation for continued progress in these various areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I would say -- and this is a longer-term issue -- is we have to address the youth in the region with jobs and opportunity and a better vision for the future so that they are not tempted by the nihilistic, violent dead-end that organizations like ISIL offer.\xc2\xa0 Again, we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that entirely by ourselves, but we can partner with well-intentioned organizations, states, NGOs, religious leaders in the region.\xc2\xa0 We have to do a better job of that than we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing so far.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichael Crowley.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You alluded earlier to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s role in Syria, just to focus on that for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Many analysts and some former members of your administration believe that the kind of negotiated political settlement that you say is necessary in Syria will require working directly with Iran and giving Iran an important role.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree?\xc2\xa0 And is that a dialogue you\xe2\x80\x99ll be actively seeking?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what about the fight against ISIS?\xc2\xa0 What would it take for there to be explicit cooperation between the U.S. and Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I do agree that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to solve the problems in Syria unless there\xe2\x80\x99s buy-in from the Russians, the Iranians, the Turks, our Gulf partners.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too chaotic.\xc2\xa0 There are too many factions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s too much money and too many arms flooding into the zone.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten caught up in both sectarian conflict and geopolitical jockeying.\xc2\xa0 And in order for us to resolve it, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be agreement among the major powers that are interested in Syria that this is not going to be won on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 So Iran is one of those players, and I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for them to be part of that conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to repeat what I said earlier.\xc2\xa0 We have not -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any time in the near future -- restored normal diplomatic relations with Iran.\xc2\xa0 And so I do not foresee a formal set of agreements with Iran in terms of how we\xe2\x80\x99re conducting our counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut clearly, Iran has influence in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Iraq has a majority Shia population.\xc2\xa0 They have relationships to Iran.\xc2\xa0 Some are natural.\xc2\xa0 We expect somebody like Prime Minister Abadi to meet with and negotiate and work with Iran as its neighbor.\xc2\xa0 Some are less legitimate, where you see Iran financing Shia militias that in the past have killed American soldiers and in the future may carry out atrocities when they move into Sunni areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our diplomats on the ground, as well as our military teams on the ground to asses where can we appropriately at least de-conflict, and where can we work with Prime Minister Abadi around an overall strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty, and where do we tell Abadi, you know what, what Iran is doing there is a problem, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t cooperate in that area, for example, unless you get those folks out of there because we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have our troops, even in an advisory or training role, looking over their shoulders because they\xe2\x80\x99re not sure of what might happen to them.\xc2\xa0 And those conversations have been ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think they will continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one thing you can count on is that any work that the U.S. government does, or the U.S. military does in Iraq with other partners on the ground is premised on the idea that they are reporting to -- under the chain of command of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 If we don\xe2\x80\x99t have confidence that ultimately Abadi is directing those soldiers, then it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for us to have any kind of direct relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor Garrett.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 As you well know, there are four Americans in Iran -- three held on trumped-up charges, according to your administration; one, whereabouts unknown.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content, with all the fanfare around this deal, to leave the conscience of this nation and the strength of this nation unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, under no circumstances should there be any relief for Iran in terms of ballistic missiles or conventional weapons.\xc2\xa0 It is perceived that that was a last-minute capitulation in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Many in the Pentagon feel you\xe2\x80\x99ve left the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hung out to dry.\xc2\xa0 Could you comment?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I got to give you credit, Major, for how you craft those questions.\xc2\xa0 The notion that I am content as I celebrate with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails -- Major, that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, and you should know better.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve met with the families of some of those folks.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is content.\xc2\xa0 And our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, if the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates.\xc2\xa0 Suddenly, Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals.\xc2\xa0 It makes it much more difficult for us to walk away if Iran somehow thinks that a nuclear deal is dependent in some fashion on the nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, if we had walked away from the nuclear deal, we\xe2\x80\x99d still be pushing them just as hard to get these folks out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why those issues are not connected.\xc2\xa0 But we are working every single day to try to get them out, and won\xe2\x80\x99t stop until they\xe2\x80\x99re out and rejoined with their families.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, to some degree I already answered this with Carol.\xc2\xa0 We are not taking the pressure off Iran with respect to arms and with respect to ballistic missiles.\xc2\xa0 As I just explained, not only do we keep in place for five years the arms embargo under this particular new U.N. resolution, not only do we maintain the eight years on the ballistic missiles under this particular U.N. resolution, but we have a host of other multilateral and unilateral authorities that allow us to take action where we see Iran engaged in those activities whether it\xe2\x80\x99s six years from now or 10 years from now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have not lost those legal authorities.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, part of my pitch to the GCC countries, as well as to Prime Minister Netanyahu, is we should do a better job making sure that Iran is not engaged in sending arms to organizations like Hezbollah.\xc2\xa0 And as I just indicated, that means improving our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity with our partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril Ryan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I want to change the subject a bit.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this year, on the flight to Selma, you said, on matters of race, as President your job is to close the remaining gaps that are left in state and federal government.\xc2\xa0 Now, how does criminal justice reform fit into that equation?\xc2\xa0 And what gaps remain for you towards the end of your presidency?\xc2\xa0 And also, what does it mean to travel to Kenya, your father\xe2\x80\x99s homeland, in the next couple of weeks as President to the United States?\xc2\xa0 And lastly, would you revoke the Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You stuffed a lot in there, April.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I learned from my colleagues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Say, who did you learn from?\xc2\xa0 Jonathan Karl?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you said?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On criminal justice reform, obviously I gave a lengthy speech yesterday, but this is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about a lot; been working first with Eric Holder, now with Loretta Lynch about -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on along with other prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an outgrowth of the task force that we put together, post-Ferguson and the Garner case in New York.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the criminal justice system is obviously the sole source of racial tension in this country, or the key institution to resolving the opportunity gap.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is a part of the broader set of challenges that we face in creating a more perfect union.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the good news is, is that this is one of those rare issues where we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some Republican and Democratic interest, as well as federal, state, and local interest in solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 I think people recognize that there are violent criminals out there and they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be locked up.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have tough prosecutors, we have to support our law enforcement officials.\xc2\xa0 Police are in a tough job and they are helping to keep us safe, and we are grateful and thankful to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we also know is this huge spike in incarcerations is also driven by non-violent drug offenses where the sentencing is completely out of proportion with the crime.\xc2\xa0 And that costs taxpayers enormous amounts of money.\xc2\xa0 It is debilitating communities who are seeing huge proportions of the young men in their communities finding themselves with a criminal record, rendering them oftentimes unemployable.\xc2\xa0 So it compounds problems that these communities already have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I am very appreciative of folks like Dick Durbin and Cory Booker, alongside Mike Lee and Rand Paul and other folks in the House who are working together to see if we can both reduce some of these mandatory minimums around non-violent drug offenses.\xc2\xa0 Because again, I tend not to have a lot of sympathy when it comes to violent crime.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to non-violent drug offenses, is there work that we can do to reduce mandatory minimums, create more diversion programs like drug courts?\xc2\xa0 Then, can we do a better job on the rehabilitation side inside of prisons so that we are preparing these folks who are eventually going to be released to reenter the workforce?\xc2\xa0 On the back end, are we doing more to link them up with reentry programs that are effective?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this may be an area where we could have some really significant bipartisan legislation that doesn\'t eliminate all the other challenges we\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xc2\xa0 Because the most important goal is keeping folks from getting in the criminal justice system in the first place, which means early childhood education and good jobs, and making sure that we\'re not segregating folks in impoverished communities that have no contact with opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this can make a difference.\xc2\xa0 I met these four ex-offenders, as I said, yesterday, and what was remarkable was how they had turned their lives around.\xc2\xa0 And these were some folks who had been some pretty tough criminals.\xc2\xa0 One of them had served 10 years; another was a repeat offender that had served a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 And in each instance, somebody intervened at some point in their lives -- once they had already been in the criminal justice system, once they had already gotten in trouble -- and said, you know what, I think you can live a different way, and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to help you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that one person, an art teacher, or a GED teacher, or somebody who was willing to offer a guy a job -- I want to give a shout-out to Five Guys, because one of the guys there was an ex-felon, and Five Guys gave him a job.\xc2\xa0 And he ended up becoming a manager at the store and was able to completely turn his life around.\xc2\xa0 But the point was, somebody reached out to that person and gave him a chance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so part of our question should be, how about somebody reaching out to these guys when they\xe2\x80\x99re 10, or 11, or 12, or eight, as opposed to waiting until they\xe2\x80\x99ve already gone through a criminal justice program.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper.\xc2\xa0 But this is an area where I feel modestly optimistic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think in the meantime we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stay on top of keeping the crime rate down, because part of the reason I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation taking place is violent crime has significantly dropped.\xc2\xa0 Last year, we saw both incarcerations and the crime rate drop, and this can always turn if we start seeing renewed problems in terms of violent crime.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s parts of the country where violent crime is still a real problem, including my hometown of Chicago, and in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd part of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked Attorney General Lynch to do is to figure out how can we refocus attention.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do a package of criminal justice reforms, part of it would be actually having a greater police presence and more law enforcement in the communities that are really getting hit hard and haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen some of the drops in violent crime that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in places like Manhattan, for example.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the visit to Kenya, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as President because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference center.\xc2\xa0 And just the logistics of visiting a place are always tough as President, but it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously symbolically important.\xc2\xa0 And my hope is, is that we can deliver a message that the U.S. is a strong partner not just for Kenya, but for Sub-Saharan Africa generally; build on the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made around issues of health and education; focus on counterterrorism issues that are important in East Africa because of al-Shabaab and some of the tragedies that have happened inside of Kenya; and continue to encourage democracy and the reduction of corruption inside that country that sometimes has held back this incredibly gifted and blessed country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with respect to the Medal of Freedom, there\xe2\x80\x99s no precedent for revoking a medal.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have that mechanism.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, I tend to make it a policy not to comment on the specifics of cases where there might still be, if not criminal, then civil issues involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll say this:\xc2\xa0 If you give a woman -- or a man, for that matter -- without his or her knowledge, a drug, and then have sex with that person without consent, that\xe2\x80\x99s rape.\xc2\xa0 And I think this country -- any civilized country -- should have no tolerance for rape.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Have we exhausted Iran questions here?\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a helicopter that\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xc2\xa0 But I really am enjoying this Iran debate.\xc2\xa0 Topics that may not have been touched upon, criticisms that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that I did not answer?\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I know Josh is getting a little stressed here -- (laughter) -- but I just want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving any stones unturned here.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be brief.\xc2\xa0 The argument has been made that Iran now has a cash windfall, billions to spend.\xc2\xa0 Your people seem confident they\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend it at home.\xc2\xa0 Why are you confident they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to spend it on arming Hezbollah, arming Bashar al-Assad, et cetera?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you brought it up.\xc2\xa0 I think it is a mistake to characterize our belief that they will just spend it on daycare centers, and roads, and paying down debt.\xc2\xa0 We think that they have to do some of that, because Rouhani was elected specifically on the premise of improving the economic situation inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 That economy has tanked since we imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the notion that they\'re just immediately going to turn over $100 billion to the IRGC or the Quds Force I think runs contrary to all the intelligence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and the commitments that the Iranian government has made.</p>\n<p>\n\tDo we think that with the sanctions coming down, that Iran will have some additional resources for its military and for some of the activities in the region that are a threat to us and a threat to our allies?\xc2\xa0 I think that is a likelihood that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got some additional resources.\xc2\xa0 Do I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a game-changer for them?\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey are currently supporting Hezbollah, and there is a ceiling -- a pace at which they could support Hezbollah even more, particularly in the chaos that\'s taking place in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So can they potentially try to get more assistance there?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Should we put more resources into blocking them from getting that assistance to Hezbollah?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Is the incremental additional money that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to try to destabilize the region or send to their proxies, is that more important than preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- again, this is a matter of us making a determination of what is our priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other problem with the argument that folks have been making about, oh, this is a windfall and suddenly Iran is flushed with cash, and they\'re going to take over the world.\xc2\xa0 And I say that not tongue-in-cheek, because if you look at some of the statements by some of our critics, you would think that Iran is, in fact, going to take over the world as a consequence of this deal -- which I think would be news to the Iranians.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat argument is also premised on the notion that if there is no deal, if Congress votes down this deal, that we\'re able to keep sanctions in place with the same vigor and effectiveness as we have right now.\xc2\xa0 And that, I can promise you, is not true.\xc2\xa0 That is absolutely not true.\xc2\xa0 I want to repeat:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not writing Iran a check.\xc2\xa0 This is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s money that we were able to block from them having access to.\xc2\xa0 That required the cooperation of countries all around the world, many of whom really want to purchase oil from Iran.\xc2\xa0 The imposition of sanctions -- their cooperation with us -- has cost them billions of dollars, made it harder for them.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been willing to do that because they\xe2\x80\x99ve believed we were sincere about trying to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully, and they considered that a priority -- a high enough priority that they were willing to cooperate with us on sanctions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf they saw us walking away, or more specifically, if they saw the U.S. Congress effectively vetoing the judgment of 99 percent of the world community that this is a deal that resolves the Iranian weapons program -- nuclear weapons program in an equitable way, the sanctions system unravels.\xc2\xa0 And so we could still maintain some of our unilateral sanctions, but it would be far less effective -- as it was before we were able to put together these multilateral sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo maybe they don\'t get $100 billion; maybe they get $60 billion or $70 billion instead.\xc2\xa0 The price for that that we\xe2\x80\x99ve paid is that now Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 We have no inspectors on the ground.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re still getting some cash windfall.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve lost credibility in the eyes of the world.\xc2\xa0 We will have effectively united Iran and divided ourselves from our allies.\xc2\xa0 A terrible position to be in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m just going to look -- I made some notes about any of the arguments -- the other arguments that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about -- (off-mic) -- the end of the deal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Okay, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good one.\xc2\xa0 The notion --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the end of the deal they could go back --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, so let\xe2\x80\x99s address this issue of -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s the other big argument that\xe2\x80\x99s been made.\xc2\xa0 All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that the deal holds for 10 years, Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cheat.\xc2\xa0 Now, at the end of 10 years, some of the restrictions have been lifted -- although, remember, others stay in place for 15 years.\xc2\xa0 So for example, they\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to keep their stockpiles at a minimal level for 15 years.\xc2\xa0 The inspections don\xe2\x80\x99t go away; those are still in place 15, 20 years from now.\xc2\xa0 Their commitment under the Non-Proliferation Treaty does not go away; that\xe2\x80\x99s still in place.\xc2\xa0 The additional protocol that they have to sign up for under this deal, which requires a more extensive inspection and verification mechanism -- that stays in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no scenario in which a U.S. President is not in a stronger position 12, 13, 15 years from now if, in fact, Iran decided at that point they still wanted to get a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind, we will have maintained a one-year breakout time, we will have rolled back their program, frozen their facilities, kept them under severe restrictions, had observers.\xc2\xa0 They will have made international commitments supported by countries around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd -- hold on a second -- and if at that point they finally decided, you know what, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to cheat, or not even cheat -- at that point, they decide openly we\xe2\x80\x99re now pursuing a nuclear weapon -- they\xe2\x80\x99re still in violation of this deal and the commitments they\xe2\x80\x99ve made internationally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are still in a position to mobilize the world community to say, no, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re not in a stronger position to get a nuclear weapon at that point; they\xe2\x80\x99re in a weaker position than they are today.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t given away any of our military capabilities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not in a weaker position to respond.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even if everything the critics were saying was true -- that at the end of 10 years, or 12 years, or 15 years, Iran now is in a position to decide it wants a nuclear weapon, that they\xe2\x80\x99re at a breakout point -- they won\xe2\x80\x99t be at a breakout point that is more dangerous than the breakout point they\xe2\x80\x99re in right now.\xc2\xa0 They won\xe2\x80\x99t be at a breakout point that is shorter than the one that exists today.\xc2\xa0 And so why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we at least make sure that for the next 10, 15, years they are not getting a nuclear weapon and we can verify it; and afterwards, if they decide if they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed their mind, we are then much more knowledgeable about what their capabilities are, much more knowledgeable about what their program is, and still in a position to take whatever actions we would take today?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So none of this is holding out hope that they\xe2\x80\x99ll change their behavior?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing different --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'m always hopeful that behavior may change for the sake of the Iranian people as well as people in the region.\xc2\xa0 There are young people there who are not getting the opportunities they deserve because of conflict, because of sectarianism, because of poor governance, because of repression, because of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And I remain eternally hopeful that we can do something about that, and it should be part of U.S. foreign policy to do something about that.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not banking on that to say that this deal is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, it is incumbent on the critics of this deal to explain how an American President is in a worse position 12, 13, 14, 15 years from now if, in fact, at that point Iran says we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pull out of the NPT, kick out inspectors and go for a nuclear bomb.\xc2\xa0 If that happens, that President will be in a better position than what happened if Iran, as a consequence of Congress rejecting this deal, decides that\xe2\x80\x99s it, we\xe2\x80\x99re done negotiating, we\xe2\x80\x99re going after a bomb right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe choices would be tougher today than they would be for that President 15 years from now.\xc2\xa0 And I have not yet heard logic that refutes that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 I really have to go now.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve hit the big themes.\xc2\xa0 But I promise you, I will address this again.\xc2\xa0 All right?\xc2\xa0 I suspect this is not the last that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of this debate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:33 P.M.
