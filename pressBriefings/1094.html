CDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s start.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful day in Iowa and this is your gaggle.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to our better digs.\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 Wondering if you could comment on the remarks that Governor Perry made yesterday regarding Fed Chairman.\xc2\xa0 And two, if -- now that we\xe2\x80\x99re a day and a half into this, if you could kind of contemplate a little bit on what the President is accomplishing in this trip, and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s changing any kind of storyline that he has been facing over the past several weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first, I guess the only comment I have is that when you\xe2\x80\x99re President or you\xe2\x80\x99re running for President you have to think about what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, because your words have greater impact.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama and we take the independence of the Federal Reserve quite seriously, and certainly think threatening the Fed Chairman is probably not a good idea. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the trip, I think the purpose of the trip is for the President of the United States to get out into the country and to interact with folks here in these three states -- Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois -- talk about the economy, talk about what -- listen to people here, find out what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing and seeing about the economy, and how -- hear their ideas for things that are working, especially among small business men and women.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, he just had breakfast with some small businessmen.\xc2\xa0 And he actually -- I just found out when we got in the van that he invited them to come to the Rural Forum, and they\xe2\x80\x99re coming; most of them are going to try to come.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is principally a trip focused on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The rural economy is a vital part of the overall American economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a vital part of the engine that small business represents in the American in terms of economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying this trip tremendously and thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s very important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Incredible amounts of downtime.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President doing during those long rides?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, as you know, as is true, wherever he travels, he\xe2\x80\x99s got full communications capabilities, and he has the need to and the capability to stay in contact with senior advisors who are not traveling with him and others, obviously, in the administration.\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99s doing that, getting updates, and staying in touch with folks.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific phone calls to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But if we do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During your last gaggle you said that one of the reasons he was coming to this state was because unemployment was slightly lower here, and he could try to find one of the things they\xe2\x80\x99re learning about the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was asked about why he was -- why come here when unemployment is lower here than the average in the nation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- first of all, he\xe2\x80\x99s traveled throughout the country into areas where unemployment is either below average or above average.\xc2\xa0 He was in Michigan last week, for example.\xc2\xa0 And I think one of the things that you can find in places that are doing comparatively well is what\xe2\x80\x99s working.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he looks forward to hearing from local businessmen and women here in this part of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he learned what\xe2\x80\x99s working here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him speak for himself.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be speaking a number of times at the Rural Forum that we\xe2\x80\x99re having, in just a short amount of time.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably address that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you said that threatening the Fed Chairman is not a good idea, what kind of threat do you think that Rick Perry was making?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just -- that was -- those were my words.\xc2\xa0 I just mean -- I just think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be careful of what you say.\xc2\xa0 The Fed\xe2\x80\x99s independence is important, and that\xe2\x80\x99s really the only thing I was trying to convey.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President made a few comments about Republican candidates yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect him in the coming months to engage more directly, even while he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on -- not focused on the campaign to engage more directly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the -- those comments were in the context of discussing the challenges that face policymakers and elected officials in Washington, that have faced them all year and will continue to face them this fall, involving, in this case, the need to get our deficits and debt further under control, to take dramatic action -- the kind of action that will only work if it\xe2\x80\x99s done in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And he was struck by the fact that -- the sort of maximalist position that was taken by those who would lead their party, and that he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s representative of an unwillingness to compromise that is precisely what\xe2\x80\x99s causing the kind of political gridlock in Washington that Americans get so frustrated by.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you have more leverage in the September, October, November negotiations because the debt limit is no longer, to quote, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing held hostage\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago, but all of our memories get fuzzy pretty quickly -- that the President put an extraordinary amount of effort into trying to reach a grand compromise, grand bargain with the Speaker of the House that would really fix this problem for the long term. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the Speaker walked away from the table and the prospects of getting that grand bargain were diminished, at least for now, the issue that remained was, would the Republicans -- would the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 insistence that we go through the circus of holding our economy and our ability to pay our obligations hostage to a political agenda, and doing that again in the next few months -- would that prevail?\xc2\xa0 Or would the President\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that doing that kind of harm to our economy by creating that kind of uncertainty was unacceptable -- would that position prevail?\xc2\xa0 And in the end, as you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position prevailed, and precisely because our lawmakers and -- we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing things in Washington to hurt the economy; we should be focused on doing things to help the economy.\xc2\xa0 And he was very focused on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a long way of getting to your question that having removed that threat that would have otherwise been there, the President does feel that we can now debate these issues about how best to deal with our deficits and debt, and we can debate issues about how best to promote economic growth and spur job creation without having that hanging over us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the White House coordinate at all with Warren Buffett?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we obviously -- the President has made reference to Mr. Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s article, and others have -- we endorse his point of view.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any coordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 Firstly, any reaction to Fitch affirming the U.S. AAA credit rating?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, on the Washington Post housing story, any comment on the administration pulling together a team to look at GSE reform?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the Fitch, obviously I would refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 But we believe strongly -- the Treasury Department, the administration -- that America\xe2\x80\x99s credit rating is and remains AAA, but that overall this is just another reminder of why we need to continue to take steps to address our deficit and long-term debt issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me get this next one right here.\xc2\xa0 On the article you referred to, I just want to say that it is simply untrue that the administration has settled on any single proposal for the longer-term structure of the housing finance market. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Housing Finance Reform team at the White House, the Treasury Department, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development continues to weigh and analyze each of the options laid out in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s report to Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The article in question mischaracterizes a number of the core housing finance reform principles that the administration laid out in its February report to Congress.\xc2\xa0 The administration believes that the private sector, subject to strong oversight and consumer protection, should be the dominant provider of mortgage credit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why in each of the three options we outlined in our report to Congress, the government\xe2\x80\x99s footprint in the housing market will shrink substantially.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why in each of the options, any government support for housing finance will be targeted and limited.\xc2\xa0 That will ensure that taxpayers are protected and the private sector bears the burden for losses.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you email that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I can -- I think the Treasury might be coming out with something soon on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that -- that\xe2\x80\x99s your statement, or were you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s provided by Treasury, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night the President made reference to a package that he is going to submit to Congress when they come back in September.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in that?\xc2\xa0 How fully formed is it?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be the items that he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about on this trip, something different?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some guidance on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go any further than what the President has said, not just yesterday but in previous remarks.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that -- both yesterday and previously -- that he will put his concrete ideas for further deficit reduction on the table, provide them to the select -- joint select special committee -- super committee of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He will also -- has been talking a lot about some of his ideas that he believes could get bipartisan support for further economic growth and to spur economic growth and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will have some new ideas as well beyond those that he\xe2\x80\x99s discussed, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into any more specifics than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be a legislative package that he offers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the process of how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be rolled out.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it at what the President said yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After what the President said yesterday, he seemed to sort of lay out almost a campaign strategy for what would happen if that plan failed in Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he simply said that we have as our highest priority taking steps to help the economy grow and to create jobs, and he would put forward ideas that should have -- have in the past and should have broad support and that are backed by the views of economists broadly on what would help the economy, speaking specifically on growth and job creation, and that he would expect Congress to work with him to make that happen because growing the economy and creating jobs is or should be their highest priority.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to achieve some of those goals, then we would have to take the argument to the American people about what the best measures are to help the economy grow and to create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He specifically said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be running against a Congress that will not move to help the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So is this -- I mean, is it a campaign --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is separate from what he said about laying out his ideas in September, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will be laying out an idea plan in September and my message to Congress will be, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be running -- then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be running against the Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what I just said:\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, he will take his arguments to the American people, because there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous, broad, bipartisan support for the kinds of ideas that the President has put forward, both to achieve significant deficit and debt reduction and to spur economic growth and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 A perfect example is the payroll tax cut that he pushed through and got Congress to agree to last December for one year that he wants to extend next year -- puts money in the pockets of every working American, helps them make ends meet, and that, in turn, puts money back into the economy and helps the economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a tax cut for most or all working Americans; you would think that it would be something that the Republicans would support, and he expects that they will, even though we have heard otherwise on occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this will not be a campaign --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not campaigning.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- this is August of 2011.\xc2\xa0 This is a proposal to get Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the ideas that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward already, the ideas that are under consideration are all that have in the past had broad support, bipartisan support, certainly should have broad, bipartisan support in the present and the future, and we expect that if Congress is serious about helping the economy grow and create jobs, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get support when the President puts them forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how do you persuade this Congress to do something like invest in infrastructure and spend money on the kinds of stuff the President is talking about when they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown an unwillingness to do anything on the revenue side?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not an esoteric argument, it\xe2\x80\x99s about saving jobs and creating jobs; it\xe2\x80\x99s about investing in the infrastructure of our country.\xc2\xa0 And, again, if you look at investments in infrastructure, they have historically had broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 The infrastructure bank is something that the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO support, so I would expect that members of Congress would hear from some of their traditional allies -- in this case, business -- on why that kind of investment is essential to help create jobs, help the economy grow, and help rebuild the foundation of our economy so that it can grow and create jobs into the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think those are the kinds of proposals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to talk about, and we expect that there will be a fair amount of pressure on Congress to do things to create jobs as opposed to -- going back to the Warren Buffett editorial that was mentioned earlier -- as opposed to extending or adding tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires who pay lower rates in taxes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that taxes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- than their secretaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- proposing to raise taxes on the top earners?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that at all.\xc2\xa0 Well, you know the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on that.\xc2\xa0 And, again, as part of any broad and successful effort to reduce our deficits and long-term debt, he would absolutely support revenues being part of that package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that Warren Buffett was at the White House a couple weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Has he ever offered to provide support to the President as an economic surrogate to validate administration policies or messages on the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think Mr. Buffett is an independent person who speaks his mind, as I think he has for a long time now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To your previous answer, one of the things that the last eight months have proved is that leverage works incredibly well in negotiations, particularly for the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s leverage going forward with your -- with the economic plan he wants to put out in September?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the Republicans used the extension of the Bush tax cuts as leverage in December; they used the debt ceiling as leverage in this go-around.\xc2\xa0 What does the President have?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would take issue with your second point, because I think that the principal objective that the Republican Party had through the debt ceiling negotiations was to ensure that we went through a second round -- a second vote on raising the debt ceilings, at which point they could, having agreed to a first round of discretionary cuts, they could try to force the President and others in Congress to accept draconian cuts in entitlement programs that were wildly and widely unacceptable to the American public, to the President, and to -- certainly to Democrats in Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was their objective, and they failed.\xc2\xa0 So the leverage that they thought they had they did not have.\xc2\xa0 And, principally, that\xe2\x80\x99s because the American people were not at all behind them in that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of going forward, I think, again, that goes back to where the public is and what the public wants to see, and the kind of -- what I imagine a lot of members of Congress of both parties are hearing as they spend August away from Washington and hopefully listening to their constituents and their expectation that Washington will do things that will help the private sector create jobs; will do things to help them make their ends meet at home; and will do things to get the deficit under control in a way that represents the kind of compromise that is required for anything big to get done.\xc2\xa0 It has always been the case.\xc2\xa0 And it has to be the case if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get anything big done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the payroll tax cut, as an example, be the kind of leverage that the President would have?\xc2\xa0 Because without extending that, it would be tantamount to a tax increase on the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that he can parlay into getting some action from Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The idea that if you fail to extend it, it would be a tax increase?\xc2\xa0 Is that how you would write it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it was not extended, well, it would certainly be an additional burden on the middle class.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good point.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that the facts here are our friends and that that would be a fact.\xc2\xa0 And that at a time that we\xe2\x80\x99re still emerging from the worst --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that (inaudible) -- other than how I would write it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, because we expect in the end to see bipartisan support for that proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously called for extending UI and the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 But I have a question about the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall diagnosis of the economic problem.\xc2\xa0 Are those and a number of other somewhat modest measures like the veterans program perhaps important, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not a huge stimulus program -- are those enough or does the President see economically the need so big that government needs to have a major new initiative to fill the gap? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get beyond where the President has been and what he said yesterday, and what -- or into --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think since it\xe2\x80\x99s his job to propose solutions to problems, I think that analyzing the size of the problem that needs a solution would be a back way -- a back end way of answering that other question.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very clear about where we are economically, how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, how many private sector jobs we\xe2\x80\x99ve created, and very clear and candid about where we are right now as the economy has -- economic growth has slowed and job creation has slowed in part because of some of the headwinds that we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced this year that were unanticipated, the Arab Spring that\xe2\x80\x99s caused a surge in oil prices, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that had a significant impact on global supply chains and the situation in Europe.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve fought through those and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to.\xc2\xa0 And we think we just need to continue to take measures that will help the economy grow and create jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say if corporate tax repatriation holiday is one of the things that you\xe2\x80\x99re considering?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a guessing game about which proposals we may or may not be considering.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to him to propose.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we\xe2\x80\x99re passing Dyersville, home of \xe2\x80\x9cField of Dreams\xe2\x80\x9d --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wish we could stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chicago White Sox. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll do an OTR.\xc2\xa0 That would be fun.\xc2\xa0 Perfect day for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was off the record?\xc2\xa0 That was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll do an OTR.\xc2\xa0 That can be on the record.\xc2\xa0 Anybody else? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that some of the ideas that the President was talking about today might translate to jobs in the rural communities that we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting -- he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot about that, some of the proposals that we unveiled this morning.\xc2\xa0 We have the Small Business Administration Administrator here and a number of other representatives from the Cabinet promoting some of these initiatives.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack has spoken a lot about this.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn more from the experts shortly on the direct impact we expect those initiatives to have on the rural economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other small point -- the President has called for patent reform and passage of the trade bills.\xc2\xa0 And Republicans in Congress are saying we\xe2\x80\x99re planning a vote on patent reform as soon as Congress comes back, and the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t submitted the trade bills, so why does he keep calling for these two items if they\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re glad that the Congress will vote on the patent reform and hope they will.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling for it for quite a while and hope they finally will vote on it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign.\xc2\xa0 That will be a helpful thing if that takes place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the trade bills, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that we need to take action and we need to get an agreement with Congress on the submission process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress in our dealings with the Senate leaders, and hope and expect that that will -- process will be resolved and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get this done, because we definitely agree that passing those trade bills and making sure we have a process that allows for the TFAs [sic] and the TAA to go forward will be very beneficial to the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is basically a sequencing issue, Jay, getting the TAA passed first and then getting the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- how the process itself works, I might steer you to Treasury on that.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s working out an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working out an agreement with Congress for submission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because McConnell and Reid do have an agreement (inaudible). Is the issue right now working something out --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific on it.\xc2\xa0 But we do -- we are pleased by the progress made in the Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about -- to change the topic a little bit, did you have any reaction to the news yesterday that Pakistan might have shown our helicopter to China after the Osama bin Laden raid?\xc2\xa0 And does that change our relationship with Pakistan at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 If you want to come back to me, I can get you something for it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you do something on it, can you share?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We understand that these are new -- sort of a new addition to the Secret Service arsenal --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s the expert on that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Not much armor --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the Secret Service for the specifics about the bus.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports and overheard information that it has like a PA system on board.\xc2\xa0 The President might be using that at stops like that.\xc2\xa0 Do we have any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about all of its capabilities.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the bus, used the PA system.\xc2\xa0 He has -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some pictures of him waving from the front of the bus to folks lining the roads.\xc2\xa0 But other things that it\xe2\x80\x99s capable of, I point you to the Secret Service for answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Communications capability (inaudible) stay in touch with -- more than what he\xe2\x80\x99s had --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s comparable to what he\xe2\x80\x99s had.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously when he is in the presidential limo and on Air Force One -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s an essential element of presidential travel.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 But I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that they\xe2\x80\x99ve said that one of the reasons why they feel like they\xe2\x80\x99ve long needed this kind of bus in their fleet is because they\xe2\x80\x99ve -- for a number of decades now, Presidents, Vice Presidents, presidential candidates have traveled by bus.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very useful and cost-effective, because in the past they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to lease buses at great expense, retrofit them -- or outfit them to have all this security that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary and then reverse that process at great expense, so that this, in this view -- and, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just citing them and their view, was a cost-effective approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 11:27 A.M.
