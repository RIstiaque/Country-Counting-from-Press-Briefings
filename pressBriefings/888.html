EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll do a brief gaggle.\xc2\xa0 We were waiting because the President just got off the phone with Wilma Parsons, who is the daughter of Ann Harris -- Josephine Ann Harris -- who was the owner of Ann\'s Restaurant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think you all saw the report, the very sad news that Ann passed away this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And you know the President met with her at the restaurant -- she actually wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there when he arrived, but she came with some other members of her family, and he met with her I think after the pool had left.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President expressed his sorrow and his condolences at the very sad event.\xc2\xa0 He was honored to meet her this morning and passed on his feelings that the whole family is in his thoughts and prayers today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And also there\'s a statement that\'s going out as we speak from the Ohio campaign, from their state director, Greg Schultz.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just going to read it here:</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re extremely saddened by Ann\'s sudden passing this morning.\xc2\xa0 Our sincere condolences go to Ann\'s family during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a small business owner, a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother, and a friend of many throughout the community, Ann led an exceptional life and will be missed by all who knew her.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn and her family are in our thoughts and prayers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that the President was in danger of having been food-poisoned or anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, somebody dies in a restaurant where the President was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even in the restaurant.\xc2\xa0 She met with him outside -- she drove up to the restaurant.\xc2\xa0 But, no, there was never -- I mean, obviously you can address questions about the President\'s security to the Secret Service, but, no, that was not a concern here.\xc2\xa0 Based on the press reports, I believe it was a heart attack.\xc2\xa0 She was -- my understanding is that she had not been well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Schultz.\xc2\xa0 The Columbus Dispatch this morning reported that he was resigning as the county Democratic chairman amid some investigation into the county party\'s finances.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to his role in the campaign to this point?\xc2\xa0 Does the President still have confidence in him as the Ohio state director?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and he\'s the state director in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll defer questions about the specific situation to the Ohio campaign.\xc2\xa0 I\'d be happy to get you a contact there and they can lay out any more specifics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about the situation that he -- involving Mr. Schultz and the finances that are being investigated?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I have not discussed it with the President.\xc2\xa0 But again, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 We can get you additional background.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re at all running out of time with the message that "we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long way to go, things are getting better, but hang in there, we can all do this together"?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You heard the President talk over the last two days, not just about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long way to go and we\xe2\x80\x99re digging ourselves out of a hole, which is true.\xc2\xa0 We know we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction, and the jobs -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen positive signs in the jobs numbers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most important piece of what he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about over the last couple of days is the competing visions for the future of the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people care about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what people have been asking him about on the campaign trail -- what he represents that\'s different from Mitt Romney; what he will do for them to help them get access to health care, help them get access to education, help them get the tax cuts and tax breaks and jobs that they need.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is and what he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about out on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Podesta today said it was a sideways jobs report is that the President should be very concerned.\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned? And do you consider it a sideways kind of movement -- the 8.2 percent is still there -- still the unemployment rate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President today, as he has repeatedly in the past, made clear that we are nowhere near where we want to be and need to be economically.\xc2\xa0 We have in the past, since the recession ended, created 4.4 million private sector jobs, and that stands in stark contrast to a situation where the recession was in full bloom when the President took office, ended up costing the country nearly 9 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 But there is still a long way to go, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is so focused on the policies that he believes are essential to continuing the economic growth, continuing the job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I\'ve said repeatedly, the President would sign tomorrow the remaining elements of the American Jobs Act that, by the estimates of independent economists, would put up to a million Americans back to work.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress have refused to pass that legislation and the Republican leaders oppose it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know what we need to do in order to get this economy continuing in the right direction, and the President speaks about it all the time, as he did today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing to hear from Mitt Romney just more about the failed policies of the past and his repackaging of those and pushing them forward as a solution.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t take it from us -- private sector economists have said that his plans will do nothing to help the short-term growth and put people back to work in the short term.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard from him a lot of angry rhetoric about the campaign and really a lack of solutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:54 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
