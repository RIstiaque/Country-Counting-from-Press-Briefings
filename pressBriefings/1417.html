BURTON:\xc2\xa0 So, for starters, let me tell you a little bit about Florida.\xc2\xa0 Upon arrival, Governor Crist, Mayors Dyer and Iorio and Senator Bill Nelson and Alex Sink will all meet us.\xc2\xa0 The President will visit a hangar where crewmembers are doing work on a KC-135 Stratotanker.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a plane that\'s used to refill other planes that are in the air that have been flying missions to and from Haiti.</p>\n<p>After that we\'ll go to the town hall.\xc2\xa0 That event will have about 3,000 people.\xc2\xa0 The tickets were handed out by the White House and by the university.\xc2\xa0 It was free and open to the public.\xc2\xa0 There\'s also some groups in the area who received some of the tickets.</p>\n<p>On Air Force One right now are Congresswomen Castor and Wasserman-Schultz and Congressmen Grayson and Meek.\xc2\xa0 And just wanted to let you know that tomorrow the President will travel to Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 As you know he\'s speaking to the Republican House Caucus, where he\'ll hit on some of the things that he talked about in the State of the Union, but he\'ll also visit a small business and lay out a program, the details of which will be described in a conference call this afternoon later today.\xc2\xa0 And the conference call, we\'ll work with the schedule of the folks who are traveling on this trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any details about the program at all?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Nope.\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the meeting with Republicans -- how is that going to be covered?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be pool?\xc2\xa0 Is it closed press?\xc2\xa0 What is it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a hundred percent sure.\xc2\xa0 So I will let you know when we hit the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, Mayor Bloomberg in New York has expressed concern, in fact, reversed his position, on having the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Lower Manhattan.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House reconsidering this?\xc2\xa0 And is the White House given any pause given the change of support in New York for this?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is a murderous thug who has admitted to crimes -- who has admitted to some of the most heinous crimes ever committed against our country.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to seeing that he\'s brought to justice.</p>\n<p>Now, he agrees with the Attorney General\'s opinion that -- in November -- that he and others can be litigated successfully and securely in the United States of America, just like others have, like Richard Reid.\xc2\xa0 Currently our federal jails hold hundreds of convicted terrorists, and the President\'s opinion has not changed on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to the mayor about this, or has the mayor reached out to the White House?\xc2\xa0 And is the President open to advising his Attorney General to change policy?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the specifics of the trial and prosecutors and location, I would refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, a couple of State of the Union questions.\xc2\xa0 The President made a clear call to reach out to Republicans; some of the reaction back has not been so friendly.\xc2\xa0 Leader Boehner said that the President offered more "job-killing policies."\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- what\'s his reaction to the reaction he\'s getting?\xc2\xa0 And does he think Republicans genuinely want to work with him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s view is that his door is open.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans have ideas, if they\'ve got thoughts on how they think that we can create jobs, how we can get this economy moving, how we can reform health care, he\'s open to that.</p>\n<p>Now, I think the President also believes that what the American people sent him and members of Congress to do was to work together in order to take on some of these big challenges and actually make progress on these important issues.</p>\n<p>So nobody thought that change was going to happen overnight, or that one speech or that one year in the presidency was going to melt away all the partisanship and gridlock in Washington. But we\'re chipping away at it piece by piece, and the President is committed to making progress because that\'s what the American people expect him to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, how are we supposed to read into the length of time it took the President to get to health care last night?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Nothing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President -- in the speech last night, what the President did was lay out some of the serious challenges that face our nation, some of his top priorities.\xc2\xa0 And that means creating jobs, getting the economy going again, but also reforming health care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, there\'s been a lot of talk about who\'s up, who\'s down, what\'s in, what\'s out, as a result of what folks on Capitol Hill are saying or what happened in the special election in Massachusetts, but none of the reasons that the President took on health care -- the rising costs, the insurance reforms that so desperately need to be done -- changed just because of that election or what folks are saying.</p>\n<p>So the President remains committed to making progress on health care reform, and I wouldn\'t over-read its placement in the speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House response to Iran\'s execution of these two people linked to the pro-democracy protest?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that the U.S. strongly condemns these unjust executions.\xc2\xa0 We see it as a low point in the Islamic Republic\'s unjust and ruthless crackdown of peaceful dissent.\xc2\xa0 Murdering political prisoners who are exercising their universal rights will not bring the respect and legitimacy the Islamic Republic seeks.\xc2\xa0 It will only serve to further isolate Iran\'s government in the world and from its people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President support requiring shareholder approval before a company could spend money on ads, like in reference to the Supreme Court decision?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There are a series of reforms that the President is looking at and talking to members of Congress about.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into the specifics of the negotiations and what those are, but campaign finance reform has become a lot more important in the course of the last couple of weeks and the President and his team are focused on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the President\'s reaction to Justice Alito\'s reaction to his speech?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, this issue is something that many have serious concerns about.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that Justice Ginsburg brought up in her oral arguments.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that Justice Stevens wrote about in his dissent.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an issue that the Court could have specifically addressed in its findings, but they didn\'t.\xc2\xa0 And the American people deserve the right to know that foreign corporations cannot interfere with American elections.</p>\n<p>So this is another one of the issues that the President is looking at in terms of campaign finance reform.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the specific reaction to Justice Alito, one of the great things about our democracy is that powerful members of the government at high levels can disagree in public and in private.\xc2\xa0 This is one of those cases.\xc2\xa0 But the President is no less committed to seeing this reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, on jobs, he called for getting a jobs bill to his desk very quickly.\xc2\xa0 What\'s going on in the Senate, and what role is the White House playing in getting that jobs bill done in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President made pretty clear last night that this was a high priority for him.\xc2\xa0 So you can bet that Phil Schiliro and Shawn Maher and his team of folks are working very hard to get some of his ideas that he laid out in his December Brookings speech into that Senate bill.</p>\n<p>Nobody thinks that we\'re necessarily going to get every single good idea that the President has into one bill, and we\'ll continue to work with the Senate and the House in coming weeks in order to get more measures through, like on small businesses, that the President laid out, and other things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the fact that there was very little mentioned in the speech last night about national security and foreign policy?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know that there was some, but there\'s also some criticism that it just wasn\'t enough.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, when I woke up this morning, I opened up the papers and I saw some people said that some things weren\'t talked about enough, some things were talked about too much, the speech was too long, the speech was this in comparison to that.\xc2\xa0 I just think that different folks have different opinions of what should be in and what should be out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It should be obvious to everyone who observes the President that national security is critically important to him.\xc2\xa0 He wakes up every morning wondering what he can do to keep the American people safe, what we can do to improve our systems of securing Americans here at home and all around the world.\xc2\xa0 He laid out some very specific issues in terms of Iran.\xc2\xa0 He talked about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He talked about some of the global threats that we face.</p>\n<p>So he laid out what he thought was appropriate to talk about and continues to work on the issues that he thinks are important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, what was the White House\'s thinking about not getting more prescriptive on the issue of health care?\xc2\xa0 He challenged the Congress to get the job done, but didn\'t get specific about how he wants it to get done.\xc2\xa0 What was the White House thinking behind going that route?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has done is laid out his principles, what he thinks is the best way forward in terms of getting costs under control, in terms of getting insurance reforms in place.\xc2\xa0 And his team of folks is working with the House and the Senate in order to find the best path forward, and those talks continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about how high-speed rail will compare to, like, Northeast Corridor, just the regular rail?\xc2\xa0 How much time will it save passengers?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any data on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specific data on the time that it saves, necessarily.\xc2\xa0 But just as a little preview of what the Vice President will be talking about a little bit today when he introduces the President:\xc2\xa0 This is an $8 billion program to states for a nationwide high-speed inner-city rail system.\xc2\xa0 The program creates tens of thousands of jobs and is the largest investment in infrastructure since the Interstate Highway System was created.</p>\n<p>In short, it\'ll create jobs, it\'ll use cleaner energy, it will help to stop the need to widen highways, like the I-4 and others all over the country, and it will get people where they want to go faster.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why the joint appearance with the Vice President?\xc2\xa0 Bringing out the big guns for a light-rail announcement?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the thinking?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is a huge program.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to create tens of thousands of jobs.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the Vice President has been tasked with making sure that the Recovery Act is working smoothly and creating the jobs that it needs to create, helping the economy the way that it needs to.\xc2\xa0 So this is a big announcement, and so the President and the Vice President decided to come out and do it together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama planning on hugging Charlie Crist?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to him about the specific greeting, but we look forward to seeing all the Florida officials who will be there when we get on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we know what the delay was in leaving this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It just is one of those deals where Rahm wanted to speak to the President and everything sort of slowed down a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Rahm get fired?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is awkward, but, yes, I\'m announcing right now that -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n11:46 A.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
