Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:50 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Always fun to cover a little history, right?\xc2\xa0 This has made plenty of news today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have anything to add to it at this point.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions on the Supreme Court nomination or any other topics that you may have at the top of your list today.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Kevin, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Josh, can you say when the President decided on Judge Garland as his choice?\xc2\xa0 And did Judge Garland hesitate to put himself through this process knowing that the Republicans have said they\xe2\x80\x99re simply going to wait until next year to pick up this vacancy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President has been hard at work in making the decision about the best person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, the President and his team consulted a wide array of individuals and organizations on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 Every Senate office was contacted by the White House to consult about potential nominees.\xc2\xa0 The President had multiple conversations with Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee about this decision.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s only recently that the President made a final decision on this.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly reflected a lot of work and extensive consultation among legal experts and members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to Chief Judge Garland, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any reticence on his part to accept this significant responsibility.\xc2\xa0 It certainly -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody detected any reticence about that based on the public comments that he delivered this morning in the Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you seeing any signs of a breakthrough with the Republicans that they will at least consider a confirmation hearing?\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there is a constitutional responsibility that members of the United States Senate have to consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that.\xc2\xa0 And this is a case that we have been making for weeks now.\xc2\xa0 And I think the case that we have -- that the Senate should fulfill their constitutional responsibility -- is only strengthened now that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear how seriously the President considered his constitutional responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe considered a wide range of candidates and he chose the person that he believes is the best person in America to fulfill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that the last time that Chief Judge Garland faced a confirmation vote in the United States Senate, that he got the support of a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans in that vote.\xc2\xa0 That was 19 years ago.\xc2\xa0 But in that 19 years, he has blazed a trail of a judge who understands that his chief responsibility is to interpret the law and not advance a political agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that the Senate should fulfill their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is not appropriate for anybody in the United States Senate to suggest that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to use politics as an excuse to not do their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some groups on the left have said they\xe2\x80\x99re not enchanted with the President\xe2\x80\x99s choice.\xc2\xa0 They say it was designed to appease Republicans in the Senate rather than fire up the base.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to their concern?\xc2\xa0 And was that the case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s choice was designed to find the very best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels confident that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0 That when you take a look at Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s credentials, you see that they are unquestioned in terms of his legal ability.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody with a demonstrated commitment to public service.\xc2\xa0 The President discussed in the Rose Garden how, early in his career, Chief Judge Garland willingly took a pay cut so that he could work as a federal prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 And he did work here in the District of Columbia, making neighborhoods in this city safer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he certainly demonstrated a commitment to using his extensive legal training and his God-given ability to promote justice.\xc2\xa0 And that was true when he oversaw the investigation of the prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombing.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s justifiably proud of that service to the country.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly is proud of that service.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s that commitment to public service and that commitment to not using his seat on the bench to advance a political agenda, but rather merely to interpret the law in pursuit of justice that has earned him bipartisan support in the past, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly why we believe he deserves bipartisan support today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other quick issue.\xc2\xa0 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s highest court sentenced the 21-year-old University of Virginia student to 15 years in prison with hard labor for allegedly attempting to steal a banner.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction?\xc2\xa0 And is it going to take any specific actions in response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I can tell you -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say this before -- there is no greater priority for this administration than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad.\xc2\xa0 We understand, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports that a North Korean court convicted a U.S. citizen, Otto Warmbier, of hostile acts against the DPRK.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Warmbier was reportedly sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, the allegations for which this individual was arrested and imprisoned would not give rise to arrest or imprisonment in the United States, or in just about any other country in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, despite official claims that U.S. citizens arrested in North Korea are not used for political purposes, it is increasingly clear that the North Korean government seeks to use these U.S. citizens as pawns to pursue a political agenda.\xc2\xa0 This underscores the risks associated with traveling to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And the Department of State strongly recommends against all travel by U.S. citizens to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information about that on the State Department website.\xc2\xa0 And I encourage people to visit Travel.State.gov if for any reason they do happen to be considering travel to North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut now that Mr. Warmbier has gone through this criminal process, we strongly urge the North Korean government to pardon him and grant him special amnesty and immediate release.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President, in choosing Judge Garland, chose somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s 63.\xc2\xa0 Some of his other candidates were roughly 15 years younger.\xc2\xa0 If this candidate, Judge Garland, is confirmed, that means the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy on the Supreme Court will be significantly shorter than it could have been if he had chosen someone who is younger.\xc2\xa0 Why not take that opportunity?\xc2\xa0 To what extent did age play a role in this decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that age played any role in the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe there are some people who would suggest that it would have, but the President was looking for the very best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And regardless of age, the President was focused on choosing somebody who has the proper temperament and the unquestioned legal credentials and a commitment to public service to do this job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, I think the other thing that people should understand is that Justice Ginsburg, when she was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Clinton, she was 60 years old.\xc2\xa0 When Justice Lewis Powell was nominated to the Supreme Court, he was even older than Chief Judge Garland is today.\xc2\xa0 So certainly his appointment -- or his age is -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s older than recent Supreme Court nominees, but he\xe2\x80\x99s entirely within the sort of range of individuals who have the sufficient legal experience to demonstrate that they could serve with distinction on the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, one thing you can say about him is that he\xe2\x80\x99s 63.\xc2\xa0 The other thing you can point out is that he has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.\xc2\xa0 So certainly that kind of experience and that kind of track record I think only strengthens the case that we can make that the President has chosen the best person for the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His qualifications are clearly impeccable.\xc2\xa0 But in choosing somebody who is the best qualified for the job, did the President not also consider choosing someone who could take advantage of this historic opening on the Court to last a little longer, considering the average lifespan of a white male is probably mid-70s?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as is true of everyone who is considered for an appointment like this, Chief Judge Garland underwent a physical and he is somebody who is in good health and certainly could serve for an extended period of time on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 But, Jeff, I\'ll tell you, I know that there are some Presidents who previously sought to use an appointment to the Supreme Court to burnish their legacy, and we can sort of weigh the pros and cons on that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is interested in a legacy that indicates a commitment to focusing on choosing the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s track record over the course of choosing three nominees now to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court, starting with Justice Sotomayor -- Justice Kagan followed shortly thereafter, and now Chief Judge Garland -- that the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy when it comes to choosing Supreme Court justices I think is going to stand up to anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s mutually exclusive, though, Josh, that to choose someone who is the best person for the job but also choose someone who could be there for 20 or 30 years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 And, look, every potential candidate that the President considered brought along his or her own unique set of credentials and experiences.\xc2\xa0 And the President chose the person that he believes is the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And based on his commitment to public service, based on his long track record as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to argue that somehow the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one question on Syria, following up from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen, or has the White House seen any evidence that Russia and President Putin are putting more pressure on Assad as a result of the decision to withdraw their troops?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say is that we have seen evidence of the Russian military following through on the public declaration that President Putin made to begin withdrawing at least some of their military from Syria.\xc2\xa0 As I noted in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, I do not anticipate that we\'ll be able to draw clear conclusions about what impact this changed military posture by the Russians will have on President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating posture.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has been working aggressively with the international community to try to bring the Syrian government into talks with the wide array of opposition groups, and I\'ve previously observed that the way that the Russian military has supported the Assad regime and helped him shore up his grip on power removed a little bit of the incentive to have him negotiate in good faith and toward the kind of political transition that\'s long overdue inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at this point, it\'s too early to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a dramatic change in a negotiating posture.\xc2\xa0 But we intend to work closely with the Russians and other international parties, including the United Nations and other countries that are allies of the United States, to try to push both sides together and engage in the kind of constructive talks that will lead to a political transition that\'s long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Jeff, we have long asserted that there\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution to the situation in Syria, and that\'s why these political talks are so critically important.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans don\'t confirm Judge Garland before the election, is there any possibility the President would withdraw him before the end of his term?\xc2\xa0 And I guess as a corollary to this, just in the last hour or so we\'ve heard some suggestions from Senator Hatch and some others that they might be open to considering him after the elections, I guess, if Democrats win.\xc2\xa0 So what is your early reaction to the notion of a hold on this until after the election, and then some action?\xc2\xa0 Is that better than nothing, or so bad that you would just want to yank Garland start over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is absolutely no good reason to wait until the lame duck for the Senate to fulfill their duty to the Constitution and to the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a nominee just today that is eminently qualified.\xc2\xa0 His credentials are unquestioned.\xc2\xa0 And dating back to over the last 30 or 40 years, the average time that a Supreme Court nominee has had to wait for confirmation in the United States Senate is 67 days.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time for the Senate to do their job.\xc2\xa0 By following roughly that timeline, the Senate could take action in the form of a fair hearing and an up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 And what we would like to see is to see that process completed in that time frame.\xc2\xa0 And it would allow Chief Judge Garland to ascend to the Supreme Court and serve on the Supreme Court when the new Supreme Court term begins in October.</p>\n<p>\n\tStalling his nomination and preventing him from serving on the Supreme Court at the beginning of the next term would be obstruction on a scale that is unprecedented in the last 40 years or so.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been more than four decades since the last time we saw a single Supreme Court vacancy have an impact on two different Supreme Court terms.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as Leader McConnell wrote in an op-ed famously on the day after the midterm elections in 2014, he vowed to use his position of authority and the new Republican majority in the Senate to get Congress moving again.\xc2\xa0 We would welcome him following through on that promise and ensuring that the institution of the Senate functions as the Constitution and the American people expect.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow up.\xc2\xa0 Not to force him into a negotiation now five minutes after you put your guy out there, but, yes, sure, they could do all those things, but they\'re saying they won\xe2\x80\x99t do any of those things.\xc2\xa0 And your calculation that Judge Garland was the best nominee is predicated on a number of things, including the position you\'re in now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if the Democratic nominee for President wins -- I mean, Garland was going to be your guy to replace a conservative a couple years ago, if that\'s what had happened.\xc2\xa0 It might have been a completely different calculation if you controlled the Senate and you were going to control the White House.\xc2\xa0 Would he still be your guy?\xc2\xa0 Forget it.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'re not going to answer that question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get you to answer the question.\xc2\xa0 So the question is, you want them to act now; they\'re saying they\'re not going to act now.\xc2\xa0 Would you be willing to entertain a scenario where they\'re acting in November?\xc2\xa0 Or are you just going -- is your position absolutely not, we\'re not playing that game?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our position is that there is no good reason that anybody can articulate for the Senate to wait until the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 There is no good reason.\xc2\xa0 The only reason that Republicans have put forward is politics.\xc2\xa0 There is nobody who thinks that our partisan political debate in this country should be extended to include the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 The Framers of our Constitution designed the Supreme Court to be insulated as much as possible from that kind of political debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tNobody is suggesting that politics should be fully extracted from it.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re suggesting is that politics should not prevent the basic institutional functioning of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the consequences are significant.\xc2\xa0 Having the process break down would be an unprecedented injection of partisan politics into the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that would be bad for the Court.\xc2\xa0 It would be inconsistent with the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only person that thinks this.\xc2\xa0 Plenty of Republicans have given voice to this view, including President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general who just today wrote an op-ed headline urging the Republicans in the Senate to give Chief Judge Garland a vote.\xc2\xa0 We wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the question is:\xc2\xa0 Does this nomination have an expiration date?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it doesn\'t.\xc2\xa0 The Senate should act --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President will not pull this nomination in a lame duck?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t foresee why the President would do that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re urging primarily because there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason it should take that long.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the Senate has a responsibility to act.\xc2\xa0 And recent precedent indicates that this should only take a couple of months.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way that previous Supreme Court nominees --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aside from -- you\'re saying the President is not going to pull the nomination.\xc2\xa0 So if this doesn\'t get acted on until a lame duck, the President is not going to pull the nomination back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward the individual that he believes is the best person in America to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to stand by that nominee.\xc2\xa0 And the President will make a forceful case to Democrats and Republicans alike in the United States Senate that they should fulfill their constitutional responsibility to give him a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He stands by that nominee until January 20th, I assume?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President stands strongly behind the nominee, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that he should be subjected to an unprecedented delay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was Merrick Garland the first choice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he has, as a prosecutor, two very high-profile cases, sought the death penalty.\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to assume then that Merrick Garland does not believe that the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I could imagine that this would be the kind of pointed question that Chief Judge Garland would face in a confirmation hearing.\xc2\xa0 And look, there is a long --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did this come up with his discussions with the President, though?\xc2\xa0 The death penalty is obviously -- this is an issue that the Court has --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of the kinds of conversations that they had leading up to the President making this decision.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the questions were focused around -- or the conversation was focused around Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the job, his approach to public service, his thinking about and understanding of the law.\xc2\xa0 And there was not a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the President had a punch list of hot-button items that he used to quiz potential nominees.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is much more interested in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the job knowing that interpreting the law based on the specifics of the case is what their responsibility is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just ask you, he\xe2\x80\x99s a Harvard Law grad.\xc2\xa0 The President has nominated a Yale Law grad and a Harvard Law grad in his two previous nominations.\xc2\xa0 I believe all eight justices currently on the Court attended either Harvard or Yale.\xc2\xa0 Of course, Ruth Bader Ginsburg ended up going to Columbia.\xc2\xa0 But they all spent time at Harvard or Yale Law.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible any more for somebody to be nominated to the Supreme Court who didn\'t go to Harvard or Yale?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s with that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President certainly believes that should be possible.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why can\'t he not find anybody that didn\'t go to Harvard or Yale?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s had three chances now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of that process.\xc2\xa0 But I can certainly tell you that the President carefully considered potential nominees that did not go to Ivy League law schools.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple questions on this.\xc2\xa0 Did the President meet with Merrick Garland on Sunday here at the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President did have an opportunity to meet with Chief Judge Garland, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How recently was that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did an interview with CNN Espa\xc3\xb1ol last week.\xc2\xa0 And in that interview, the President indicated that he had begun moving forward with interviews.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that his interview with Chief Judge Garland occurred in that time frame.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any more detail beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he meet with anyone Sunday on this -- meeting the nominees?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to go beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, next, there is a segment of this country, your constituents, who was hopeful from day one that there would be a Supreme Court nominee who could possibly -- not necessarily, but possibly fill the shoes of Thurgood Marshall.\xc2\xa0 And their hopes have been dashed now.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re feeling that there\xe2\x80\x99s no more chance.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to some of those people who were hopeful -- were in the Rose Garden when the President made the announcement today, and they\xe2\x80\x99re supporting the President but they\xe2\x80\x99re still somewhat hurt by not having that potential?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I can tell you that the President considered a diverse array of candidates, and I think that\'s what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect considering the diverse array of individuals that the White House consulted in advance of the President making his decision.\xc2\xa0 The President took that advice quite seriously and considered a diverse array of candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President ultimately settled on Chief Judge Garland for one reason, and one reason only, and that is simply that he believes that Chief Judge Garland is the best person in America to do that job.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s how the President made the decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, April, I can tell you that the President himself has talked on a number of occasions about how important it is to ensure that the federal bench is as diverse as the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And when you take a look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s track record, it\'s quite strong.\xc2\xa0 That starts with the two previous appointments that the President has made to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 He appointed the first Hispanic to the Supreme Court in the form of Justice Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 He appointed the third and fourth women to serve on the Supreme Court in Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan.\xc2\xa0 He has appointed 117 minorities to the federal judiciary.\xc2\xa0 That\'s more than any other President.\xc2\xa0 He has appointed 26 African American women to the federal bench.\xc2\xa0 That is more than any other President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s appointed 37 Hispanics to the federal bench.\xc2\xa0 That is more than any other President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s appointed 20 Asians to the federal bench.\xc2\xa0 That is more than any other President.\xc2\xa0 And he has appointed 11 LGBT judges.\xc2\xa0 That is more than every other President combined.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the principle of ensuring we have a judiciary that looks like the rest of the country is rock-solid.\xc2\xa0 And the other principle that he has strongly adhered to is making sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s choosing the best person for the job, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated over the course of his seven years in office that it is absolutely possible to do both.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So clearly you were ready for this question.\xc2\xa0 Now --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You think?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I did my homework last night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You really did.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the African American community, he has appointed more African American federal judges than any other President -- that is true.\xc2\xa0 But was that in, I guess, the mix at all when you were thinking of the possibility of the next Supreme Court justice, to bring it a step further?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is true -- well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons the President does believe it\'s important to diversify the federal bench is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we have judges who look like the rest of America.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly is an important part of this decision-making process.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that\'s important is that choosing someone to serve on the Supreme Court that has previous experience being a federal judge is, of course, not required, but it\'s a pretty good credential to bring with you.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the President has just nominated Chief Judge Garland, somebody who has more federal judiciary experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history, I think is an indication that the President certainly prioritizes that kind of experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is certainly possible that by diversifying the federal bench more broadly the President is creating a more diverse array of choices for future Presidents as they consider nominees to fill future vacancies on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing -- 97 percent and 93 percent of the African American vote went to President Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0 Does this reflect their hope in him and their push to make sure that he was President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I feel confident in telling you is, to the extent that people have thought about this in some detail, that people are strongly supportive of the kind of criteria that the President has said he would use to choose a Supreme Court nominee.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made good on that promise in terms of choosing somebody who will interpret the law, somebody who will not be focused on advancing a politics agenda, and somebody who will understand that the decisions that are made at the federal bench have a real impact on the lives of Americans.\xc2\xa0 And somebody who understands that this is not just an intellectual exercise that\'s worthy of high-minded debates in the courtroom, that the kinds of issues -- particularly when we\'re talking about the Supreme Court -- those kinds of issues have a tangible impact on people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think we saw in the last Supreme Court term a pretty good illustration of that; that as the Supreme Court was focused on the merits of some of the difficult decisions that they had to make, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the significant, real-world impact of the decision to uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare, or of the ruling that would allow gays and lesbians to get married in every state in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, there are specific legal arguments that should be the focus of intense debate in the courtroom, but there also needs to be a recognition that that has a direct and significant impact on the lives of people all across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the criteria that the President has used in choosing not just his Supreme Court nominees, frankly, but to every nominee that he put forward to the federal bench.\xc2\xa0 But certainly, as he described in the Rose Garden earlier today, that was part of the criteria that he used in selecting Chief Judge Garland.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer it when you were asked, when the President made his decision, you said only recently.\xc2\xa0 Could you be any more specific?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would like to do is to continue to protect the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make those kinds of decisions in private.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly have tried to be as transparent as we can about how the President made the decision in terms of what he was thinking about.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the aspect of this decision that I can do my best to describe to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been that recently if you got that video produced in time to post today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my colleagues in the Office of Digital Strategy can work pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that there are some members of that team that didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much sleep last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how you sneak the candidates into place?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We were told on the conference call that there were five meetings with candidates. \xc2\xa0How do you get them in here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Early lid.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are multiple entrances to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And we use all of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we see the binder now that the decision has been made?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess in some ways it\xe2\x80\x99s a little famous now.\xc2\xa0 But no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make that binder public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question on another issue.\xc2\xa0 Governor Snyder of Michigan is complaining that despite repeated requests, FEMA has turned down its appeals for emergency aid for Flint.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why that is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s start by saying that FEMA has actually provided extensive assistance to the state of Michigan.\xc2\xa0 There are personnel that continue to be on the ground in Michigan, and have been for months, distributing water and distributing water filters to businesses and residences in Flint.\xc2\xa0 Much of that water that is being distributed has actually been provided by FEMA.\xc2\xa0 So there has been extensive emergency assistance provided to the residence of that community.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is also true, Mark, is that there is a law that describes very clearly exactly the conditions under which it is appropriate to declare a federal emergency.\xc2\xa0 And a manmade situation like the one that exists in Flint falls outside of those guidelines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo FEMA and the rest of the federal government has provided extensive assistance to Flint, but we have not done so under the auspices of a declared federal emergency.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to get a sense of what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see in the coming days and weeks, and how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make this happen -- because most of the time you were asked that question, you talked about the constitutional responsibility, so on and so forth.\xc2\xa0 We all know that.\xc2\xa0 Everybody knows that and everybody has got their arguments about how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been since this happened, or that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, or whatever.\xc2\xa0 So what as a practical matter is the White House going to do?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned on the call earlier that the judge has already started making calls up to the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to make more calls?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see public speeches?\xc2\xa0 Is there some discussion with the Clinton campaign, the Sanders campaign about talking about this on the campaign trail?\xc2\xa0 Can you just give us a sense of what we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that you\xe2\x80\x99re really trying to make this happen, besides just the talking about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a couple of things that I can try to tell you about from here.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, Chief Judge Garland will be traveling to Capitol Hill tomorrow, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll begin the process of making courtesy visits to individual members of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll, of course, be focused on meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but I know that there are other members of the United States Senate who will ultimately have a vote who are pretty enthusiastic about having the opportunity to sit down with Chief Judge Garland and talk to him about this important appointment.\xc2\xa0 So that process will begin tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are any Republicans on the list?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that certainly Republicans have been asked whether or not, and when, they would receive Chief Judge Garland.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of them indicate a willingness to meet with him.\xc2\xa0 Senator Cochran has said, I will give any consideration to a nominee.\xc2\xa0 Senator Ayotte has said that, I would want to explain my position to the nominee and give him that courtesy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen both Senator Collins and Senator Flake indicate that they plan to meet with him.\xc2\xa0 Senator Collins described him as \xe2\x80\x9cmy job.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen Senator Inhofe -- somebody that I don\xe2\x80\x99t charitably cite from this podium too often -- but even he today indicated that he will evaluate the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing primarily because, as I recall, he voted for Judge Garland in 1997 to confirm him to an appointment on the D.C. Circuit.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of Republicans come forward and indicate that they would sit down with Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing -- we demonstrated on the front end, from day one, that President Obama was committed to serious consultation with the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 The President believed that that consultation was important prior to putting forward a nominee.\xc2\xa0 But the consultation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end there.\xc2\xa0 If anything, it only ramps up from there.\xc2\xa0 And so I would anticipate that in addition to Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s visits, that there will be additional conversations, including, at some point, at the presidential level about the need for the United States Senate to fulfill their constitutional duty.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said in those discussions -- or they did on the call -- that the President offered people to put up names.\xc2\xa0 Did anyone put up Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xc2\xa0 Did any Republicans put up his name?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you heard -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be at liberty to discuss the details of private presidential conversations.\xc2\xa0 But the good news is, is that the President occasionally is at the liberty -- takes liberty to do so.\xc2\xa0 And he described in the Rose Garden that frequently when he had discussions with Democrats and Republicans about who would make a good Supreme Court justice, that Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s name came up.\xc2\xa0 That, I think, is an indication of the kind of bipartisan or even consensus appeal that Chief Judge Garland has.\xc2\xa0 That is, after all, consensus.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the word that Senator Hatch has use to describe Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President I think is serious about -- has demonstrated that he\xe2\x80\x99s serious about doing his job, about being thoughtful, about working expeditiously, and putting forward a nominee, frankly, whose legal credentials I haven\'t seen anybody be really willing to argue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President will have meetings again with Senator McConnell and Grassley directly?\xc2\xa0 Will he reach out to them now that there\xe2\x80\x99s a nominee?\xc2\xa0 Because again, this is one of your -- you said that once the names comes up, things will change.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out.\xc2\xa0 And I know that Chief Judge Garland is interested in sitting down with both Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll have that opportunity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will you let us know if they say yes or no?\xc2\xa0 I would imagine it would be high on his list.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to start with the committee, I would imagine.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can commit to every single conversation that Chief Judge Garland has being made public.\xc2\xa0 But there certainly will be extensive outreach, and there is genuine interest in talking to Republicans about his nomination.\xc2\xa0 And he will spend some time on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And when he does that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in public.\xc2\xa0 And I suppose many of you will cross paths with him in the hallways.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this notion of -- this issue of diversity is a big deal.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has had direct discussions with civil rights activists, leaders from that community about the fact that he did not choose a person of color for this particular job.\xc2\xa0 And the other thing is, when you keep saying that he was the very best person for the job, clearly the President knows and is probably aware that that is something that\xe2\x80\x99s often said, or has been over the years, to minority candidates for jobs, and never given a specific answer to why candidate A or candidate B.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is, to what extent has the President addressed this issue directly to leaders from that community -- or will he, going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, I can tell you that the President and his team did extensive outreach to a wide variety of groups, including civil rights groups, prior to making this decision.\xc2\xa0 And the President has done that prior to making other important personnel decisions.\xc2\xa0 And look, I went through the record of appointments at the federal bench, and I did that because I think it is a good illustration that the President believes strongly that you can choose the best person for the job and make it a priority to diversify the federal bench, that those two things are not at all mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, I think the President has proved definitively that it is possible to do both.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is particularly proud of his record.\xc2\xa0 It was true when he appointed the first Hispanic justice to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It certainly was true when he appointed Justice Kagan to the Supreme Court. And the President believes that nominating Chief Judge Garland is putting forward the name of the best person for the Supreme Court this time, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think that Judge Garland is going to generate the enthusiasm out there in the grassroots and in the Democratic base that\'s going to be a decisive thing in putting him over the top and changing this -- knocking down this roadblock you\'re meeting with the Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, I can tell you definitively that the President did not choose Chief Judge Garland because of the impact it would have on politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tI recognize that there are Senate Republicans who are making a very specific decision to oppose Chief Judge Garland because of politics.\xc2\xa0 Senator Ron Johnson committed that classic Washington gaffe of saying the thing accidentally that everybody knows is true, which is that Senate Republicans are blocking the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court because the President is in a different political party than they are.\xc2\xa0 He acknowledged that if it were President Romney making this decision, that they would be looking at it a whole lot differently.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the irony is that was even before Senator Johnson knew who President Obama was going to put forward.\xc2\xa0 And that indicates the degree to which partisan politics has polluted this process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody would dispute that.\xc2\xa0 But the question then still is, how do you change that?\xc2\xa0 How do you -- in that environment that I think we would all agree exists, what are you going to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we have seen, just in the few hours since Chief Judge Garland has been nominated, that no one has really raised any legitimate objections to his legal credentials; that on the merits, it is pretty clear what the Senate should do.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to pursue this nomination on the merits.\xc2\xa0 We\'re genuinely interested in continued consultation with Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, members of the Senate will have to decide if they\'re going to put politics ahead of their constitutional duties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I do have my own estimation about how that will play politically.\xc2\xa0 But that, frankly, is not part of the calculation.\xc2\xa0 That was certainly not the motivation for this decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President took quite seriously his responsibility to put forward the very best person.\xc2\xa0 And look, as a couple people have pointed out now, there are a few people who I think vote pretty reliably Democrat that don\'t wholeheartedly agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 I think that, as much as anything, is a testament to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to protecting this process from further political pollution.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Are we in the midst of a constitutional crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say that.\xc2\xa0 Right now there is still ample time for the United States Senate to fulfill their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And as the President observed, the Senate is prepared to go on a two-week recess.\xc2\xa0 I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s spring break, if you will.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully they\xe2\x80\x99ll spend part of that time considering how much of a priority their constitutional responsibilities are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if enough Republicans conclude that their constitutional priorities or responsibilities should take precedent over any sort of political calculation, then this process should be able to move forward accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, it is Republicans who have described -- at least one Republican, a leading Republican who has described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is not some -- I know so often in Washington, and I know this this happens a lot in the halls of Congress, that a lot of these kinds of situations get reduced to, well, gee, is the President going to win?\xc2\xa0 Or is the President\xe2\x80\x99s side going to win?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to get his way?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is fulfilling his constitutional responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward somebody of unquestioned legal experience and credentials, somebody who has earned the strong support of Republicans in the past; somebody who has a 19-year track record of fulfilling his obligation to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has served his country with distinction already in pursuit of justice.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no reason that politics has to factor into this.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, Republicans should be proud to confirm somebody like Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 The truth is this has the potential to not just be an important part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, this is an important part of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, too.\xc2\xa0 And they do have an opportunity to confirm to the Supreme Court -- to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court somebody that everyone acknowledges would serve on the Supreme Court with distinction.\xc2\xa0 Or their legacy can be an unprecedented effort motivated purely by partisan politics to block the confirmation of a nominee that they themselves acknowledge is a consensus choice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about what Vice President Biden said in \xe2\x80\x9992 when he said the Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over?\xc2\xa0 The so-called \xe2\x80\x9cBiden Rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What about when the President in 2006 said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do one at a time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Senator Biden at the time, the very next comment that he made after was that he would give careful consideration to a consensus nominee that was put forward by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that disqualify what he said before that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it suggests that if we want to follow the \xe2\x80\x9cBiden rule,\xe2\x80\x9d then Senate Republicans should do exactly as Senator Biden did.\xc2\xa0 And what he did was he presided over Judiciary Committee hearings that resulted in the successful confirmation of Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 I raise that because that\'s the last time that a confirmation vote for the Supreme Court was held in a presidential election year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then should I just disregard the first part of this statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you should look carefully at what Senator Biden did.\xc2\xa0 And you should look carefully at what he said, which is that he would support a consensus nominee.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Republicans should do the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the President, when he said in 2006 that he would support a filibuster of Sam Alito because he felt that he, in fact, was somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s contrary to the core of American values?\xc2\xa0 There are those who feel like Chief Judge Garland is an opponent of the Second Amendment, and they feel very strongly that that would be contrary to their values.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, they\'re saying that even though Judge Garland hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a confirmation hearing yet.\xc2\xa0 So they haven\xe2\x80\x99t even -- they\'re not even going to give him an opportunity to speak for himself, to describe his record.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the truth is, I have not heard that many Republicans raise substantive objections about his nomination.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Obama at the time did indicate that he had substantive objections to Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t think anybody made the case -- even Republicans made the case that Justice Alito was a consensus pick.\xc2\xa0 And maybe there are people out there Googling some quotes right now to try to prove me wrong, in which case I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for the record to be corrected.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\'t recall anybody making that case.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, you have Republicans making the case that Chief Judge Garland is a consensus nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this then:\xc2\xa0 Is the White House spoiling for a fight?\xc2\xa0 Are you looking for a fight here?\xc2\xa0 Is this a fight that you\'re eager to wage with Republicans not just in the Senate, but broadly speaking?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think, Kevin, what we most want the Senate to do is to not fight, but to actually fulfill their constitutional responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, that does not mean -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not in any way suggesting that the Senate should somehow go easy on Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 There should be a legitimate and rigorous process for considering his nomination.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we welcome the opportunity for Chief Judge Garland to begin courtesy visits and private conversations with members of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we welcome the opportunity for the Senate Judiciary Committee to convene hours of hearings to ask him about his long legal record.\xc2\xa0 That is entirely how the process should work.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is how the process worked for Justice Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is how the process worked for Justice Kagan.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that\'s exactly how the process should work for Chief Judge Garland.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that anybody -- that the process should be easy.\xc2\xa0 But I am suggesting that there is no reason it has to be a political fight.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the eventuality if we go through this entire year, past January 2017, and he doesn\'t get an up or down vote?\xc2\xa0 What word or words would you use to describe what has then happened to Chief Judge Garland?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would leave it to Senator Graham to offer up his description of that.\xc2\xa0 And he said at the last Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that that would be unprecedented, that Republicans would be establishing a brand-new precedent if they were to resist hearings for almost an entire year on Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.\xc2\xa0 And in that respect, Senator Graham has it exactly right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tit for tat then.\xc2\xa0 You would say then that the GOP should expect that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get the same thing if a President Trump, for example, had a nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the Senate on that. \xc2\xa0And hopefully -- I guess my case would be simply this:\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to that.\xc2\xa0 It really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And if Republicans in the Senate want to strengthen their case that the next Republican President should be able to fulfill his or her constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, then the strongest signal that they can send is just to do what the President said today, which is treat Chief Judge Garland fairly.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all we\'re looking for here, is just a little bit of fairness.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s ironic because that\'s what we expect our judges to do.\xc2\xa0 We want our judges to be fair.\xc2\xa0 And during his 19-year history and career on the bench, that\'s exactly what Chief Judge Garland has done, is that he is somebody who has established a well-earned reputation for being fair.\xc2\xa0 Republicans would even agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re just asking for the same kind of fair treatment of Judge Garland by Senate Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have said that wanting to overturn the 2010 Citizens United case is a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees under their presidency.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with them and have a litmus test on that case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that the President had any litmus tests for Chief Judge Garland or for his previous nominees to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Citizens United or campaign finance in general come up during discussions or vetting?\xc2\xa0 I know the President has broadly spoken about wanting to overturn that case, and it\'s been a progressive goal for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that factored into the decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into the details of the President\xe2\x80\x99s private conversations with Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned to Jon, the President did not have a punch list of hot-button items that he wanted to quiz potential nominees on.\xc2\xa0 Rather, the President had a broader discussion with them about their approach to the law and their commitment to interpreting the law, not using it to advance a political agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would just make the case one more time that this is exactly why you have confirmation hearings, is so that Democrats and Republicans on the committee can ask the nominee tough questions.\xc2\xa0 And I have no doubt that if the Judiciary Committee were to hold hearings, that you\xe2\x80\x99d probably find Democrats asking Chief Judge Garland about the issue of campaign finance reform.\xc2\xa0 So I think that would make for a pretty interesting discussion.\xc2\xa0 I have to admit I\'d watch it carefully.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the way the process should work.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, since you can\'t tell us when the President made his decision, can you tell us why he made it public today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, today actually falls within this timeline that we previously discussed in here.\xc2\xa0 When vacancies occurred earlier in the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- Supreme Court vacancies occurred earlier in the President\xe2\x80\x99s term in office, that typically the President put forward a nominee to fill those vacancies in four to five weeks.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re, I believe, in the fifth week since Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s part of the time frame that we used to make this decision.\xc2\xa0 There also was a sense -- and many of you asked me about this -- that there would be some advantages to making this announcement prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s departure on his trip to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 So there was an effort to try to announce this before the President\xe2\x80\x99s departure, and that\'s what we\'ve done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wouldn\'t have anything to do with the news cycle and the events of last night in terms of primaries and political attention?\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether that was in any way part of the calculus?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a date that had been on our calendar for a while now.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think much serious consideration was given to making this announcement on the day that there were five or six presidential primaries held.\xc2\xa0 But certainly today was an appropriate day, well within the time frame that we had established, and well before the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 This announcement will also give Chief Judge Garland the opportunity to visit with some members of the United States Senate before they leave on their two-week spring break recess.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the other benefit of making this announcement on a Wednesday, is that it means that the Senate is still in town on Thursday and the senators will still be around to meet with him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that -- well, you\'re obviously counting meetings with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if Ted Cruz has agreed to meet with Garland?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen any public statements from Senator Cruz.\xc2\xa0 He seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty busy on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to Arizona or something to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Being on the Judiciary Committee --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99d welcome the opportunity for Senator Cruz to sit down with him.\xc2\xa0 But I also understand that Senator Cruz has got some other business that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on right now, too.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not suggesting that that\xe2\x80\x99s somehow inappropriate, but hopefully there will be an opportunity at a time that is convenient for Senator Cruz, for him to sit down with Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 Because I think what they would find is that even though Senator Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s political views are quite different than the political views of the President of the United States, any fair-minded person -- and I think that we\'ve seen even some unfair-minded people acknowledge that Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s legal credentials are beyond reproach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask you, how do you gauge how much the political heat has impacted the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the White House has made the point of describing Merrick Garland as a moderate.\xc2\xa0 He\'s not progressive, he\xe2\x80\x99s not playing to the base necessarily, or pleasing them.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps offering someone who could be more palatable.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously it was part of the calculus.\xc2\xa0 How much of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President chose the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And let me try to illustrate that in a different way. \xc2\xa0In 2009 and 2010, there was a Supreme Court vacancy in each of those years.\xc2\xa0 Those were two years in which Democrats had a strong majority in the United States Senate, and yet the President put forward nominees to the Supreme Court that got, as you would expect, strong support from Senate Democrats, but both of them also got at least some support from Senate Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach here, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in playing politics.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in playing to the base.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s interested in choosing the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And that was true even when there was -- when Democrats had a substantial majority in the United States Senate in 2009 and 2010, and it\'s true now that Republicans are in the majority here in 2016.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll just say more generally, I do find it quite disappointing that Republicans are suggesting that somehow politics is an appropriate excuse to doing their job.\xc2\xa0 And I would actually make the case that there is a golden opportunity here to demonstrate that Senator McConnell can get the Congress moving again, that it would be easy for this to get bogged down in partisan politics, but particularly now that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just put forward the best person for the job, but he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward somebody that at least some Republicans agree are worthy of Republican support in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is an opportunity, even in the midst of this intense partisan back-and-forth on the campaign trail, to demonstrate for the American people that Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C. can get together and do the right thing for the country.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even require Republicans to make a significant concession.\xc2\xa0 Because again, Senator Hatch is a conservative.\xc2\xa0 Nobody would question that.\xc2\xa0 Senator Hatch is somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of experience evaluating federal judges.\xc2\xa0 Nobody would question that.\xc2\xa0 Senator Hatch has described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he said he won\xe2\x80\x99t support a hearing for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, this is a golden opportunity that Republicans have to demonstrate that they can leave the country, that they can be trusted to be in charge of significant institutions of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And again, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require them to make concessions.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even really require them to compromise that much.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has put forward the person that he believes is the best person for the job, but that person also happens to have earned praise from plenty of Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I do think is true is the President has not just chosen the best person for the job; he\xe2\x80\x99s also chosen somebody that it should be easy for Republicans to support.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require them to fold on their principles.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require them to cave to the Democratic President.\xc2\xa0 It just requires them to demonstrate a commitment to governing the country and protecting the institution of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a change of heart when they go to their home districts for Easter break and back away from their public positions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is true, Margaret -- and you guys would be in a better position to assess this than I would be -- is that while there has been a stern posture that Republicans have taken publicly, they haven\'t looked particularly comfortable in doing it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make a principled case, based on the selection of a consensus nominee, that Republicans in the Senate should put their constitutional duties ahead of any more narrow political considerations they may make.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have said so much about Garland\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications that he\xe2\x80\x99s the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 But given that he has been considered before, those qualifications during those periods of time clearly weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough then.\xc2\xa0 So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be an indication that now the difference is the politics; that now he\xe2\x80\x99s perfect to be the consensus candidate that maybe others weren\xe2\x80\x99t then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will just say that each time the President has had to make this decision he\xe2\x80\x99s considered a diverse array of candidates.\xc2\xa0 And each time he\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on choosing the individual that he believes could best fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to remind you that each time the President has done that, even when Democrats were in the majority, he put forward nominees that earned Republican support.\xc2\xa0 The President is proud of that king of record.\xc2\xa0 He has a track record of putting forward individuals whose legal credentials are such that even Republicans are comfortable supporting them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if it was not a very political environment in 2009 or 2010.\xc2\xa0 It was a pretty intense period in American politics too.\xc2\xa0 And yet, even in the midst of that intensity, the President did put forward nominees -- despite having a strong Democratic majority in the Senate, he put forward nominees that earned the support of some Republican senators.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask then, if he is such a stellar, perfect guy for the job now, why was he not twice before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, simply I would say that in 2009, the President nominated Justice Sonia Sotomayor because he believed that she was the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 In 2010, he concluded that Justice Kagan was the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And given the candidates before him in 2016, the President chose Chief Judge Garland because he believes that he\xe2\x80\x99s the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is, there are at least some Republicans who understand why the President arrived at that decision and don\xe2\x80\x99t entirely disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can you say when Garland himself was notified that he was the nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that answer to the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when he had a conversation with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And today, the White House mentioned a handful of candidates interviewed, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard the number five.\xc2\xa0 Can you say if that is accurate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific number to share from here in terms of who the President considered.\xc2\xa0 I can just say in general that the President considered a pretty diverse array of potential candidates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned before in here that there is some optimism on your part -- you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing here and there some signs to be optimistic that the Senate could actually give this nominee a shot.\xc2\xa0 Today, your staffers mentioned that now that a few or a handful of senators have said they would be willing under some circumstances to at least meet with him -- I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s be realistic, is that a sign that they could consider him and take this further than just a meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly hope that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive sign.\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that after those private meetings occur, that those senators will walk away impressed.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll see the same person that President Obama has seen in his conversations with Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll seem somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s committed to the rule of law, somebody who values public service, somebody who understands that as a judge you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to be using our authority to advance a political agenda, but rather you\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for interpreting the law with justice in mind.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of credentials that Chief Judge Garland brings to the job.\xc2\xa0 I also think that he brings, as he described in the Rose Garden, a sense of humility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a decent chance that this will go to a hearing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve long avoided laying odds on Senate action.\xc2\xa0 Maybe the sports books are open for business in Vegas on this question today.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s probably some money going to both sides.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hazard a guess at this point.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that if considered solely on the merits, there would be little, if any, drama surrounding this confirmation process.\xc2\xa0 But unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the situation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the importance -- the possibility that public pressure could have an effect on this.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re also doing a lot of outreach.\xc2\xa0 So at this point, if there is a chance that you believe there is, that this could move forward, what\xe2\x80\x99s more important -- the public\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of this or the personal outreach that is still going to go on?\xc2\xa0 What do you think is most likely to sway this process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the truth is, I think that it probably depends on the senator.\xc2\xa0 I think there are some senators who, if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to keep an open mind and have a serious legitimate conversation with Chief Judge Garland, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll come away from that conversation with ample reasons to support his nomination.\xc2\xa0 And so I think for some people having that conversation will be critical to them ultimately deciding.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor some others, there may be some resistance.\xc2\xa0 And the only thing that would change their mind would be a forceful expression of public opinion.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see if that materializes -- and if it does, what kind of impact it has on individual senators.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I do think that this is a situation where Republicans have an opportunity to demonstrate that their constitutional duties come first.\xc2\xa0 And demonstrating that commitment to their responsibilities is certainly a good way for them to live up to their rhetoric about the sanctity of the United States Constitution.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is a good way for them to demonstrate to their voters that they can handle the responsibility of governing the greatest country in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that public pressure will materialize?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I think according to some polls that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, there are some indications that public opinion is not on the side of Republicans putting politics ahead of their constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 Whether that has an impact on anybody\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and whether that has an impact on anybody\xe2\x80\x99s race is probably something that you all will have to take a close look at and figure out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we certainly believe that the public is on our side because it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty open-and-shut case.\xc2\xa0 This is not a complicated, detailed, nuanced argument that I\xe2\x80\x99m making up here.\xc2\xa0 I think this is an argument that appeals to people\xe2\x80\x99s notion of fairness and common sense.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to root our arguments in those notions that the vast majority of Americans -- whether they\'re a Democrat or a Republican -- I think agrees with.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to turn Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question on its head and just sort of -- you can acknowledge that there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 implacable opposition to any consideration of this nomination continues until the election, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 And it is not the first time that we have encountered intense Republican opposition even in the face of a common-sense notion.\xc2\xa0 That certainly would not be unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 What would be unprecedented is subjecting a nominee, particularly a consensus nominee, as Senator Hatch described, to this kind of obstruction.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s not just my assessment.\xc2\xa0 That\'s actually the assessment of Senator Lindsey Graham.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s precedented or unprecedented, it certainly seems likely that that will be the course of action over the next year, Josh, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is certainly possible that Republicans will choose that approach.\xc2\xa0 Again, they have in the past -- we have seen Republicans demonstrate implacable opposition and obstruction to other pretty common-sense ideas.\xc2\xa0 We have also seen a number of situations where Republicans have demonstrated an implacable opposition to a common-sense idea, and then to fold without a whole lot of previous warning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s why I would say that it certainly is possible that Republicans would choose and follow through on this unprecedented approach.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that Republicans will change course.\xc2\xa0 They have in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a long game in front of you.\xc2\xa0 Can you at all give us some details about how you intend to create the forceful expression of public opinion as you were talking about before that you hope would lead to Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s consideration by the Senate?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Stephanie Cutter on the outside who is trying to coordinate the outside groups.\xc2\xa0 Will that coordination then come back into the White House?\xc2\xa0 What are you guys going to do to help put as much political pressure on Republicans to reverse their stance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Gardiner, from the White House perspective, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about politics.\xc2\xa0 And I think the kind of pressure that we can apply to the Senate is making a forceful, principled argument about Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s credentials, and his experience, and the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s got more federal judicial experience than any other nominee in Supreme Court history.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make a principled case that even Republicans have observed that he is a consensus nominee.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make the principled case that seven Republicans, including some Republicans that don\'t often side with this White House, have previously supported Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s appointment to the federal bench.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make the principled observation that even in those 19 intervening years where he has handled some of the most difficult and complex issues that any judge in the federal government considers, that he has not left anybody with the impression that he has abandoned a commitment to fair interpretation of the law.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the argument that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that there will be plenty of people on the outside who will be seeking to create a political advantage on both sides of this argument.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s entirely legitimate.\xc2\xa0 The question for the United States Senate is, are they going to allow the debate to be dominated by politics, or are they going to follow their constitutional duties?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions outside of the SCOTUS stuff.\xc2\xa0 Is there a White House reaction to the Syrian Kurdish party\xe2\x80\x99s push to declare a semi-autonomous region across northern Syria?\xc2\xa0 This is a story that we have going today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have to admit, Gardiner, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that story.\xc2\xa0 But why don\xe2\x80\x99t we look --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, I just want to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with Yalies.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear about that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And do you have a reaction to former Brazilian President Lula joining the cabinet in Brazil, potentially protecting him from corruption allegations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report, either, I have to admit.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on some other topics of the day.\xc2\xa0 But we can get back to you on both of those things.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that we circulate that broadly.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris, in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the number of cases within the LGBT community (inaudible) the Supreme Court whether LGBT people are covered under general protection under current civil rights law and the constitutionality of HIV (inaudible) preservation of the ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 What would be your message to LGBT people who are looking to the Supreme Court for equal justice under the law for them as they examine the Garland nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I think what I would simply observe is that the Supreme Court has important work to do, and they are handling some issues that can and will have a profound impact on the day-to-day lives of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I would associate myself with the comments of President Reagan, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people\xe2\x80\x99s business in that crucially important body.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s right about that.\xc2\xa0 And given the significance of the cases that are before the Supreme Court and will be before the Supreme Court in the next term.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that the Senate should act without delay on the nomination of someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court that they have described as a consensus nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you said you declined to give details of the conversations the President has had with Judge Garland on certain issues, I just wanted to pose the ones that I mentioned with regards to equal justice in the law for LGBT people.\xc2\xa0 Did that come up at all in the conversations the President had with the judge?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into their private conversations.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President did not use his private conversations -- interviews, if you want to describe them that way -- with potential nominees as an opportunity to interrogate them over specific issues.\xc2\xa0 The President is much more interested in understanding their approach to the law and their approach to the work that we ask judges to do.\xc2\xa0 And certainly when it comes to Chief Judge Garland, he is somebody that has an established track record and somebody who has spent decades thinking about the best way for judges to fulfill their responsibility to interpret the law and not advance a political agenda.\xc2\xa0 So that was the nature of the conversation that they had.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 In other important news, the President picked his brackets today for the tournament.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He picked Kansas.\xc2\xa0 Did you have any influence there?\xc2\xa0 Do you ever have influence there?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s picked them more than anyone else.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not have any influence on that decision.\xc2\xa0 This is another judgment that the President arrived at after extensive consultation.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And, ultimately, this decision was up to him and he chose the very best team in the bracket to win.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consensus choice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, given that they are the number-one overall seed, I think you might describe them as the consensus pick.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Senator Hatch would --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Yale.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Yale, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Senator Hatch would agree that they are the consensus pick, but certainly the President is looking forward to the tournament starting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:03 P.M.
