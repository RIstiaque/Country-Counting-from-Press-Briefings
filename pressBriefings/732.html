IST</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do this on background -- senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have the statement from the President?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, we do.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just make a couple of comments and then turn it over here.\xc2\xa0 The President considers both Turkey and Israel to be very close partners and friends of the United States.\xc2\xa0 He has a very close relationship with both Prime Minister Erdogan and Prime Minister Netanyahu, and of course believes strongly that the national security interests of the United States, Turkey, Israel, and frankly, the region are served by normalized Israel-Turkey relations.</p>\n<p>You saw the President go into that trailer with the Prime Minister before the departure ceremony.\xc2\xa0 That\'s when the call was placed from Prime Minister Netanyahu to Prime Minister Erdogan.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll turn it over to my colleague here to give a bit more of the background.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So that is really the context.\xc2\xa0 The United States has important friendships and strategic relationships with both Israel and Turkey, and the President has those relationships with his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have regretted for a couple of years now the absence of normalization -- normal relations between those two countries.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked with them and urged them both to reach out and try to put their differences between them.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been difficult, but that\'s why this call that took place today was important, because it was a sign that both of them -- the two Prime Ministers said that to each other -- value their own relationship between Turkey and Israel.</p>\n<p>And maybe just to give you a flavor of the call itself and more of the context, Prime Minister Netanyahu told Prime Minister Erdogan that he had been discussing with President Obama the importance of regional relations, importance of regional cooperation, and that President Obama had underscored how important it is to us to see all of these countries in the region work with each other, and particularly Turkey and Israel.\xc2\xa0 And he, Netanyahu, wanted to relay that to Prime Minister Erdogan, which he did.</p>\n<p>He also told Prime Minister Erdogan that he had seen his interview in a Danish newspaper and that he, Netanyahu, appreciated those comments.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll get this -- I\'m sure the Israelis and Turks will read this all out.</p>\n<p>And then he -- again, Netanyahu -- brought up the issue that had been dividing them mostly over the past couple of years, which is the flotilla incident, the Mavi Mamara\xc2\xa0 incident, and what he told him is that he regretted that that incident had led to a deterioration in their relations.\xc2\xa0 It was important --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Netanyahu said this --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Netanyahu said that he regretted that that incident had led to a deterioration in their relations, and also that in light of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s investigation into that incident, which revealed some operational mistakes, that on behalf of Israel he apologized for any deaths that those operational mistakes may have caused, and he hoped that the two countries would be able to normalize their relationship and work together effectively in the future.</p>\n<p>And Prime Minister Erdogan said he appreciated those remarks, that on behalf of Turkey, he accepted that apology, and that he cherished the longstanding relationship between Turkey and Israel, between Jewish people and Turkey, and that he also wanted to have a better relationship.</p>\n<p>So in that sense, it was a really positive call.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was very pleased that these two leaders, these two important partners of the United States, were able to take this important step forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President get on the line?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The President did get on the line.\xc2\xa0 He expressed his greetings to Prime Minister Erdogan and suggested they, themselves, talk more in detail in the near future.\xc2\xa0 But it was a call between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Prime Minister Erdogan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what did the President do to facilitate this whole thing?\xc2\xa0 What was his role?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, in one way, the timing of the call speaks for itself, and as I noted, Prime Minister Netanyahu, when he began that call, he began by saying to Prime Minister Erdogan, I\'ve been discussing with President Obama the importance of regional relations, the importance of Turkey-Israel cooperation, and that is what led him to take this initiative now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the apology that Netanyahu offered and that Erdogan accepted is the apology that the Turks have been looking for for all these years?\xc2\xa0 And did they also mention Prime Minister Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s rather pungent comments that I asked Secretary Kerry about in Ankara a couple of weeks ago?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I noted, Prime Minister Erdogan accepted the apology on behalf of Turkey.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that the apology he was --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, he accepted it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they want more that you know of?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, he accepted the apology -- no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this does it?\xc2\xa0 This ends this?\xc2\xa0 This is over?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 He accepted the apology.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let the other governments speak to this in detail, but he accepted the apology and as the President said in his statement, we welcome steps that normalize the relationship.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would it be accurate to say the President brokered this thing?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think it would be accurate to say the President has been making this point to both leaders for going on a couple years now.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s well known by both Turkey and Israel the importance we place on seeing these two close friends of ours have normalized relations.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this is an Israeli-Turkey decision that -- as my colleague said, the timing kind of speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 I will say also there will still be differences on issues between Turkey and Israel, but we do believe that they can cooperate while they have differences.\xc2\xa0 And so taking these important steps to put this behind them allows them to move forward in that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Had they been working on this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- at Herzl\xe2\x80\x99s tomb this morning, the comments -- everyone\xe2\x80\x99s comments about Zionism and crime against humanity come up?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu told Prime Minister Erdogan that he had seen his interview in a Danish newspaper and that he appreciated his words.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to say -- I mean, did the President in his meetings with Netanyahu this week, did he say he\xe2\x80\x99d like to facilitate this call while he was here?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think he discussed the importance of Turkey and Israel working to repair their relationship, and the two of them in their discussions agreed on that, and Prime Minister Netanyahu placed a call.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But had they been working on this all during the day?\xc2\xa0 There was a series of meetings obviously today.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that was a large part of their discussion?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t get too much of the details, the operational details.\xc2\xa0 They agreed it would be a good thing for Netanyahu to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- back at the airport?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, obviously it came up before they got to the tarmac in the airport.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know, but, I mean, why do it on the tarmac at the airport?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You had to get three leaders together when they were able to do the call.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how long has this been -- so for how long has this been being coordinated?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Over the last couple of days that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.\xc2\xa0 We put out a comment yesterday you may have seen saying that this is a subject that came up in the discussions between the President and Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 So it was a topic of discussion during the visit and we were able to get this call scheduled while President Obama was still here.\xc2\xa0 Again, it was a call from Prime Minister Netanyahu to Prime Minister Erdogan, but given the President\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with both of them, he felt it was important to support that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how long they spoke and who all was a party to the call?\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you heard both sides of the call -- was it a conference call?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, they spoke for -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact details -- a good half an hour.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you guys saw -- I mean, basically he went into that trailer, and however long he was in there was how long the call was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So like a half an hour?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, keep in mind there\xe2\x80\x99s also interpretation and President Obama was on the phone for a bit -- but I just wanted to reinforce my colleagues point.\xc2\xa0 No one is claiming that this resolves every potential different between Israel and Turkey.\xc2\xa0 I think we said and I think they would tell you this was an important step because one of the key things that had been dividing them was their strong differences over the Mavi Mamara\xc2\xa0 incident and Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s desire for an apology and compensation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there compensation?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And their teams have over the past years been talking about resolving these issues and the references made to the work that they had done to reach an agreement on that as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the United States think that now this satisfies Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s demand for an apology over this incident?\xc2\xa0 From your point of view, did the Turks say to you, this apology thing is now a thing of the past?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Only the Turks can answer that question, but when the Prime Minister says, I accept your apology, I think most people would believe that that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t say only the Turks can answer that question, and then tell us that he accepted the apology.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wrap this up, but let me just -- we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important thing that these two countries, even as they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have differences, can work together.\xc2\xa0 And this step is what allows that to take place.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support both of these key partners of the United States as they move forward not just in dealing with their own relations, but in dealing with regional security challenges that both of them have a significant stake in because we all have an interest in peace and stability in this region.\xc2\xa0 With that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you describe the diplomatic relationship between these two countries now?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the call today is an important step towards the normalization of that relationship.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t4:34 P.M.
