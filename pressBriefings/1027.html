CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 How are you all today?\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good to be back, after a long but very successful trip to the Asia Pacific region with the President.\xc2\xa0 Those of you who were on that trip know the substantial accomplishments that came out of it, including broadly making clear that the United States will be all in when it comes to Asia, and the importance of the Asia Pacific region economically to this country\'s future.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have a couple of things to announce, and then we can take your questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, President Obama spoke earlier today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, to congratulate him on his appointment and to thank him for taking on such a significant responsibility at a critical time.\xc2\xa0 The President expressed his full confidence in Italy\'s strength and vibrancy, and underscored America\'s support for the steps that Italy is taking to advance its economic reform program.\xc2\xa0 The President also reaffirmed the close alliance and friendship between the United States and Italy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'d also like to draw your attention to the fact that tomorrow, in New Hampshire, the President will meet with a family and make remarks urging Congress to act to extend and expand the payroll tax cut that has given tax breaks to millions of families across this country.\xc2\xa0 If Congress fails to act to extend the current payroll tax cut, a typical family making $50,000 a year would see their taxes rise by $1,000 at the beginning of next year, at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the American Jobs Act, the President proposed to expand that tax cut by cutting payroll taxes in half, so a typical family would get an even larger tax cut next year.\xc2\xa0 The typical family making $50,000 a year would get a tax cut of $1,500 if Congress acts.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also proposed a full payroll tax holiday on any increase in payroll for firms that hire new workers, providing millions of businesses an incentive to create new jobs. With the holiday season approaching, the Congress -- the President, rather, will urge Congress to act not just to ensure that taxes don\'t go up on middle-class families at the beginning of the year, but also to pass tax breaks for families and small businesses in the American Jobs Act to help strengthen the recovery and create jobs now.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are my announcements.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Kuhnhenn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back to gridlock.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The supper committee -- (laughter) -- the super committee --\xc2\xa0 (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The super committee is expected and poised to announce failure today.\xc2\xa0 And without a deal on deficits, $1.2 trillion in cuts are triggered in 2013.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve called those from the podium "onerous" cuts.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Panetta has said that they would be devastating and would create a hollow force.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House reaction to this failure, congressional failure?\xc2\xa0 And given the dire consequences, why did the White House not become more engaged kind of to the degree that the President did with Speaker Boehner back in the summer?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, Jim, I will wait for members of that committee to make an announcement as to their success or failure.\xc2\xa0 To the end of your question, the President of the United States, as you noted, throughout the summer was engaged directly and personally in extensive negotiations with Congress, with the Speaker of the House, on what would have been a broad and balanced and substantial proposal to reduce our deficit and debts over the long term.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President also was engaged, as you know, with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd those efforts, unfortunately, despite the willingness of the President to take extraordinary steps and to bring his party along with him in their willingness to go along with the kind of balanced approach that he felt was necessary and right for the country, in the end Republicans walked away from that deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, at the beginning of the process, at the beginning of the super committee process, a committee established by an act of Congress, put forward a comprehensive proposal that went well beyond the $1.2 trillion mandated by that act and was a balanced approach to deficit reduction and getting our long-term debt under control.\xc2\xa0 That has been available to the committee since it first started meeting, and is available today, with the waning hours left to it to act, as a road map to how you achieve the kind of balanced approach that Americans demand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis committee was established by an act of Congress.\xc2\xa0 It was comprised of members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Instead of pointing fingers and playing the blame game, Congress should act, fulfill its responsibility.\xc2\xa0 As for the sequester, it was designed, again, in this act of Congress, voted on by members of both parties and signed into law by this President, specifically to be onerous, to hold Congress\'s feet to the fire.\xc2\xa0 It was designed so that it never came to pass, because Congress, understanding the consequences of failure, understanding the consequences of inaction, the consequences of being unwilling to take a balanced approach, were so dire.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, let me just say that Congress still has it within its capacity to be responsible and act.\xc2\xa0 As you noted, the sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take effect for a year.\xc2\xa0 Congress could still act and has plenty of time to act.\xc2\xa0 And we call on Congress to fulfill its responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does the President agree, first, with Secretary Panetta that it would hollow out our military?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We made no -- we made clear that the cuts in the sequester are not the best approach to achieving the kind of deficit reduction that we need, and that the defense cuts are much deeper than we think are wise, as Secretary Panetta and the President and others have made clear -- which is why Congress needs to fulfill its responsibility.\xc2\xa0 It needs to hold itself to account, and also, should not then try to undo the consequences of their own failure, the consequences that they themselves passed into law.\xc2\xa0 They should do the right thing and come together.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s important to remember, however, that because of the Budget Control Act, the $1.2 trillion that the super committee was supposed to achieve in deficit reduction will happen regardless.\xc2\xa0 That was the purpose of the law.\xc2\xa0 It\'s Congress\'s responsibility to achieve that in the right way and a better way and a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And again, the President has weighed in in great detail with what he thinks is the right approach -- an approach that\'s supported overwhelmingly by the American people; overwhelmingly, not just by Democrats and independents, but by Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd unfortunately, we\'ve come to a point where -- and it really is -- there\'s a lot of complexity that is loaded on to this process unnecessarily.\xc2\xa0 In the end, it comes down to a decision by Republicans that they are unwilling to do what the American people say they believe should be done, which is ask the very wealthiest Americans, millionaires and billionaires, to pay a little bit extra so that we can achieve the kind of deficit reduction and long-term debt control that we need.\xc2\xa0 Short of that willingness, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how we get to an answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the responsibility ultimately lies with Republicans who you don\xe2\x80\x99t think are able to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that, as everyone can see, from where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this process, the bipartisan proposals put forward by the Rivlin-Domenici Commission, by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, by the President -- the proposals he worked on with the Speaker of the House and the proposal he put forward for everyone to see in September -- requires -- everyone who looks at this responsibly says you have to do in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 You have to have revenue, as well as discretionary cuts, as well as defense cuts, as well as entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 The President has always approached this in that balanced way.\xc2\xa0 Bipartisan commissions have approached it in the balanced way that the President has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, Republicans in the Congress have not approached it in a balanced way that is really the only way to get this done that\xe2\x80\x99s fair.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise, as we saw from the Ryan budget, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a balanced way, if you protect the wealthiest Americans from having to pay their fair share -- not just protect them from having to pay more, but actually, in many cases, give them more tax cuts -- then the burden falls on senior citizens, who see their Medicare bills skyrocket, and then families with children who are disabled and others who are vulnerable in our society.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the alternative if you don\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject -- Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Bloody, deadly rioting there.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a message for the Supreme Council there?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been fairly vague as to when they might hold presidential elections, which is part of the cause behind the rioting in the streets.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are deeply concerned about the violence that has led to a tragic loss of life over the weekend in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And we call for restraint on all sides, so that Egyptians can move forward together to forge a strong and united Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe don\xe2\x80\x99t -- as this process moves forward and as the Egyptian people shape their future, the United States continues to believe that the tragic events -- that these tragic events, rather, should not stand in the way of elections and a continued transition to democracy that is timely, peaceful, just and inclusive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to step back and remember how far Egypt has traveled this year.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important that Egypt continues to move to make that transition to the democracy that the people of Egypt demanded, and as a result of their demands, they ended a multi-decade dictatorship.\xc2\xa0 So we urge, again, restraint on all sides and for the process towards the transition to continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should the generals specify when those presidential elections --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to dictate specifics to Egypt, but we do believe that the process needs to move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President had spoken to the new Italian Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 Europe\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis plus expectations of a failure by the super committee are driving the markets down very sharply today.\xc2\xa0 What if anything can the President do to reassure the markets that the U.S. -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s putting the U.S. on a path to fiscal soundness?\xc2\xa0 And is the President satisfied with the speed at which the European leaders are now tackling their debt crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the first point, I\xe2\x80\x99ll briefly reiterate what I said to Jim, which is that the President put forward a comprehensive plan.\xc2\xa0 He believes Congress could take up that -- the committee could take up that plan and pass it out with its remaining hours if that kind of compromise were something that all sides would want.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is important to remember in terms of the deficit reduction that is embedded within the Budget Control Act that that will go forward, that the $1.2 trillion as a minimum will happen as prescribed by law.\xc2\xa0 Again, not in the way that we want; not in the way that Congress should want -- which is why Congress should take the opportunity to act and deal with this in a balanced way, in a fair way, in a responsible way.\xc2\xa0 But the deficit reduction will happen regardless.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Europe, we remain in a position where we are urging Europe to rapidly implement the proposals that they put forward, the plan that they put forward.\xc2\xa0 They need to -- they have the capacity to act, as you know.\xc2\xa0 They have the resources to act, and we continue to urge them to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past, the President has said that the Europeans are not acting as quickly and as aggressively as they need to to deal with the situation and prevent the headwinds from hitting the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And are they acting fast enough and aggressively enough now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think by making it clear that we believe they need to move forward on rapid, decisive implementation, that we believe that rapidity and decisiveness is needed here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have new governments in place in Italy, Greece, and now Spain, and that makes it even more critical that Europe move forward with that implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo their credit, the Europeans laid a foundation for acting and they have all the elements they need for success here to create an enhanced rescue facility, to strengthen European banks, to chart a sustainable path for Greece, and to confront the structural issues that are at the heart of the current crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, Matt, with the President and Tim Geithner -- Secretary of Treasury -- and others have been very engaged with their European counterparts on this issue, offering advice because we have a certain amount of experience in dealing with this kind of crisis.\xc2\xa0 And we urge them to move forward rapidly.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to get some reaction from the White House about the information networks in Lebanon and Iran that have been discovered.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if there will be a demand for accountability, a review of CIA procedures, and how much the White House is concerned that this will affect the attempts to monitor Iran\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to get a nuclear weapon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on intelligence matters from here, Jake, so maybe if you have a more specific question on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that is making news all over the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a secret anymore.\xc2\xa0 There has been a -- I assume you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\xc2\xa0 Is there no reaction from the White House at all?\xc2\xa0 Is there no concern that this information network has been discovered and there\xe2\x80\x99s people who are serving from the United States -- may have even been executed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a matter of information networks regarding intelligence.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Iranian behavior in general, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to comment on that, but not on that specific.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you care to comment on Iranian behavior in general?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Iranians are -- the Iranian regime is isolated for a reason; because of its constant flouting of its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And the interests that we have undertaken to further isolate Iran with our international partners we believe will continue to pressure the regime and drive it to the conclusion that it needs to get right with the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Iranian misbehavior is certainly not a new thing or a new problem.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with our partners to deal with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on some of those super committee questions.\xc2\xa0 When asked about the fact that the White House took a hands-off approach, you said that the White House did not take a hands-off approach throughout the summer.\xc2\xa0 So the decision to take a hands-off approach this time, was that because the previous attempts failed and the President wanted to see how it would work without him playing a role?\xc2\xa0 Could you explain the decision-making process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I disagree --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A direct role in negotiating.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, in the summer, the President, as President, had to deal with a potential disaster that would have befallen this country and the global economy had those who seemed determined to push this process over the edge by allowing us to default on our obligations succeeded. So there was an urgency at the time that required his direct involvement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me now argue with the premise, which is that he\'s been disengaged.\xc2\xa0 That is simply false.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, but the premise is that he has been less engaged.\xc2\xa0 What happened --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was in Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one assumes he was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The super committee has been in existence now for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And at the beginning of the process -- now, remember, during the summer there were lots of calls for, where is the President\'s plan?\xc2\xa0 Where is his ideas on paper?\xc2\xa0 Where are they?\xc2\xa0 And as you know, now, we were involved in intensive negotiations -- the President was -- with the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 And by design, and by request by the parties to those negotiations, the process was kept relatively quiet and paper was not made public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was a hope that that process would lead to the grand bargain; that the Speaker would reach an agreement in which balance was achieved, that revenues were included, and some tough decisions on entitlement reforms were also included.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the beginning of this process, the committee created by Congress, the President, preemptively if you will, put forward his ideas, his plans, in detail.\xc2\xa0 And those have been available. It\'s never been a mystery for the members of the committee what the President thinks or what his preferences are in this process. What we have seen, unfortunately, is that very early on in the process, I believe it was the Speaker who announced that revenue was off the table, basically declaring that the vast majority of the American people, their ideas for how this should be done were irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we know that that\'s not what happened, that Senator Toomey did make an offer and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right -- well, there was an offer, as we\'ve seen reported, that involved some revenues while it then provided even additional tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it wasn\'t the kind of balanced plan that the public supports, the President called for, the bipartisan commissions both demanded, and that, ultimately, is the only way that we can get to the kind of sweeping deficit reduction and debt control that we need.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we made clear from the beginning what the President\'s position was.\xc2\xa0 The committee was established by an act of Congress, with members on the committee who are all legislators in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And what their mandate was was quite clear, and the path to a compromise was always quite clear.\xc2\xa0 But there had to be willingness on both sides -- there has to be willingness on both sides to want the kind of balance that the American people demand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President did make a decision to not be as involved in this as you had been in the summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\'re entirely different circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\'t disagree that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having one-on-one conversations with the Speaker of the House here in the White House on this.\xc2\xa0 But we were in a different place.\xc2\xa0 That was working out an approach with the Speaker that then became very well known to the public, the willingness of this President to make tough decisions, do hard things for Democrats, his commitment to bringing Democrats along in that process.\xc2\xa0 And what his position then became I think has been clear to everyone since then.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that we agree on the premise, was that a mistake?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Was it a mistake that the President put forward a detailed comprehensive proposal?\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it a mistake for him not to have been as involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For him to have been as involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He has been, from the beginning of this process, directly engaged in it, providing ideas, proposals, specifics.\xc2\xa0 And what the Congress needs to do to get this done is apparent to everyone who writes about this, who reports on it for television, who pays attention at all.\xc2\xa0 And there is just a remarkable unwillingness among Republicans, unfortunately, to accept the fact that the only way to get from here to there is to do it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the only fair way to do it.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that Congress will eventually act accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tJessica, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to move in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First on Iran.\xc2\xa0 The U.K. today has announced they\'re sanctioning the Central Bank, but the U.S. is not following suit or sanctioning -- this is in the wake of the IAEA report.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re sanctioning -- the U.S. is sanctioning some companies, but not the Central Bank.\xc2\xa0 Why has the U.S. made this decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we are, as we said we would do, increasing sanctions, ratcheting up pressure on Iran, and we continue to look at all options going forward.\xc2\xa0 So we are in this place with Iran, the isolation that it feels and the pressure that it feels, because of leadership from here, by this President and this administration, working unilaterally and together with our partners and allies around the globe, including the UK.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo -- and specifically with regards to the Central Bank, we continue to look at all options and will consult with Congress on that.\xc2\xa0 But you should be clear about the actions that we are taking and that we have taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So sanctioning the Central Bank remains an option?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everything is always on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the super committee, the President in the past has said that he has -- does not regret not taking Simpson-Bowles to the American people.\xc2\xa0 But given what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at today, is it not clear that that was not his best shot at getting some sort of debt reduction plan through Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s a question and not a statement of what you believe -- because here we are in a position where I believe the last proposal put forward by a leader in the House was the $3 billion in revenue.\xc2\xa0 And a suggestion that revenue twice the size of what the President put forward would somehow be agreeable to Republicans, I find pretty interesting.\xc2\xa0 And twice the defense cuts, too.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Simpson-Bowles called for.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 And the approach that Simpson-Bowles took is one that the President adopted.\xc2\xa0 Many provisions of Simpson-Bowles are reflected in the positions he took over the summer and in the plan that he put forward in September.\xc2\xa0 But the idea that somehow, if we just put a different name on it, Republicans in Congress will be willing to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prior to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are some who are saying they should vote on it now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be realistic about what Simpson-Bowles calls for in terms of the extent of revenue and the extent of defense cuts, as well as many other provisions.\xc2\xa0 The overall approach that Simpson-Bowles took in the commission the President set up is one that he has adopted and his proposals mirror quite closely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there less acrimony in Washington at that time, and it was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you really think so?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prior to the debt commission -- prior to the debt deal, the debt talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I suppose everybody\xe2\x80\x99s memories are a little gauzy about golden eras that existed in the past, but not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- starting the conversation earlier than --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that Republicans in Congress are suddenly now willing to embrace the kind of broad, balanced approach, and would vote for a broad, balanced approach -- which, again, is what the President has put forward -- I think that would be great and welcome news.\xc2\xa0 There has not been evidence of that all year long, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any way in which the White House takes any responsibility for the failure of these debt negotiations to go anywhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congress assigned itself a task, wrote a law, voted for it; the President signed it.\xc2\xa0 They have to hold themselves accountable.\xc2\xa0 They have to do the things that American families do every day, which is live within their means and take responsibility for their own actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\'s a committee that they established that was assigned a task that, again, isn\'t all that complicated and isn\'t all that difficult if there\'s a willingness to compromise.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to urge Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity here for Congress to act going forward, and to deal with these problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me go in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, German press.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I was also traveling, just the other direction.\xc2\xa0 I was a week in Germany, and from there, the default and the financial state of the international health looking different.\xc2\xa0 So people are really amazed how this country -- I know it\'s not the government; you have a democracy, but first and foremost, it\'s the parliamentary responsibility, not government responsibility -- how this country deals with the debt crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S., as far as I know, has a worse debt-to-GDP ratio than the whole eurozone, and we are talking about the eurozone, not about the United States and that Congress can\'t get its act together.\xc2\xa0 So from the European perspective, it seems that this country is in a bigger mess than Europe.\xc2\xa0 We are not proud where we are.\xc2\xa0 We know that it\'s slow and not bold, and so on, but at least they are doing something; they are deciding something, they\'re trying to pull that through.\xc2\xa0 And here, nothing is happening -- third time this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s helpful to get into which side of the Atlantic handles its problems better or worse.\xc2\xa0 I think each side needs to -- we need to act and the Congress needs to act, this country needs to act.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, as I just discussed in answer to a question earlier, the Europeans need to move forward with rapid implementation of their plans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is an urgent need in Europe to establish an enhanced firewall and to control this crisis.\xc2\xa0 And there is the capacity in Europe to do it.\xc2\xa0 There is certainly the capacity here and the road map here for what Congress needs to do.\xc2\xa0 And as I\'ve been discussing now in answer to these earlier questions, we hope that Congress will move forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat remains true, because of the Budget Control Act that both parties voted for and the President signed into law, is that an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction remains the law and will happen.\xc2\xa0 It should not happen the way that -- through the sequester.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the optimum outcome, by any means.\xc2\xa0 That was the design, purposefully.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s still the law, and that deficit reduction can and should happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe urge Congress to do it in a balanced way, and to do it in the way the President did, which was to do it -- to go much further than the $1.2 trillion.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s proposal, if you combine it with the savings and discretionary spending through the Budget Control Act, is $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the kind of approach that, again, if the committee and Congress took his proposals, passed them now, and the President signed them into law, would have enormously positive effects on the American economy and the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have just one question.\xc2\xa0 Do you have understanding -- the feeling in the eurozone, I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a time where the U.S. is in a position to give advice to Europe --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t --there\'s no benefit in -- I think we\'ve been clear about our view on Europe\'s capacity and what it needs to do.\xc2\xa0 We worked very closely with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy and others in Europe on this.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, as I just said, spoke with the new Prime Minister of Italy, and we continue to work on those issues and to offer our counsel and advice.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously are very focused on the issues we have here at home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s obvious, from the question, we live now in a borderless global economy.\xc2\xa0 Has the President made any attempt to reach some of the leaders in the eurozone, or have any of them made an attempt to reach the President, over this latest issue of the super committee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just read out to you a call the President made to the new Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any discussions he\'s having about the super committee with European leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said three times that the $1.2 trillion in cuts will happen.\xc2\xa0 What makes you so sure that there aren\'t enough people in Congress even to override a veto?\xc2\xa0 They\'re already talking about changing the balance of the cuts so that they don\'t so deeply affect defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people expect Congress to be accountable and to abide by the law that they passed.\xc2\xa0 And we -- I think that it\'s pretty clear that we don\'t support rewriting that provision or making changes to it.\xc2\xa0 It was designed with a specific purpose in mind, which was to hold Congress\'s feet to the fire, which is what everybody said at the time would be the effect of the provision.\xc2\xa0 And that remains the case going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Murray was here earlier today for the bill signing.\xc2\xa0 Did the President pull her aside and try and take the temperature of the super committee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President spoke with Senator Murray as well as Congressman Hensarling at the beginning of his trip to the Asia Pacific region, and urged them to work diligently to reach a compromise.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was before they had reached an impasse.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not aware of any conversation that the President had with Senator Murray along those lines today.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not ruling it out.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just not aware that he did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear what our position is.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the problem here isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lack of presidential proposals.\xc2\xa0 That proposal -- I meant to bring out my prop again, which is the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive, detailed and lengthy proposal for getting our deficit and debt under control.</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Murray knows that proposal well, as does every member of Congress, certainly every member of the super committee -- although some members of the media occasionally forget that it\xe2\x80\x99s out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Congress needs to do here has been and remains very clear.\xc2\xa0 They need to do their job.\xc2\xa0 They need to fulfill the responsibilities that they set for themselves.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s one way out of this, which is a willingness to take a balanced approach, the approach that Americans of every political persuasion support.\xc2\xa0 If they do that, we can get something done significantly -- something significant done for this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iran, Senator Mark Kirk has an amendment that he says would effectively collapse Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Central Bank, basically blacklisting dealings with countries that do business with Iran. Why is that a bad idea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think I got this question or a variation of it from Jessica.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to Iran, we have leveled already unprecedented levels of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We have, both unilaterally and working with our partners around the world.\xc2\xa0 We continue to look for ways to add to the pressure that Iran feels. And with regards to the specific question of the Central Bank, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to look at all options.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is an ongoing effort that, again, has isolated Iran to a degree that has never before been the case, that is having a direct effect on the Iranian economy, as Iranian leaders have conceded, and that we will continue in order to pressure the Iranian regime to get right with the world, to live up to its international obligations and to deal with the fact that the international community is united in its assessment of Iranian behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happened since the IAEA report came out.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a vote by the Board of Governors that was overwhelmingly in favor of pressuring Iran and criticizing Iran for its behavior.\xc2\xa0 Then we had a vote in the United Nations General Assembly about the Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States -- again, overwhelming support, including from Arab nations condemning that behavior.\xc2\xa0 Iran has never been this isolated.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to put the pressure on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying its not yet time to put the kind of pressure on Iran that Senator Kirk is talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- that we did not take options off the table.\xc2\xa0 And with regard to the specific one that you mentioned, we continue to look at options and consult with Congress, including those who have a particular interest in the subject.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, fellow traveler.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House that this super committee standoff could lead to another credit rating downgrade, and has the White House been in touch with the credit rating agencies to try to avert that from happening?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any contact.\xc2\xa0 I just know one way or the other the -- I\'ll just go back to something I said earlier about the Budget Control Act made law a level of deficit -- further deficit reduction that either the committee would achieve or would happen through the sequester.\xc2\xa0 That has not changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is unfortunate if predictions of the super committee\xe2\x80\x99s failure prove true, but the law has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And the Congress still has within its power the ability to act, to do the right thing, to take up a balanced approach to have Democrats and Republicans vote for it, and to get it to the White House so he can sign it into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the way the downgrade happened before was so messy with this last-minute back-and-forth with the Treasury.\xc2\xa0 Is there some interest in starting a dialogue early so that that doesn\'t happen again?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you might want to ask Treasury if they\xe2\x80\x99ve had any of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some that are pointing out that if Congress and the President don\'t do another thing through 2013, that they, by default, landed in the big deal, in the sense that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already done a trillion -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve got $1.2 trillion of sequestration that kicks in, and if the Bush tax cuts expire, as they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to at the end of 2012, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got revenues going up maybe $5 trillion.\xc2\xa0 So if the President and Congress don\'t do another thing, the Bush tax cuts expire, the sequestration kicks in -- is that a level of balance?\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re up to about $7 trillion in deficit reduction right there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just make this point on the sequester -- that is not the preferred option here.\xc2\xa0 The sequester was designed to be onerous and undesirable, and it remains our view that that is not the way to go, because Congress needs to do this in a responsible way -- not abdicate its responsibility, not refuse to -- and alternatively, not refuse to accept the consequences of its inability to compromise, but refocus their efforts on finding a solution here.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe position of the President is well known on the kind of approach that we need to take.\xc2\xa0 It happens to reflect the position that most Americans believe is the right way to go.\xc2\xa0 And what happens next year, there are too many variables for me to get into predicting.\xc2\xa0 But what we know now is that Congress has all the incentive, as well as the desire of the American people behind moving towards compromise.\xc2\xa0 So we would hope that Congress would do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I just want to get at the idea of balance.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about balance in another way.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the approach to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you mean?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When we talk about balance -- I mean, one of the things that -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here -- because what\xe2\x80\x99s lacking in terms of balance in some of the other proposals we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen or some of the proposals we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Republicans is any effort to ask the wealthiest Americans -- Americans, who, by reports we\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen, have done extraordinarily well over the last decade, the last three decades, as middle-class families have seen their income stagnate or decline -- asking them to just pay a little bit more, so that all of the pressure, all of the burden is not borne by the middle class, by seniors, by parents of disabled children.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo revenue is an essential part of balance.\xc2\xa0 Entitlement reform is a part of balance.\xc2\xa0 Discretionary cuts are a part of balance.\xc2\xa0 And defense cuts are a part of balance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, you need to do this is in a responsible way so that you make -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re making your cuts, you\xe2\x80\x99re making choices that allow -- that are the least painful and that allow the economy to grow.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why the President is so committed to investments in education and innovation is because those are so essential for our future economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the kinds of blind across-the-board cuts that might occur through the sequester can be harmful, in the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing, to our national security budget.\xc2\xa0 The preferred approach is one that\xe2\x80\x99s done eyes wide open, where decisions are made, tough choices are made, and they\xe2\x80\x99re done -- and they\xe2\x80\x99re made in the spirit of compromise and in the spirit of taking a balanced approach, so that everybody shares in the prosperity and everybody bears some of the burden.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick question.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to pursue the extension of unemployment at the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a key element of the American Jobs Act, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would he support having it paid for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, as you know, is very clear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s paid for in the way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing, as are all the provisions of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 We certainly expect the Senate to put forward a proposal on the payroll tax cut and the extension of UI that reflects those principles.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Turning to Syria, Secretary Clinton said last week that there could be a civil war with a very determined and well-armed and eventually well-financed opposition.\xc2\xa0 And in reaction to that, the Syrian foreign minister said that those comments were really wishful thinking.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration stand by those comments by Secretary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comments are accurate in terms of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing happen in Syria.\xc2\xa0 What is clear is that President Assad has lost his legitimacy to lead. He has taken brutal action against his own people.\xc2\xa0 And we call on that regime to cease the kinds of violent acts that we continue to see against innocent Syrians.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing broad isolation of Syria because of that behavior of the regime, and our position has not changed on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the administration consider reaching out to the opposition if you thought that it had crossed into civil war, as we did in Libya, for example?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s getting ahead of the matter.\xc2\xa0 Our position is that the violence has to stop and Assad has lost his legitimacy to lead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama heads to New Hampshire tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Given the political importance of this state, is this a sign that the President is sort of officially wading into the 2012 waters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confidently -- I can predict with all confidence that the President will win the New Hampshire primary in the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And beyond that -- no.\xc2\xa0 He travels all over the country, to different parts of the country, to speak about his ideas for getting this economy growing again. I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very significant that tomorrow he is going to New Hampshire to talk specifically about the need to extend and expand the payroll tax cut, a tax cut that would go to every working American family, and -- in answer to an earlier question -- that he believes should be paid for by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit extra.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also -- his proposal also includes a payroll tax cut for businesses.\xc2\xa0 And these are the kinds of measures that -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important just to -- the existing payroll tax cut, the one that was put into law last December, almost a year ago, and that has been in place this whole year, by independent economists\' analysis added at least a half a percent and maybe as much as 1 percent to gross domestic product this year, to GDP, to the growth of this economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need to ensure that that is in place for next year because Americans are struggling and they deserve this tax break. And we certainly would be shocked if Congress did not go along, if Republicans, as some have said, did not support a tax cut for working Americans.\xc2\xa0 To not support that, but then to demand protecting tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, and even extending them, is, to me, I would think an untenable position politically, even if it doesn\'t weigh on your conscience.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify two things.\xc2\xa0 One, why does the White House think the super committee failed?\xc2\xa0 And the second is you said that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President wants to pay for the payroll tax cut extension through raising taxes on millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 Is that specifically what he supports?\xc2\xa0 Or do you mean that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that Senator Reid had put forward before?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what makes you guys think that that\'s going to pass Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the whole American Jobs Act, including the payroll tax cut extension and expansion, is paid for that way, through revenues drawn from asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little extra.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, in terms of what -- now that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99re not voting on the entire American Jobs Act but elements of it, and the Senate has -- Senate Democrats have put forward these provisions and paid for them so far by asking for a little extra from millionaires and billionaires, and if they -- that would be an approach that this President supports because it meets the principles that guided him when he designed the American Jobs Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the super committee, if, in fact, predictions of its demise prove true, I think there was a -- there has been in the end an unwillingness to -- by Republicans to go along with the kind of balanced approach that not just this President, not just Democrats, but independents and Republicans out in the country believe is the right way to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tI certainly hope that Republicans in the future or going forward now would entertain the idea of taking that balanced approach, again the approach that was embodied in the Simpson-Bowles Commission report, embodied in the Rivlin-Domenici proposal and embodies in the negotiations that the Speaker of the House and the President engaged in this summer, embodied again in the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal in September.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many ways to skin this cat.\xc2\xa0 And the best way is evident and clear to everyone who looks at it, and we hope the Congress would act on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when was the President first briefed on the lone wolf in New York City?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his level of involvement been since then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a law enforcement matter at the local level, so I refer you to local officials on that.\xc2\xa0 The President I\xe2\x80\x99m sure was -- I don\'t know this because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he was made aware of it this morning, if not yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And earlier you referred to the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that you kind of held up I think three times in the last briefing, which was 12 days ago, as a prop.\xc2\xa0 Since the President issued that proposal, in the intervening months since then, what -- can you describe his day-to-day involvement in the actions of the super committee, including during the Pacific trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President called at the beginning of his trip Senator Murray and Congressman Hensarling, discussed the progress of the super committee, urged the two co-chairmen to move forward and try to reach a deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can describe very clearly to you that the President put forward in that proposal -- and I called it a prop because I know you all had reported on it and read it in detail prior to me bringing it out almost two months after it had come forward -- what his ideas were for the committee to adopt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a proposal and two phone calls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this a number of times.\xc2\xa0 The membership of the committee is made up by -- is comprised entirely of members of Congress with a mandate passed into law by Congress, majorities of both parties -- or members of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a seat at that table that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of for a member of the administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we were, all fall, in contact with members of Congress through various liaisons here at the White House, in contact with members of the committee.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about it.\xc2\xa0 Congress assigned itself a job, assigned 12 of its own members a task, a task that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really that difficult to achieve if there was a willingness to compromise, if there was a willingness to take a balanced approach, an approach that is supported by a majority of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tCongress needs to meet its responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to take action.\xc2\xa0 This committee had the opportunity to adopt a proposal that was very balanced.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, because of an unwillingness of one side to do what the American people say is the right thing to do in this case, it looks like they may not achieve that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the proposal --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered this question probably a dozen times over the past couple months.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast one, Roger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The super committee is supposed to announce its results later today.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear from the President after that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling announcements to make at this time.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:36 P.M.
