EST</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, or good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for your patience again.\xc2\xa0 As you can see, communications continues to be a little bit of a challenge.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just part of what we\'re working with every day here to get done what we have done on behalf of the Haitian people and the survivors.</p>\n<p>Today\'s speaker, we have one speaker today so we have a very focused conversation.\xc2\xa0 So, again, anything outside these lanes, we\'d ask that you e-mail to our <a href="mailto:haitijic@usaid.gov">haitijic@usaid.gov</a>, and we\'d be happy to help you through that, and through further teleconferences in the days to come.</p>\n<p>But today our focus is health issues, and our speaker is Captain Andy Stevermer.\xc2\xa0 And Captain Stevermer is the Commander of the Incident Response Coordination Team, National Disaster Medical System.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, I\'ll turn you over to Captain Stevermer.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 This is Captain Andy Stevermer.\xc2\xa0 I\'m a captain with the United States Public Health Service, and I am the Commander of the Incident Response Coordination Team for the Department of Health and Human Services, which means basically that I\'m in charge of all on-the-ground assets here in Haiti for the Department of Health and Human Services in order to provide medical response to this disaster.</p>\n<p>Before I begin my opening comments, I want to first of all just say to everyone, and especially the people of Haiti, that I want to extend my sympathies to all of the Haitian people, who have demonstrated courage, graciousness, and resilience through this overwhelming disaster.</p>\n<p>I have been associated with Haiti for the last 13 years, and I know the people of Haiti.\xc2\xa0 And my heart goes out to them in their struggles and in their losses.</p>\n<p>Now, to my comments about the current international medical response.\xc2\xa0 We are just a part of the international medical response, and we are working as quickly as possible to save lives and to provide immediate medical care here in Haiti.\xc2\xa0 We currently have more than 270 medical personnel in Port-au-Prince, which include doctors, nurses, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, and others.\xc2\xa0 These members work for the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Disaster Medical System.\xc2\xa0 They have taken time out of their daily jobs in the U.S. to come here and to assist with the relief efforts.</p>\n<p>To date, these medical teams have been seeing patients beginning on Sunday, and since that time have seen 5,100 people.\xc2\xa0 We currently have five disaster medical assistance teams and one international medical surgical response team in Port-au-Prince.</p>\n<p>All of the five disaster medical assistance teams are currently engaged treating, triaging, and providing -- conducting surgery for patients.\xc2\xa0 The most common medical problems which are being treated are traumatic injuries from the earthquake and exacerbations of chronic disease caused by lack of access to care and -- lack of access to care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States is increasing its capacity to deliver assistance.\xc2\xa0 And this morning, the USN Comfort, a large hospital ship, arrived from Baltimore with more than 600 medical persons on board, bringing a tremendous capability to the people of Haiti.\xc2\xa0 Already, these patients are being triaged and prepared to board the U.S. Comfort via helicopter and receive the treatment they need.</p>\n<p>One of our disaster medical assistance teams is working as a staging facility at a pier here in Port-au-Prince to triage patients who will then fly by helicopter for treatment aboard the Comfort.\xc2\xa0 Another of our disaster medical assistance teams and our surgical team are currently working on a large soccer field near the GHESKIO clinic here in Port-au-Prince and have been active for the past three days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Additional teams are providing relief for overwhelmed hospitals in Port-au-Prince.\xc2\xa0 This activity is being done at the direction of and in full coordination with the Haitian Ministry of Health, the United States\' Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 We are working together down here to move patients from overwhelmed hospitals and to find beds in other hospitals to provide relief to local facilities.</p>\n<p>Supplies are arriving on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 Two planeloads of medical supplies and medical equipment arrived in Haiti yesterday, and the bulk of which have already been distributed to the sites where care is being provided.\xc2\xa0 In addition, we are providing additional resources.\xc2\xa0 Health and Human Services has provided, through the USAID, a surgical cache of medical equipment and supplies that will be distributed to medical facilities here in Haiti.</p>\n<p>In summary, let me reiterate that we are working as quickly as possible to meet the tremendous medical needs here in Haiti.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Captain Stevermer, and we will take questions here in just a second.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just remind you again that Mr. Tim Callaghan, from USAID, who was here yesterday, he will return tomorrow for broader questions on the broader support that USAID is providing.\xc2\xa0 But we now welcome questions on health issues to Captain Stevermer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much for taking the call and for the work that you\'re doing down there.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you can talk -- I understand about the Comfort and everything that you\'re setting up.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak at all about the lack of medical supplies for other doctors on the ground?\xc2\xa0 It seems that a lot of our teams on the ground are reporting that a lot of doctors do not have the supply -- there is no dearth of doctors and people that want to do good work, but that they\'re not getting the medical supplies that they need to get the job done, and if you have any thoughts or any information on why that doesn\'t seem to be happening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\'m not sure if you\'re able to talk about this specifically, but Doctors Without Borders has reported that their plane was diverted five times for their urgently needed supplies to get on the ground, if you have any information on that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Let me be -- start by saying medical supplies are critical to our efforts -- our successful efforts here with providing health care, and getting these supplies into theater in a timely fashion is incredibly important.</p>\n<p>The efforts of supplying all of the various medical providers is being conducted through the World Health Organization, who is coordinating all international donors of pharmaceuticals and consumable medical supplies into a single system run by the Haitian Ministry of Health, known as PROMESS, which are then being distributed out to the responders as well as to the existing hospitals here in Haiti.</p>\n<p>This system is getting better every day in its warehouses and its supplies and its ability to distribute these sites to the many, many providers who are in this theater of operations.\xc2\xa0 We are working closely with the Haitian government to identify unmet needs and to address those needs.</p>\n<p>As for the second part of your question, I do not control the planes coming in and out of the airport here in Port-au-Prince.\xc2\xa0 We have a single airport, which has been damaged from the earthquake.\xc2\xa0 It is under the control of the U.S. military, and we are working very hard to increase its capability to bring necessary supplies to the people of Haiti who need them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you a question about the Comfort.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a ship -- correct me if I\'m wrong -- it has 12 operating rooms, about a capacity for about 1,000 beds.\xc2\xa0 How many people do you expect to be treating on this ship, and how many have you already moved out there?</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 The Comfort has arrived in port and is preparing to and very soon to begin seeing patients.</p>\n<p>The volume of patients to be seen is the prerogative of the Department of Defense who run that resource.\xc2\xa0 We will use that resource to the maximum capability that is necessary to support the needs here in Haiti.</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I would like to add, as the moderator, we invited and hope before the end of the call to have a representative from the Comfort.\xc2\xa0 If that doesn\'t occur today we\'ll certainly pursue for greater detail tomorrow or the next day with that specific sub-topic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually I have two quick ones, if I can.\xc2\xa0 One is, can you give some sense of the need for -- the number of injured, the need for care, and the (inaudible) supply if you -- of course, it\'s better now the Comfort (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 And the second one is, can you comment on this morning\'s aftershocks?\xc2\xa0 Have we seen (inaudible) as a result of that affected operations at all?\xc2\xa0 So two questions, one having to do with (inaudible) and the other (inaudible)?</p>\n<p>MR. STOVEKING:\xc2\xa0 I think we hear the question.\xc2\xa0 I apologize, caller, you were a little bit hard to hear.\xc2\xa0 But I think you\'re asking the total numbers injured and if there is an increase of injuries after today\'s shocks.\xc2\xa0 And with that that we\'ll give it to Captain Stevermer.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 As for the incoming -- the number of people injured is a number that we are attempting to determine.\xc2\xa0 That is being coordinated through a coordinating body with the Haitian Ministry of Health with support from the World Health Organization.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen estimates on the number of injured nor the number of fatalities, and would look to the Ministry of Health to provide those details.</p>\n<p>As for the aftershock, I am unaware of any additional injuries.\xc2\xa0 Our clientele -- our personnel are safe.\xc2\xa0 And I am sure that these types of aftershocks are very disconcerting to those living in Haiti in the aftermath of this disaster.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up on something that you had said about the distribution of the medicine.\xc2\xa0 I\'m a little bit confused.\xc2\xa0 Who is running the operation?\xc2\xa0 Is it the WHO or the Haitian Ministry of Health?\xc2\xa0 And how is that working, because as we know there\'s been a lack of capacity on the Haitian Ministry side?\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m just wondering if that lack of capacity is slowing up the distribution of medical supplies throughout the country?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think it\'s an issue of infrastructure or things like that?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, as I previously stated, the timely need for medical supplies is critical to the success of this mission.\xc2\xa0 The responsibility for coordinating and receiving the donations is currently being done through the World Health Organization.\xc2\xa0 The distribution is being done through the Haitian Ministry of Health, their existing system of essential drugs, know as PROMESS.</p>\n<p>That system, which is being challenged by the demand for these types of supplies, by the large numbers of additional providers who have moved into the area to respond to this disaster, it is getting better every day.\xc2\xa0 The amount of drugs and supplies available is building.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to watch and identify additional needs that might need to be brought to Port-au-Prince.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you, there was -- a few days ago, there was an agreement between the U.S. and Cuba to allow the U.S. to over fly Cuban airspace for medical evacuations.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask if there are U.S. personnel working side by side with Cuban doctors who were either sent after the quake or were already working in Haiti beforehand.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Sir, thank you very much for that question.\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of the flights, the medical evacuation flights over Cuba, nor am I aware of responders working side by side with Cuban physicians.\xc2\xa0 I do know that there are many Cuban physicians that serve in Haiti, so it\'s quite probable that that is going on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up specifically on that issue about the Haitian Ministry of Health.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the -- honestly, I know that there is a great necessity and desire to make sure that the Haitian government is coordinating with you and that they should be in the lead on prioritizing what the needs are in the country.\xc2\xa0 But given the damage to the country -- and I know the Ministry of Health is actually one of the ones that\'s in better shape than others -- do they really have the capacity to distribute aid throughout the country?\xc2\xa0 And given like your sophisticated delivery systems, do they have the capability to do that?\xc2\xa0 Or can it be done more expediently through you, through the U.S. military, or through the U.N.?</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 As the moderator, first, I just want to point out that based on these good questions, though, we\'ll certainly extend an invite in the coming days to both the Haitian government and WHO to give a more full-circle answer.\xc2\xa0 But that being said, let me turn to Captain Stevermer to get his insight.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 We are working with the Haitian Ministry of Health and supporting the Haitian Ministry of Health with personnel to be able to manage the surge of workload that they are experiencing as a result of this disaster.\xc2\xa0 And the activities remain that -- such as distribution -- remain under the control and direction of the Haitian Ministry of Health.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is about people rescued alive.\xc2\xa0 Has anyone been rescued alive since Monday when the two-year-old girl was taken from the rubble?</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of that particular situation, but there are many stories by the search and rescue teams of very heroic rescues of people even this late in the response.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Many of the search and rescue teams do come from the United States, as well as elsewhere in the world, and there are many tales of successful saves that are very touching.</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 And I would just add that, since it hit on rescue, just to bring you up on the latest statistics there.\xc2\xa0 So far there have been 43 individuals rescued from collapsed buildings from the United States search and rescue teams alone, bringing a grand total of 75 rescued today.\xc2\xa0 Those are some historic numbers.\xc2\xa0 Some of the search and rescue folks have informed us that on Sunday, having 12 rescues alone, was a record for one-day rescues.\xc2\xa0 Some rescues have lasted 17 hours; one lasted 24 hours -- both successful.\xc2\xa0 A young baby on the fifth day here rescued successfully, and just yesterday on day seven a Haitian woman who\'d been trapped for seven days without food or water was rescued successfully.</p>\n<p>So the stories of survival and rescue and health success stories continue to grow on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if there are schools open in the Port-au-Prince area, and if so, how the government is handling emergency plans for education?</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 We can only tell you anecdotally from previous reports today, President Pr\xc3\xa9val has said that schools will be reopening soon, under tents, in some cases.\xc2\xa0 So we have heard that.\xc2\xa0 We can share that with you as reported information here because we\'re on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not Captain Stevermer\'s area of expertise.\xc2\xa0 So if you\'d like to forward that question to our <a href="mailto:haitijic@usaid.gov">haitijic@usaid.gov</a> e-mail, we\'ll get it to the right folks who can give you an authoritative answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks for having my question.\xc2\xa0 I just -- we just got a wire, a newswire thing that the U.S. military might send 4,000 more soldiers currently in Europe to Haiti.\xc2\xa0 I just want to know if you can confirm on that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 Certainly cannot speculate or confirm statistics on military.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have a military member in the room as part of that operation.\xc2\xa0 But, operator, if there are any more health-related questions, we have time for one or two more questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We would like to know if you have made any contact with PAHO/WHO since you arrived in the morning, and also if you have the necessary equipment to broadcast and stable Internet connection?</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me begin by just thanking PAHO and the World Health Organization for their leadership in coordinating this multinational response.</p>\n<p>Health and Human Services is working closely with the health cluster, which is being coordinated here in Haiti by the Pan American Health Organization.\xc2\xa0 We have offered our staff to help support those efforts, and currently have an individual working directly with PAHO staff to do assessments of hospitals and clinics.\xc2\xa0 In addition, we have several members -- or employees from the Centers for Disease Control who are supporting the PAHO efforts conducting public health assessments and to push forward with the longer-range public health recovery of Port-au-Prince.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To whoever can best answer this, do you have any estimates so far as to how much this has all cost, this health effort has cost, and really how much it will when it\'s all said and done?\xc2\xa0 And if you can\'t give us that, what have you spent so far?</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 I\'m afraid that question also would have to be referred to our <a href="mailto:haitijic@usaid.gov">haitijic@usaid.gov</a> e-mail.\xc2\xa0 We\'d be happy to staff that for you as quick as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question I would put to you is the question that the President of the Association of Haitian Physicians put to me yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He has a list of 250 Haitian medical professionals that are ready to go to Haiti and help.\xc2\xa0 Who can he coordinate with?\xc2\xa0 Should he coordinate directly with the United States or the Haitian government?\xc2\xa0 What he\'s interested in is really sort of these people could travel to Haiti as soon as possible and participate in the relief effort.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN STEVERMER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 That is greatly appreciated, and coordination of those health professionals needs to be done through the Pan American Health Organization, PAHO, to best utilize their expertise and cultural knowledge and linguistic knowledge here in Port-au-Prince.</p>\n<p>I want to close here by just saying, first of all, that we are making progress, and that we are working very hard and as quickly as possible to bring health care to Haiti and the victims of this overwhelming tragedy here.</p>\n<p>We will continue to push forward in our provision of care, as directed by the Haitian Ministry of Health, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Haiti that have been impacted by this disaster.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>MR. STONEKING:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And we\'d just like to thank everybody for continuing to call in and show an interest as we recover and focus on life-saving and life-sustaining events here in Haiti.\xc2\xa0 I ask you again, if you have questions between conference calls, e-mail them to <a href="mailto:haitijic@usaid.gov">haitijic@usaid.gov</a>, and your questions today and throughout help us prepare for future briefings with the right speakers to answer those questions that are of importance to you and the public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And thank you with that, and have a good afternoon.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:40 P.M.
