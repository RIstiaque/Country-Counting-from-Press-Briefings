EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We ready?\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I would like to read to you an excerpt from the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech that he will deliver today in Texas.\xc2\xa0 This is just an excerpt:</p>\n<p>\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday, the Republican Majority Leader in Congress, Eric Cantor, said that right now he won\xe2\x80\x99t even let the jobs bill have a vote in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 He won\xe2\x80\x99t even give it a vote.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like Mr. Cantor to come down here to Dallas and explain what in this jobs bill he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in.\xc2\xa0 Does he not believe in rebuilding America\xe2\x80\x99s roads and bridges?\xc2\xa0 Does he not believe in tax breaks for small businesses or efforts to help veterans?\xc2\xa0 Mr. Cantor should come down to Dallas, look Kim Russell in the eye, and tell her why she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to get a paycheck again.\xc2\xa0 Come tell her students why they don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to have their teacher back.</p>\n<p>\n\tCome tell Dallas construction workers why they should be sitting home instead of fixing our bridges and our schools.\xc2\xa0 Come tell the small business owners and workers in this community why you\xe2\x80\x99d rather defend tax breaks for millionaires than tax cuts for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you won\xe2\x80\x99t do that, at least put this jobs bill up for a vote so that the entire country knows exactly where every member of Congress stands.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s from the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today where he will focus on teacher layoffs and what the American Jobs Act does to put up to 280,000 teachers who have been laid off back to work and up to 400,000 total teachers to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Cantor said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the entire bill would go up for a vote on the floor, but he did say that he thought individual components would go up for a vote.\xc2\xa0 And the Republicans have put out lists of things in the bill that they do support.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t it disingenuous for the President to keep saying that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t told him what they support when they have?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying here.\xc2\xa0 First of all, what is Mr. Cantor afraid of?\xc2\xa0 Why not put it up for a vote and show where he stands and where other members of Congress stand?\xc2\xa0 If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support -- as apparently he does not -- if he does not support putting teachers back to work, demonstrate that through your -- through his vote.\xc2\xa0 If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support putting construction workers back to work, show the American people that fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I have said repeatedly -- and the President himself has said -- if Congress, having voted on the entire American Jobs Act, then sends him portions of it or sections of it piece by piece, he will sign those if they are paid for in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible and balanced, and then ask where the rest is.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- the criticism that this is all or nothing is disingenuous.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a red herring.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s false.\xc2\xa0 Every section of this American Jobs Act is worthy and has this President\xe2\x80\x99s full support.\xc2\xa0 All of it is worthy.\xc2\xa0 And the point the President is making is simply that if Congressman Cantor or others in Congress, Republicans, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we should be doing something now to put teachers back to work, that we should be doing something now to put construction workers back to work, that we should be doing something now to incentivize small businesses to hire veterans -- say so.\xc2\xa0 Vote -- vote accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t hide behind letters you send to the President.\xc2\xa0 Just tell us where you are.\xc2\xa0 Tell us where you stand on those issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if there are things that they are supportive of that are in the jobs act, well, good, let\xe2\x80\x99s get those done.\xc2\xa0 But first of all, the Senate and the House should vote on the entire bill and explain why, if they oppose it, why they oppose it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 China says that the Senate currency bill violates WTO and risks a trade war.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new on that beyond what I said yesterday, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously reviewing the bill that\xe2\x80\x99s moved through the Senate or moving through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re always in discussions with Congress about matters like this.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe share the concern of members about the valuation of the Chinese currency and the need to appreciate the value of the Chinese currency.\xc2\xa0 We also are concerned that any action that might be taken would be effective and consistent with our international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a statement of administration policy before the Senate vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to report to you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to take a position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re restating the same question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 The position I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken is the one I just gave you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the discussions that are taking place with senators about the bill, is it a question of tweaking a bill, or walking away from the bill, or is it \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more than what I just told you about our position on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you say anything about how Kim Russell came to the attention of the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to get that for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, why did you select this particular congressional district?\xc2\xa0 It seems the President is visiting Republican leaders in their home turf.\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the strategy here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know whose district it is.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know we\xe2\x80\x99re in Texas, but -- the irony being that I thought the question was going to be why we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting a state that has a governor running for President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going -- he\xe2\x80\x99s going all over the country.\xc2\xa0 And when we\xe2\x80\x99re in states that are blue states, we get asked, why are we going to blue states.\xc2\xa0 When they\xe2\x80\x99re identified as swing states, we\xe2\x80\x99re asked why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to swing states.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to a state that I guess most folks would say is a red state, why are we going there?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going all over the country taking this message to the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that Governor Perry has adequately addressed the issue of the racial slur on the hunting lease?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what I said yesterday, which is that obviously the word is offensive.\xc2\xa0 And my understanding is that Governor Perry has said, or thinks, the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President regret at all in the interview with Stephanopoulos yesterday saying that the American people aren\xe2\x80\x99t better off now than they were four years ago, given that for a lot of people that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty standard way that they look at elections?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s review the facts.\xc2\xa0 Four years ago was 2007 -- prior to the point where the policies of the previous administration plunged us into the greatest recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 This President ran to restore America from what turned out to be the very low depths created by the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it would be wrong to somehow suggest that the hole created by that recession was not very deep, and that it will not -- that it did not take -- did not happen overnight, the situation that it left us in, and it will -- somehow it will emerge from it overnight.\xc2\xa0 Most Americans understand.\xc2\xa0 In fact, those who don\xe2\x80\x99t think they do are vastly underestimating the American people.\xc2\xa0 Most Americans understand that the recession that this President was confronted with when he took office was devastatingly serious and had, as we know now, the economy contracting at 9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, had the economy shedding over 750,000 jobs the month that he was taking office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is simply a statement of fact that the economy that was -- that existed when this President took office was the worst that this country has experienced since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And it got worse before this President\xe2\x80\x99s policies began to take effect and began making it better.\xc2\xa0 And I think that anybody who writes about this, or broadcasts about this, has a responsibility -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to use mischaracterizations of what the President said should explain the facts along with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the significance of Eastfield College as the site for his visit?\xc2\xa0 Like every other public institution of higher learning in Texas, it has illegal immigrants who are getting in-state tuition discounts -- more than 500 of them.\xc2\xa0 Is this part of an effort to embarrass Governor Perry?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on the location and stuff.\xc2\xa0 I can get that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President make of the fact that so many people in the Republican primary don\xe2\x80\x99t think very highly of this in-state tuition policy, which he supports through the DREAM Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to spend a lot of time talking about intra-Republican politics and the Republican primary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made any calls to EU leaders on the debt crisis over there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today?\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any calls to congressional leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 He may have talked to -- I can check.\xc2\xa0 Not since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you quickly, on this story that we have out today about the President, in his recommendations to the super committee, having this proposal in there that would give debt collectors greater access to people\xe2\x80\x99s cell phones, to make calls to get them to pay student loans or other federal debts that they\xe2\x80\x99re in default on.\xc2\xa0 Why would he include that in a bill at a time when he\xe2\x80\x99s openly acknowledged that so many people have been out of work for so long?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just an acknowledgment of the fact that a lot of people have abandoned landlines and only have cell phones, and as a matter of practicality, if they need to be contacted with regard to their debt, that they -- there has to be a way to contact them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Four fundraisers today -- it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an unusually high number.\xc2\xa0 What does that signify about how much time is being devoted to campaigning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, in August the President -- we had to cancel a number of campaign events.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do those at a certain pace that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s really -- as we did last week -- and it will ebb and flow depending on the period.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the policy on a trip like this, where you do have fundraisers?\xc2\xa0 Does the DNC \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to -- I mean \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- take up some portion of the -- or the campaign pick up some portion \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everything is done entirely by the book, and there are people who manage that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer them to you.\xc2\xa0 I can take that for somebody else in the White House or the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to say anything about Governor Perry at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The only preview I have for you is what I read to you about his remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about certain Democratic elected officials in Missouri who may or may not be in proximity to the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys are obsessing with the minutiae today.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President is carrying a message around the country about the need -- look, the stuff that American people actually care about, which is the sluggish economy:\xc2\xa0 the need for the economy to create jobs; the need to put teachers back to work in the case of -- which will be the focus of his remarks in Dallas -- the need to put construction workers back to work; the need to put money in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets which an extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut would do; the need to help small businesses, which are the engine of economic growth, which a payroll tax cut on the employer side would do.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty confident that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people care about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment about the special election in West Virginia today at all?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some people talking about these special elections as referendums on the presidency.\xc2\xa0 What do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I honestly haven\xe2\x80\x99t read about it, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the poll.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I would point you to the comments I made, however it comes out, that special elections are special, and they\xe2\x80\x99re often not indicative of any greater trend.\xc2\xa0 And I think a good example of that is the fact that the Democrats won -- I think swept the special elections leading up to the 2010 midterms, so -- which is not to say -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that when -- if Democrats lose, like they did in the New York race, that somehow that means anything about -- it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything either way.\xc2\xa0 It tends not to mean anything either way.\xc2\xa0 It can be very specific to the state or district, and the fact that turnout is extremely low, and all the factors that you all know well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Minutiae.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it something you forgot, or what?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just a brief add, and you can ask me about it if you want.\xc2\xa0 You ready?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked about this, but I wanted to note, because it\xe2\x80\x99s related to what we talked about at the top about Congressman Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s view of the American Jobs Act and the suggestion that he is so against certain provisions within it that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to bring it up for a vote.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s proposals and the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 proposals for what -- their supposed job-creating proposals is focused largely on cutting regulation.\xc2\xa0 And I would commend to you -- anyone who has a moment -- an article by Bruce Bartlett, who was a senior policy -- had senior policy roles in both the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, where he decimates the argument that somehow regulation is the problem facing our economy right now, facing -- that\xe2\x80\x99s causing businesses not to hire.\xc2\xa0 It decimates the argument that the kind of deregulatory approach that the Republicans are pushing would have any measurable impact, positive impact, on economic growth or job creation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a fallacy.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also happens to be a recipe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried before, and led to the historically bad economy that this President was confronted with when he took office.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s get serious about the American people\xe2\x80\x99s demand for Washington to take action that affects the economy and jobs now, not proposals that reward special interests, that reward donors, but do little or nothing to affect jobs, certainly in the near term and probably in the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tAny questions?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:45 A.M.
