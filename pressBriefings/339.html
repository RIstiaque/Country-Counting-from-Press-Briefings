Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:15 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the long delay in starting today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do a couple of things at the top and then we\'ll get to your questions.</p>\n<p>As you know, the President is looking very much forward to speaking at the House Democratic Issues Conference this evening in Philadelphia.\xc2\xa0 You can expect him to discuss advancing the middle-class economic proposals from his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we noted this morning, the President will announce that his budget will reverse harmful sequestration cuts, and instead show how we can invest in his vision for middle-class economics by making paychecks go further, creating good jobs here in the United States, and preparing hardworking Americans to earn higher wages.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will also make it clear that Congress needs to pass a full year of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and expressed his support for the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 firm position in holding Republicans responsible for fixing this problem of their own making.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have shirked their responsibility to fund one of the government\xe2\x80\x99s most critical agencies charged with protecting our homeland, securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws, in favor of a political stunt.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s now time for them to put their games aside so the men and women of this agency can focus on their important mission, which is keeping the country safe.</p>\n<p>As Secretary Johnson noted this morning, the Homeland Security budget should not be a political football.\xc2\xa0 As all three former DHS Secretaries, two of whom are Republican, have also written in a letter to lawmakers today, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot emphasize enough that the DHS\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities are much broader than its responsibility to oversee the federal immigration agencies and to protect our borders.\xc2\xa0 And funding for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy by the debate about immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it should be a lively session with the President and House Democrats today.</p>\n<p>One other note about an event later this week.\xc2\xa0 In his State of the Union address last week, the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why, tomorrow, the President will host an event here at the White House that will include patients, researchers, clinicians, and leaders in government and industry to announce details of his new precision medicine initiative.\xc2\xa0 At the event, the President will highlight key investments in his 2016 budget aimed at improving health and treating disease through precision medicine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ll have more information about the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement following today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 So that will be something to look forward to tomorrow.</p>\n<p>So, with all that, Jim, do you want to get started with questions today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple subjects.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with the budget.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you noted, the President is asking for restoring money that had been sequestered to the tune of $74 billion, equally divided between domestic and defense.\xc2\xa0 He says -- the White House says that this will be accomplished by closing loopholes and ending wasteful programs.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could give us some examples. It seems that closing loopholes has been part of different programs offered by the White House, from tax reform to paying for some of your initiatives.\xc2\xa0 So can you tell us which loopholes you\'re isolating for this purpose, what wasteful spending you\'re isolating?\xc2\xa0 And if there is wasteful spending, why not just end wasteful spending, period, and not use it in this particular matter.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, we certainly welcome your questions.\xc2\xa0 It will be much easier to announce on Monday once the President has presented his budget.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, you may not have questions anymore because you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to look at tables themselves.</p>\n<p>But you are right, the President has put forward a variety of ideas about ways that we can make our tax code more fair and more simple, by closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected.\xc2\xa0 The best example of this is a proposal that we rolled out just before the State of the Union, so a little over a week ago, where the President proposed closing the trust fund loophole.\xc2\xa0 This is something that would save the U.S. government more than $200 billion over the next 10 years.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re talking about a sizable recovery of revenue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that goes to the $320 billion that you want to use for both middle-class tax relief, community colleges, and -- so is that all part of that mix?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the point is that -- what we have been clear about, though, is that closing the trust fund loophole and some of the other tax reform proposals that were rolled out before the State of the Union would certainly pay for all of the middle-class tax cuts that the President proposed that would make it easier to save for a college education, that would offer a tax cut to two-earner families to make their -- to make it easier for them to stretch their paycheck -- that all of those proposals would be paid for by the tax reform proposals the President put forward and then some, that there is revenue left over that can go to other priorities.</p>\n<p>And what you will see in the budget when the President presents it on Monday is a series of important investments that will benefit middle-class families, a restructuring of the tax code without deviating from the path of declining deficits that the President has also made a priority -- that over the course of the last five years, we have succeeded in actually reducing the deficit by two-thirds.\xc2\xa0 This is the fastest sustained deficit reduction since World War II.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible -- and, in fact, I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s proved that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible -- for us to make smart decisions with the budget to make our tax code fairer and more simple, and do it all in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fiscally responsible.\xc2\xa0 And you have some very good detailed questions that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to answer on Monday when we present the budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you also noted, this is one for one, half of the spending would be domestic, half would be defense.\xc2\xa0 Assuming that this is kind of the beginning of a negotiating process with Congress, is it fair to assume that -- and knowing that Republicans want to increase defense spending -- that the President will not veto that unless it\xe2\x80\x99s matched equally dollar for dollar for increased domestic spending whatever the final number is?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that certainly is consistent with the kind of agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached in previous budget negotiations over the last several years, and that certainly seems a principled -- it seems worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And factor in those budget negotiations -- and, as you know, the deficit has been going down -- but part of the reason for that is, in addition to perhaps a better economy generating more revenue, tax increases on the wealthiest, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also partly because of sequestration, cut spending.\xc2\xa0 You argue that at the height of -- or during the recovery, that was not a good policy to have.\xc2\xa0 Now you\xe2\x80\x99re arguing that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good policy to have even though you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the economy is strong.\xc2\xa0 When is cutting spending a good policy in order to lead to lower deficits, if not then and if not now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have said, Jim, is that certainly cutting spending makes sense when it\xe2\x80\x99s in the context of not undermining the kinds of programs that are so critical to the success of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy is that our economy is going to be strongest when it\xe2\x80\x99s growing from the middle out, which is why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cutting funding for programs that we know benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in fact, what we have said is that there is a better way -- and the truth is, even looking back, we believe that there is a better way that we could have succeeded in reducing the deficit that would have asked those at the top of the income scale to pay a little bit more, for us to ask the big banks on Wall Street and the large financial firms on Wall Street to pay a little bit more, that that would have been a fairer way for us to reduce the deficit.</p>\n<p>But Republicans had the majority in the House of Representatives and it required us striking some compromises.\xc2\xa0 And even as difficult as it has been to work with Republicans to find agreements on these issues, that reducing spending and the President succeeding over Republican objections to win -- or at least over the objections of the vast majority of Republicans -- to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, a campaign promise that the President made back in 2007, that all of that is a strategy that while it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly the way that we would have scripted up, it\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that has succeeded in reducing our deficit and, as you point out, over the last couple of years we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen some pretty strong economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, what you would also hear me say is that had we followed the strategy that the President advocated, that our economic growth would have been even stronger.\xc2\xa0 But in some ways, those are debates for the past.\xc2\xa0 What we want to talk about now is the future.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that the strategy that the President has laid out -- focusing on middle-class families -- is one that certainly deserves strong bipartisan support in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 It does have strong bipartisan support across the country.</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that the President has some credibility around these issues now; that he inherited a terrible financial crisis -- the worst financial crisis that our economy has sustained since the Great Depression -- and because of some of the -- because of many of the policies that this President put in place, even some policies that were politically unpopular, our economy has come roaring back.\xc2\xa0 And the President is determined to make sure that now that we have laid a strong foundation that we can now ensure the longer-term economic success of this country now that we have bounced back from this crisis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject -- the deadline that Islamic terrorists had set for Jordan releasing a prisoner in exchange for the Jordanian pilot has passed.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any information as to, one, the status of the Jordanian pilot and the circumstances -- current circumstances in that faceoff?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Jim.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Jordanians have indicated that they are engaged in some conversations with ISIL to try to secure the Jordanian pilot.\xc2\xa0 But for any questions about the status of the pilot or the status of those negotiations, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Jordanian government and the Japanese government -- the two governments that are involved in trying to recover their citizens who are being held hostage by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Banking Committee today passed the Menendez-Kirk bill by a big bipartisan vote, 18-4.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys supporting that bill?\xc2\xa0 I know you realize that -- concede that it\xe2\x80\x99s better than what you had before, but are you supporting it? And what does it mean about what happens on March 24th?\xc2\xa0 If circumstances are such, will the President request another delay if negotiations seem to be perceived in a way that you thought was positive, like you have in the past?\xc2\xa0 Or is March 24th a hard and fast bright-line deadline for you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I can just say as a general matter that we are pleased that Democrats have put forward a statement indicating that they would hold off their support for legislation that would impose additional sanctions on Iran until the end of March.\xc2\xa0 And that is a positive development, because the President has made the case -- as is evidenced by the letter sent by Democrats -- pretty persuasively that additional sanctions being put in place against Iran right now, in the midst of ongoing negotiations, could threaten the overall deal.\xc2\xa0 And this is a deal that has brought the Iranians to the table, that has caused them to voluntarily take the verified steps to roll back their nuclear program in a substantial way -- or at least in a meaningful way, and to present a diplomatic opening that could resolve the broader international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how different is this than what they were proposing in the first place?\xc2\xa0 Those would have been sanctions that kicked in once negotiations failed.\xc2\xa0 They weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be imposing new sanctions now.\xc2\xa0 And all they\xe2\x80\x99re saying now is that they\xe2\x80\x99ll impose new sanctions once that deadline passes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I guess the point is, is that the way that this legislation would have been interpreted by the Iranians, but, frankly, more importantly, by the international community, I think could reasonably be construed as the United States moving forward with putting in place additional sanctions while the talks are ongoing.</p>\n<p>I recognize that the legislation stipulated that the sanctions wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kick in until the end.\xc2\xa0 But I think a reasonable observer to this process, particularly an observer to this process that has worked closely with the United States to put in place the sanctions regime and, in some situations, at significant economic cost to their country, would say, why are you doing that right now?\xc2\xa0 Right now we have an agreement with the Iranians that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to roll back certain aspects of their program and engage in good-faith negotiations with the international community.\xc2\xa0 Why would we move forward with additional sanctions at this point in time?</p>\n<p>What the President has said is that if the Iranians make it clear that they will not agree with the international community to come into compliance with international expectations of their nuclear program, then the President will be the first person to go to Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we are optimistic about our success in getting Congress to move quickly to put in place additional sanctions on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And then we can go to our partners, who have been so critical to the success of the strategy, to implement the sanctions regime in a coordinated, comprehensive way that will only apply additional pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 But we can do all of that if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary and if the talks break down.\xc2\xa0 Right now there are ongoing negotiations, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary right now to put in place additional sanctions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is supportive of this particular language as it passed the committee today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that we should not be a position of putting in place additional sanctions while there are ongoing talks.\xc2\xa0 And it is now clear that there are a significant number of Democrats in the Senate who share that view, and we are pleased to have them onboard with our strategy. And it is clear that Congress will not pass additional sanctions at this point in time, and that is a good thing for the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 It improves the possibility of success for those negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the reason I say that is not because our assessment of the likelihood of success has changed; the President has said on many occasions that it\xe2\x80\x99s at best a 50/50 proposition that those negotiations will bear fruit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just that the likelihood of the success of those negotiations would have been diminished significantly had additional sanctions been put in place.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on the budget.\xc2\xa0 What do you see as the likelihood that this will pass?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a Republican majority in Congress.\xc2\xa0 They will have an opportunity to put forward their own ideas.\xc2\xa0 And what we have been clear about is that for significant pieces of legislation to pass the Congress and be signed into law, they are, by definition, going to have to be bipartisan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is, I think anybody would acknowledge, and anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s sort of observed this process even for a short period of time would acknowledge that this is the beginning of a negotiation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 Budgets are important because they\xe2\x80\x99re a way that we can codify our values and our priorities.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has codified in his budget that he\xe2\x80\x99ll release on Monday is that we need to be making investments in middle-class families; that now that we have laid a solid foundation for our economy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve bounced back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we now have an opportunity to get back to the fundamentals and to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in place policies that are focused on the middle class because our economy is going to be stronger over the long term if it\xe2\x80\x99s growing from the middle out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the sequester is unpopular on both sides, but --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99d think we\xe2\x80\x99d be able to find some bipartisan agreement around ending it, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually my question for you.\xc2\xa0 Is there a way of proposing something that would end the sequester that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include tax hikes -- which is the way the Republicans view it, and which they have rejected consistently and have done also to the comments and the announcement that came out this morning.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There could be.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to ideas that Republicans have.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not propose it from here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because what the President has put forward is what he believes is the best way for us to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what his budget reflects.\xc2\xa0 It reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we can make important investments in policies that benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 A tax cut for a family with a mom and dad who are both working, that giving them a $500 tax cut is a way that we can stretch their paycheck.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of the kinds of investments in middle-class families that we would like to make.</p>\n<p>We can do this in a fiscally responsible way.\xc2\xa0 And we can make our tax code a little bit more fair by closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected.\xc2\xa0 And those are the principles the President has been following, and I think over the course of the last five years, the President has -- there is a proven track record here that indicates this actually is in the best interest of the country and of our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But Republicans will have an opportunity to make clear what their vision is, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a robust debate about it.\xc2\xa0 And nobody is sitting here -- no President has ever put forward a budget with the expectation that Congress is going to pass it in its current form.\xc2\xa0 That was even true when there was a President whose party controlled both Houses of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Congress is a branch of government -- in fact, the founders of our country made it clear in the Constitution that the Congress would actually have the responsibility of maintaining the budget of the United States government.</p>\n<p>So this is an important announcement because it codifies the President\xe2\x80\x99s values and vision for the country.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans in Congress will certainly have their say and we look forward to seeing what they put forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And following up on Iran, can you clarify your position on the Corker-Graham bill as well?\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason why the White House wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support giving Congress a say in the Iran sanctions once they\xe2\x80\x99ve -- if a deal is reached?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that Congress has had a say, and this is actually -- for all of the talk that, admittedly, that you even hear from me, about how difficult it is to deal with Congress, this would be one area -- our efforts to put in place a sanctions regime against Iran -- where the administration and Republicans in Congress have worked effectively, together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s only because of the legislation that Congress put in place and the success that this administration has had in implementing those sanctions and working diplomatically with our partners around the globe that we have succeeded in putting significant pressure on the Iranian regime and forcing them to the negotiation table.</p>\n<p>And throughout those negotiations, the administration has kept members of Congress in the loop on the status of those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And so my point is, Congress has had a say.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome their input and their contribution to this broader effort.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the Corker-Graham legislation, this is legislation that the President would veto simply because it would -- much like the Kirk-Menendez bill -- negatively impact our ability to reach a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear program and to implement a future deal.</p>\n<p>The Corker-Graham legislation would set a harmful precedent. This administration, as I mentioned, is committed to being in close touch with the Congress, whatever the outcome.\xc2\xa0 But a congressional vote on a nonbinding instrument is not required by law and could set an unhelpful precedent for other negotiations that result in other nonbinding instruments.</p>\n<p>As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, if we reach a deal, its strength will stem from the enforcement and verification measures.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to be in a situation where we\'re taking Iran\xe2\x80\x99s word for it.\xc2\xa0 This President, this country, and the international community will insist that Iran agree to verifying its compliance with the broader agreement.\xc2\xa0 And these are verification measures that can be implemented by the IAEA, by an independent body of experts who can verify that Iran is living up to its commitments.</p>\n<p>And the President has also been clear that if Iran does fail to live up to those commitments, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a place where we can snap sanctions back into place very quickly to continue to ramp up the pressure on Iran if they don\'t live up to the terms of the agreement that they reach.\xc2\xa0 And Congress will have a role to play in lifting sanctions, but only after Iran has clearly demonstrated that it is following through on its commitments to roll back key parts of its nuclear infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just lastly, the Keystone bill passed through its last major hurdle in Senate committee today.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our position on the Keystone legislation is well known.\xc2\xa0 And if in fact, the legislation that passed the House also passes the Senate, then the President won\xe2\x80\x99t sign it.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President won\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Will not sign it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will veto it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will veto it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, getting back to the other issue that you mentioned, the Homeland Security budget, the continuing resolution that is going to expire by the end of February.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously Republicans insisted on that as a form of leverage in the hopes that the President might alter his executive action on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Will the President change that executive action in any way in order to secure funding for the Department of Homeland Security?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The funding for the Department of Homeland Security is not a political football, and the Republicans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t treat it as one.</p>\n<p>The fact is -- and I know that my colleague may have mentioned this yesterday -- that Republicans for the last six years aggressively campaigned all across the country to the American people about why they should be put in charge of the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen now that they\xe2\x80\x99re in charge of the United States Congress, and less than a month later, they\xe2\x80\x99re threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99re threatening to say, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to withhold paychecks from the people who are on the front lines keeping America safe.\xc2\xa0 These are transportation security officers, Border Patrol officials, and others who have an important role in enforcing our immigration laws and doing the other kinds of things that are critical to our homeland security.\xc2\xa0 Now --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happens to the Department as --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But let me say one other thing about this, which is there was a lot of coverage at the very end of last year and the beginning of this year, particularly from Republicans, who were talking about how important it was for political leaders to stand up for law enforcement; particularly in the aftermath of the terrible, tragic shooting of those two police officers in New York City, that we saw some very aggressive rhetoric from Republicans suggesting that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for our men and women in uniform to know that their political leaders have their back.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you could do to more undermine the relationship between political leaders and law enforcement than to threaten to withhold their paychecks even while they\xe2\x80\x99re doing their job.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the proper way to show their support for them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that before the end of February, Republicans are going to come to their senses, show some responsibility, and actually fully fund the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me turn to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday in Costa Rica, the conference down there, the Cuban President, Raul Castro, laid out some demands that he would like to see before normalizing relations with the United States.\xc2\xa0 He called for a return of Guantanamo Bay to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 He called for an end of the embargo.\xc2\xa0 He called for an end to Radio, TV Marti broadcasts, and compensation for what he described as economic damages caused by the embargo. Is the United States willing to do any of those things?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Jim, what his comments highlight is that there is a pretty clear difference between reestablishing diplomatic relations and carrying out the longer process of normalizing relations.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there are a wide variety of disagreements between the United States and Cuba, and, more directly, between the U.S. government and our values and the Cuban government and the values that they so often fail to codify -- that there are a variety of concerns that we have with the way that the Castro regime treats political dissidents, the way that they treat individuals who are trying to freely express their views, even the way that they treat some reporters.</p>\n<p>So this is not consistent with the kinds of values of this country, and so it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that we have a large number of disagreements with the Castro regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any second thoughts about what the President laid out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply the disagreement that we have with some people on Capitol Hill is about the strategy for confronting Cuba about those significant disagreements.\xc2\xa0 And the strategy that has been employed for the last five decades of trying to isolate Cuba is one that has not resulted in any of the kinds of changes that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that after the President reached this agreement with the Castro regime to begin the process of normalizing relations, we actually did start to see some small progress with the release of 50 or 55 political prisoners that were being held in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a small step, and only the first step, in a much longer journey, but it does reflect progress.</p>\n<p>And the President continues to be optimistic that by engaging Cuba and by removing this distraction from our broader relations with other countries in the hemisphere, that we can actually focus more attention on the failure of the Castro regime to live up to the expectations that we have of governments, particularly when it comes to respecting basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence to indicate already that we\xe2\x80\x99re making some preliminary progress on that measure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is Loretta Lynch going to be an independent Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that certainly was the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or was there concern up on Capitol Hill that -- they kept asking her, are you going to be another Eric Holder, and so forth, and I think the criticism that\xe2\x80\x99s implicit in those questions is that Eric Holder was not sufficiently independent.\xc2\xa0 Is the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation that Loretta Lynch will be an independent Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I think that yesterday, Ms. Lynch demonstrated to the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the people of the country exactly why the President nominated her to be the next Attorney General of the United States.\xc2\xa0 She performed extraordinarily well in a hearing that stretched for seven or eight hours.\xc2\xa0 She handled a wide variety of legal questions, some of them that could be described, I think fairly, as esoteric.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what we saw is somebody who is more than qualified to take on the responsibilities of being the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law enforcement officer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only person that was impressed. People who actually have a say in the matter seemed to be particularly impressed.\xc2\xa0 I noticed that Senator Grassley said that there\xe2\x80\x99s no question about her competence.\xc2\xa0 I noticed that Senator Graham said that he thought she was \xe2\x80\x9cvery impressive,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he\xe2\x80\x99s inclined to support her.\xc2\xa0 Even Senator Hatch said that he was going to be a strong supporter for nomination.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Perdue from Georgia said that he was very impressed with her career and wanted to thank her for upholding the law in her career.</p>\n<p>The thing that all these gentlemen have in common is not just that they serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that they\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans.\xc2\xa0 So what we hope is that the committee will act quickly to schedule a vote for her so that she can be passed from the committee and she can move to the floor of the United States Senate and be confirmed before they go on the next recess.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a clarification on -- try to get an answer to what Jim asked you.\xc2\xa0 I believe he asked you if the March 24th deadline to get a framework deal with Iran is a bright-line deadline.\xc2\xa0 You know the complaint by many that are critical of this negotiation process that it will drag on, the Iranians will use this to buy time.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s already been extended before.\xc2\xa0 Are we through with extensions?\xc2\xa0 Is this a real deadline, March 24th?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, that argument is bogus.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that argument is bogus is that in previous negotiations, Iran has succeeded in using the cover of diplomatic negotiations to try to advance their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, in the context of these negotiations, Iran has taken steps to actually roll back elements of their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And their steps to roll back elements of their program have actually been verified by the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They continue to enrich uranium now, right -- the enrichment in Iran continues to go on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But at a very low level that does not advance their efforts to build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I don\'t think that anybody who takes a look at this with an impartial view is particularly persuaded by this notion that the Iranians somehow benefit from continuing negotiations.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re still subject to a withering sanctions regime that has had a terrible toll on their economy and they\xe2\x80\x99re not advancing their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So if they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to strain negotiations, I don\'t know why they would do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, isn\'t it true -- isn\'t there\xe2\x80\x99s a financial *incentive?\xc2\xa0 Don\'t they get about -- what is it -- $4 billion a month for every month that this goes on, in assets that have been frozen in the United States they get unfrozen?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re getting billions of dollars every month these negotiations go on.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 First of all, that is money that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already earned but don\'t have access to because of the sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For very good reasons, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right, for very good reasons.\xc2\xa0 And that represents a miniscule percentage of the overall impact of the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 So there is no benefit to the Iranians in stretching out these diplomatic negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let me get to your question, which is a fair one, which is what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen if there\xe2\x80\x99s no deal by March 24th.\xc2\xa0 And all I\'d say is, we\'ll see.\xc2\xa0 If the Iranians --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re open to an extension.\xc2\xa0 You\'re open to extending this process on past March 24th, even if they don\'t --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\'m saying is I\'m not willing to prejudge the outcome at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear why there is some reason to be at least a little pessimistic about being able to reach a deal, because these negotiations have been going on for some time and we haven\'t seen the kind of breakthrough that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the pressure on the Iranians is only increasing.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we believe -- we\'re going to pursue this diplomatic opening that exists and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where things stand in March.</p>\n<p>But let me say one other thing, which is that I am confident that if the Iranians have made clear that they\'re not serious about these negotiations, the President, as he himself has said many times, will be the first person to stand up with Congress and say let\xe2\x80\x99s move on additional sanctions against Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then yesterday I had asked about the Jordanian effort to exchange -- make a prisoner exchange, hostage exchange with ISIS.\xc2\xa0 One of the questions was whether or not the review that you announced back in November I believe of our policy on dealing with hostage situations like this has been done, or when it will be done.\xc2\xa0 Is there a status update on that? Can you tell us roughly when you think that review will be completed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know when that review will be completed, Jon.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if we can get you a status update on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the other question.\xc2\xa0 I asked for verification, yesterday -- it was said that the United States government, that the White House does not consider the Taliban to be a terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how that\'s consistent with what I believe is the designation that the Treasury Department has on its list of specially designated terrorist groups, which clearly list the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 So does the administration consider the Taliban a terrorist organization or not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, the reason that the Taliban is listed on the -- this description that you have put forward here is for two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is they do carry out tactics that are akin to terrorism.\xc2\xa0 They do pursue terror attacks in an effort to try to advance their agenda.\xc2\xa0 And by designating them in the way that you have described does allow the United States to put in place some financial sanctions against the leaders of that organization in a way that\'s been beneficial to our ongoing efforts against the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true, though, Jon, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to draw a distinction between the Taliban and al Qaeda. The Taliban has resorted to terror tactics, but those terror tactics have principally been focused on Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Now, the reason that we\'re concerned about that is there obviously are a significant number of American personnel, including American military personnel in Afghanistan, that are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 The Taliban is a very dangerous organization.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has pursued is a clear strategy for building up the central government of Afghanistan and the Afghan Security Forces so that they could be responsible for security in their own country and take the fight to the Taliban.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That, however, is different than the strategy that we have pursued against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda is a terrorist organization that has aspirations that extend beyond just the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda and their affiliates around the globe have sought to carry out terror attacks against Americans and American interests all around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And that explains the difference in classification.</p>\n<p>But there is no doubt that both of these organizations are dangerous and have drawn our attention.\xc2\xa0 After all, there are a large number of Taliban fighters that have been taken off the battlefield thanks to U.S. efforts and thanks to the courage and bravery of our servicemen and women.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing you correctly, you\'re saying that the Taliban engages in \xe2\x80\x9ctactics akin to terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d but you don\'t actually consider them a terrorist group.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They have a different classification.\xc2\xa0 They have a classification that does allow us to pursue financial sanctions against them, that has succeeded in limiting their capability that have been effective.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\'t call them a terrorist group?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that is different than an organization like al Qaeda that has much broader, global aspiration to carry out acts of violence and acts of terror against Americans and American interests all around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times has a story about a senior administration official calling the Times to complain about the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Mr. Dermer, Ambassador Dermer.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House publicly make this argument, as well?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that Ambassador Dermer has acted inappropriately, specifically with the action of inviting -- of arranging for Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I did see the story that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about and I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on a number of occasions that that invitation to the Prime Minister that was conceived of and executed by the Speaker of the House and the Israeli Ambassador was a departure from protocol.\xc2\xa0 But what we have said on many occasions is that the United States commitment to our strongest ally in the Middle East, Israel, transcends partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 And I think people on both sides of that relationship understand this and understand why it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s even consistent with the sentiment that\xe2\x80\x99s been expressed by people like Shimon Peres and Ambassador Dermer\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, Michael Oren, both of whom have been pretty critical of the Prime Minister accepting the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s invitation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the point is that this relationship between the United States and Israel is bigger than any single diplomat.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s an alliance that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be turned into a relationship between two political parties.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the strong bond between the United States and Israel and our people, and our firm commitment to common interests and common values are the basis of that alliance.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to the national security of both our countries.\xc2\xa0 And all of this certainly reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to this relationship and our policy in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe Ambassador Dermer has been acting like a political operative in this?\xc2\xa0 Is that the implication?\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s not a relationship between two political parties.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this was the complaint that this, again, unnamed administration official who apparently contacted The New York Times to make this case was that Ambassador Dermer is acting inappropriately.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously made your point about the invitation being a departure from protocol, but do you believe Ambassador Dermer is acting in a way that is more political than in his traditional diplomatic role?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, the reason that we have made clear that the President will not meet with the Prime Minister when he travels to the U.S. just two weeks before the Israeli elections is that it would leave I think reasonable people with the appearance that the United States is attempting to interfere or meddle in an ongoing political process in Israel; that to meet with him just two weeks before an election could leave some people with the impression that we\xe2\x80\x99re interfering in those elections.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President wants to avoid, principally because this is not about -- this is more important than partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 This is about the foundation of an alliance that reflects our strong commitment to common values.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify something that Jon asked you about.\xc2\xa0 The attack on the Pakistani school that killed 140 kids -- was that a terrorist attack?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re -- yes, it was a terrorist attack.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that was the Taliban.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe that was actually the Pakistani Taliban, and that is an organization that is classified as a terrorist organization, and these are two different groups that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The other question about Corker-Graham --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say one thing about that, which is I think that the Pakistanis are still trying to determine precisely who is responsible for carrying out that terrorist attack, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge whatever investigation or conclusion they may arrive at.\xc2\xa0 If they conclude that it was the Pakistani Taliban that would certainly be consistent with their classification as a terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And when you say that Corker-Graham would set a harmful precedent, the President would veto it because it has to do with a non-binding instrument, do you mean something that\xe2\x80\x99s not a treaty?\xc2\xa0 Is that how that translates?\xc2\xa0 That Congress shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the business of approving or disapproving negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So this is an executive power issue.\xc2\xa0 Is that the principle at stake here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a different -- not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really thought about it that way.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could describe it that way.\xc2\xa0 But this is simply something that -- this is an agreement between not just the United States and Iran but basically Iran and the broader international community in negotiations that are essentially led by the United States and our P5-plus-1 partners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blow up the talks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like your objection to Menendez.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re objecting to this on different grounds.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear that this also has the potential to undermine the ongoing negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just Congress asking for a chance to approve or disapprove it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, because we\xe2\x80\x99d be in a situation where the United States would agree to something at the negotiating table that would be conditional.\xc2\xa0 We certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate a situation where the Iranians were to say, we totally -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll sign onto this agreement pending confirmation by some politicians back home in Iran.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we would be a party to.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have confidence that that\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement that would eventually go into effect.</p>\n<p>And I think people make reasonable assumptions -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cpeople,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean not just the Iranians but the broader international community -- would have questions at least about whether the United States could back up their commitment if they knew that it would be subject to congressional confirmation, particularly from a Congress that has not been one that\xe2\x80\x99s been particularly willing to work with the administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And a question about Cuba. Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s intention when he finally does close the Guantanamo facility to give back the actual territory to Cuba?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He wants to hang on to Guantanamo even after he empties the prison.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed down.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is, is that only -- that serving -- that continuing to operate that prison there only serves as a recruiting tool for al Qaeda and other extremist organizations around the world.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s in the view of the President and the previous administration clearly in the best interests of American national security to close the prison.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the naval base itself --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But the naval base is not something that we believe should be closed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of -- because Raul Castro\xe2\x80\x99s comments suggested that there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any normalization of relations with the U.S. unless you give that back.\xc2\xa0 So that has not been part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s discussions with Cuba?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you want to hang on to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hi there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like the President, in Philadelphia, will rally Democrats around this -- lifting the sequestration spending.\xc2\xa0 But what about some of the tougher subjects?\xc2\xa0 And trade specifically comes to mind.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate that he is going to make sort of full-on case there for Democrats to get behind the trade strategy?\xc2\xa0 And is that going to be like a tough-love talk, or kind of a sweet talk?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the case he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make, and how hard does he push today on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret, I would not anticipate that the President\xe2\x80\x99s opening remarks will include a robust discussion of his view that our economy is stronger when we put in place agreements that open up fair access to overseas markets for American businesses.\xc2\xa0 But I would not be surprised if a member of the Democratic caucus decides to ask the President about that, and I would anticipate that the President will give them an answer that\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, pretty consistent with the answer that the President has talked about publicly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we be able to hear that part?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You may not hear it in person, but I do think that there\xe2\x80\x99s probably a way we can get you a good sense of how the exchange goes down, if you will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if I can just recap, what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to say that in his great-to-see-you remarks, but it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to come up behind closed doors?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, his great-to-see-you remarks, and let\xe2\x80\x99s work together to make sure the Department of Homeland Security is fully funded.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But after those two things --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even though it will not be in the part for public consumption, but he is going to -- but you do anticipate that this is going to come up, and that when it does he\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty forceful about what he wants and when he wants it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any better read now -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit of time since the State of the Union -- about how to get there on trade and how -- really how big the opposition is?\xc2\xa0 Like, what are you working with?\xc2\xa0 What are your chances in terms of the Democratic caucus and so forth?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are probably people that have a better understanding of how the politics of this break down on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s clear to me is that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require supporters of this policy to overcome objections from both Democrats and Republicans, that there are people in both parties who have some reservations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid will.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are well-known Republicans who have articulated their opposition to some of these policy ideas as well.\xc2\xa0 And the President will make a case, and he will make this case to both Democrats and Republicans, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be relying on Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill in leadership positions to carry some of this water, too.\xc2\xa0 But the President will make a firm commitment to Democrats and Republicans that he will not present a deal to Congress for approval that does not clearly represent the best interests of the American middle class, American workers or American business owners.</p>\n<p>And the whole point of entering into negotiations and striking agreements like this is to benefit the American economy. Now, the President believes that we can strike an agreement like this that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the American economy, that also happens to be good the economy of some other countries, too.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason they would sign on to the deal.\xc2\xa0 But where it starts with the President is reaching an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the American economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the other part of this -- and this is part of the case that the President made in the State of the Union, and for those who are fortunate enough to be in the room when the President answers the question today, they\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a little bit more on this -- which is, specifically, the President does not believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in our best interest to not engage with other Asian countries as it relates to international commerce.\xc2\xa0 That if we essentially cede that ground to the Chinese, that they will enter into broader agreements with other countries in the Asia Pacific region that actually lower labor standards, that lower environmental standards, and actually make it harder for American businesses to compete and to get access to those overseas markets.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach an agreement that is in the best interest of American workers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s that failing to reach an agreement and essentially sort of withdrawing from the region would have a negative impact on the American middle class and on American workers and on American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And that will certainly be part of the case that you\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard the President make, but that will be part of the answer that he delivers today as well.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about sanctions about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The EU has indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward to extend and expand their sanctions against Russia over what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of calls between the President and European leaders, and he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Secretary Kerry today.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is are you guys teeing up additional sanctions against Russia?\xc2\xa0 And do you plan to match whatever sanctions that Europe I think is expected to vote on in a couple weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific announcements to make about our plans at this point.\xc2\xa0 But you know from having covered this issue pretty carefully over the last year that what we have sought to do is to work in coordinated fashion with our European partners to implement these sanctions; that we can maximize the impact if the sanctions regime is effectively coordinated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 And the impact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the Russian economy just in the last year I think is testament to the fact that by working in coordinated fashion, we have forced the Russian regime to encounter some costs as it relates to their policy in Ukraine; that if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to violate this core international principle about the sovereignty and integrity -- territorial integrity of their neighbors, that there are going to be economic costs associated with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there have been on a number of occasions where, based on international negotiations with our partners in Western Europe, principally, and with our observation about the ongoing situation there, where we have taken steps to ratchet up that pressure and increase the amount of sanctions that were put into place.\xc2\xa0 So certainly, based on the kind of activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Russians in the last several weeks, one might reasonably conclude that the United States and our partners are considering additional sanctions on Iran. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s reflective of the negotiations out of the EU.</p>\n<p>This is obviously a situation that we continue to watch closely and we\xe2\x80\x99re in very close touch with our EU partners, including at the highest level.\xc2\xa0 You saw that the President, I guess it was earlier this week -- it seems like a long time ago -- but earlier this week, the President had a conversation with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on this very subject.</p>\n<p>So we continue to be engaged and there is a reason that the EU is considering this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because they continue to be, as the United States is, extremely concerned about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s continued provocation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me say one other thing about this -- two other things about it -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it short, I promise.\xc2\xa0 The first is, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the administration has put forward a request from Congress to pass an additional loan guarantee, a $1 billion loan guarantee, early this year for Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine has also suffered economically from the instability in their country and doing what we can to support them is important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also why -- and this is the second thing -- it\xe2\x80\x99s also why we want Congress, as we have for some time now, to act on IMF reforms that would significantly enhance the ability of the IMF to offer some economic assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And so we hear a lot of talk on Capitol Hill from Republicans who say that we need to be doing more to support Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Well, one really important step they could take is to pass the IMF reforms that would have very little impact on our budget but actually would do a lot to increase the assistance we can offer the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing about legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s brewing up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 The AUMF -- Representative Shiff put forward his proposal yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I know that you guys, earlier this month in talks with leadership, have said that you planned to put something together, you want to consult congressional leadership. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can put a timeline on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a hot potato going on, where you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stamp your name on an AUMF because then it\xe2\x80\x99s your responsibility or your war without congressional authorization. And Congress wants you to do that so that it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of pinned on you guys.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, obviously you want to consult with Capitol Hill, but at what point do you just say this is what we want?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t entirely agree with your characterization, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable observation.\xc2\xa0 And so let me try to give you a better sense of how we see this situation.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with leaders on Capitol Hill, they have indicated a desire to weigh in on the strategy as well.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a situation where the President is looking to absolve himself of responsibility for this military strategy.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the Commander-in-Chief; he knew what he was signing up for when he ran for the job.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to take responsibility for this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, he has also taken responsibility for a strategy that seems to be working.\xc2\xa0 We built this international coalition of more than 60 countries.\xc2\xa0 We have enjoyed some success in taking strikes against ISIL targets that have diminished their capacity. There are reports that significant progress has been made in the last few days to try to push ISIL out of Kobani.\xc2\xa0 So there are important successes here to note, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that remains to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that our strategy is stronger when we can demonstrate to the international community -- to our allies, and to our enemies -- that there is broad bipartisan support for the strategy that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we want Congress to weigh in.</p>\n<p>Now, the President has committed to putting forward legislation that we write and submit to Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President has also been clear, though, that he wants to make sure that whatever request we make and whatever language we put forward is the kind of language that can attract bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re eager to get Congress to sort of weigh in at least privately with us on the front end, so we can be sure that whatever we put forward is something that enjoys the support of Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I might add that Democrats and Republicans who are interested in voting for an authorization to use military force have said the same thing -- that they want to have a chance to weigh in on this language so that it\xe2\x80\x99s language that they feel like they can support and advocate for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest that you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like right now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got language that has bipartisan support, since you haven\xe2\x80\x99t put something forward?\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the sticking points are.\xc2\xa0 Where are you struggling to win over either Republicans or Democrats on this issue and work through that?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just kind of you guys are happy because you have authorization and you think things are working so --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No -- I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you raised this because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people to be confused about the fact that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t sent up legislation yet, or legislative language yet is an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a decision to not try to seek an authorization to use military force or that we\xe2\x80\x99re somehow losing our appetite for that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 This administration definitely wants Congress to act in bipartisan fashion to pass an authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 And we are being careful to craft language that we are confident can be passed in bipartisan fashion once we send it up.\xc2\xa0 And trying to find bipartisan agreement on some of these issues is difficult.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t soft-pedal that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- last year that passed through the Senate committee, right, with bipartisan support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- at the very end of last year? I thought that that passed along party lines.\xc2\xa0 I think it did.\xc2\xa0 And that reflects why we want to try to work with Democrats and Republicans on the front end here to get some bipartisan support on the back end.\xc2\xa0 And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment that\xe2\x80\x99s shared by Republicans and Democrats on the Hill as well.\xc2\xa0 So this is an area where there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to work together, and I\xe2\x80\x99m reasonably optimistic that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do so, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s easy.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, to Jeff earlier you reiterated the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on Keystone, that he would veto a bill, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to Senators Bennet, Carper, Casey, Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin, McCaskill, Tester and Warner -- Democrats -- a fifth of the Democratic caucus in the Senate who voted to move this legislation forward?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 His message to them is the same as the message that I have to deliver to you, which is the President believes that the best way for us to resolve the -- for us to determine whether or not building the Keystone pipeline is in the national interest of the United States is to allow the well-established administrative process to be carried out, and that will allow experts in the field of the environment and of energy policy to carefully examine the route of the pipeline, the potential impact it could have on communities that are along that route, and to determine whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s in the national interest.\xc2\xa0 And based on that determination, the project will either go forward or not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but you, from the podium, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of Union characterized this focus on the Keystone project as a waste of time.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said almost that exact phrase from the podium.\xc2\xa0 The President said that we could be focusing on other projects and get things done at the State of Union.\xc2\xa0 Does he think that these Democrats are joining Republicans in wasting the American people\xe2\x80\x99s time by --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- a waste of time is your characterization.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I wanted to follow on your earlier answer to Jeff. When you hear the cries of \xe2\x80\x9cdead on arrival,\xe2\x80\x9d does that change your approach to the budget in any way?\xc2\xa0 When you realize that both houses of Congress are hostile to specific things, do you use the budget for broader message-sending or setting the agenda? How do things change?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly are never pleased to see Republicans unilaterally rule out making any progress on policies that are beneficial to middle-class families, but it certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done that many times, maybe even daily over the last several years.\xc2\xa0 And the President, by scratching and fighting tooth and nail for the middle class, has enjoyed some success in putting in place policies that benefit the middle class.</p>\n<p>The best example of this is in the context of the fiscal cliff negotiations at the end of 2012, that for years -- for decades, in fact, Republicans have prided themselves on blocking all efforts to raise taxes.\xc2\xa0 Well, after fighting for four years and following up on a promise that he\xe2\x80\x99d made as a presidential candidate, the President succeeded in getting Congress -- with Republican support -- to pass legislation that raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans and protected tax cuts for the vast majority of Americans, including all middle-class families.</p>\n<p>So that is one example of Republicans pronouncing something \xe2\x80\x9cdead on arrival,\xe2\x80\x9d and then the President, through sheer determination and some political persuasion, did succeed in getting that policy across the finish line.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have to do that again.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- the President has plenty of energy and appetite for a fight over policies that are going to benefit middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does your approach to the budget change in any way given the changed reality on the Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply that the budget is the responsibility of the President to lay out and to codify in clear dollars and cents what his priorities and values are.\xc2\xa0 Republicans will be responsible for doing the same thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as I mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s never an expectation on the part of any President that the Congress is going to pass every single element of his budget.\xc2\xa0 That was even true when Democrats were in charge of the Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that was true when Republican President Bush put forward a budget proposal to a Republican-led Congress.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the expectation that it was going to be passed in whole by the Congress, but yet it would serve as a clear enunciation of that President\xe2\x80\x99s values and priorities, and I think often does reasonably serve as a starting point for negotiations.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about the fact that any significant legislation that passes through the Congress will, by definition, have to have bipartisan support, because it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be passed by a Republican majority and signed into law by a Democratic President.\xc2\xa0 And certainly when it comes to issues of the budget, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for common ground and bipartisanship there, too.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Congressman Schiff\xe2\x80\x99s AUMF legislation.\xc2\xa0 It includes language that would prohibit the use of ground troops.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Kerry a while back, he said that that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be part of the AUMF language.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration still stand by that?\xc2\xa0 Are you still opposed to legislation that would prohibit the use of ground troops?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to negotiate the language from here.\xc2\xa0 We are having private negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on the Hill about what should be included in the agreement.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that seems like a very basic tenet of any piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President has said multiple times that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to send U.S. troops -- put U.S. troops on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So is that something that you would be opposed to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work out with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate your raising what is a principle that the President has established from the very first day he started talking about ISIL, which is that he does not believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the United States for us to commit a significant contingent of American ground troops in a combat role to fight ISIL.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the best way for us to do this is to put American troops in a situation where they can use their skills and expertise to train up local forces that can take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about Yemen.\xc2\xa0 There were some protestors who were beaten back by the opposition forces in Sana\xe2\x80\x99a on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And have you been in contact with any of the opposition forces?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, what I can tell you is that the people of Yemen deserve a clear path back to a legitimate federal and unitary Yemeni government, consistent with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference, U.N. Security Council resolutions, and Yemeni law, with clearly defined timelines to finish writing a Yemeni constitution, to hold a referendum on the constitution and then to launch national elections.</p>\n<p>The point is, we believe that the transition that\xe2\x80\x99s underway in Yemen should be a peaceful one, and we certainly would not condone or approve of any act of violence.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that ultimately the government in Yemen, after going through what would be a difficult and time-consuming process, is one that should reflect previous agreements that have been made and, more importantly, should reflect the will of the Yemeni people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult work.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about here in the context of some of these other things, democracy is messy, but we do believe that the Yemeni people will benefit from having a government that reflects their will.\xc2\xa0 And we would encourage all of the parties in this ongoing dispute here to subscribe to that principle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to nail down, though -- has anyone from this administration been in contact with the opposition forces, with outgoing President Hadi?\xc2\xa0 Who are you in contact with there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that in the context of all of Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s communities and parties to this dispute, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with many of them about the latest political developments and to try to ensure the safety of the American personnel that are still in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out.</p>\n<p>But certainly we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in engaging at a political level to try to advance our interests in that country, and to encourage them to pursue and resolve their differences peacefully in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of their people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just trying again at one -- and I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten this question before -- but the President has been insistent that U.S. counterterrorism operations aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be impacted by these new opposition forces who are now in control.\xc2\xa0 But how is that possible in the long term?\xc2\xa0 I know that there were reports of recent drone strikes there.\xc2\xa0 But how can that be possible in the long term if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the cooperation of the party in power there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 I have seen the reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to about some drone strikes in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on those.\xc2\xa0 I can neither confirm nor deny their existence.\xc2\xa0 But what I can is I can tell you that we do continue to have an ongoing security relationship with the national security infrastructure in Yemen, some of which -- much of which is still functioning.\xc2\xa0 So there are still coordinated efforts underway to apply pressure on AQAP leaders in Yemen and to diminish their operational capability.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that requires a lot of vigilance and a lot of work, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that continues to this day.</p>\n<p>That said, we have also been pretty forthright about the fact that our security efforts there, our counterterrorism efforts there are enhanced when we have a good partner in the central government and it\xe2\x80\x99s a central government that reflects the will of the people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that we have an interest in the peaceful resolution of this ongoing political dispute in Yemen, is that it will enhance our ability to coordinate with that government and carry out counterterrorism operations that are in the best interests of American national security.</p>\n<p>So the point is, we do want these problems to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 It will be in the best interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But our ongoing counterterrorism efforts against AQAP continue to this minute.</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House at the plight of congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle facing the specter of sequestration, knowing that they may have to make incredibly difficult choices that could impact national security, holding the line on the budget and yet making sure the Pentagon is properly funded?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, this is one of the reasons that the administration is going to put forward a budget that actually raises the caps on sequestration, that we believe that important investments in non-defense programs that benefit the middle class are important, but so are programs that will benefit our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard any number of our military leaders articulate the concerns that they have with sequestration and the impact it has had on the ability of our men and women in uniform to keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0 Let me just read you one quote from the Chief of Naval Operations.\xc2\xa0 He said that, \xe2\x80\x9cWith each year of sequestration, the loss of force structure, readiness and future investments would cause our options to become increasingly constrained and drastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Odierno, said that \xe2\x80\x9cSequestration is the single greatest barrier to the effectiveness of our armed forces.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So this administration has been very clear, as have our military leaders, about the fact that sequestration is a bad policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been bad for our economy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for our national security as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President proposes to end it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that will come primarily from tax cuts -- taxes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the way that the President believes that we should pay for some of these new investments that are needed is by closing loopholes that benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that if making the investments that are necessary to the national security of the United States means that some of our financial firms on Wall Street have to pay just a little bit more, the President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s a good policy choice, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one we\xe2\x80\x99ll pursue.</p>\n<p>If Republicans disagree with that they\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do so, but it certainly means that their policies and their values and their priorities deserve some scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you something that happened on FOX News last night on Special Report with Bret Baier.\xc2\xa0 House Speaker John Boehner made the suggestion that the Republicans will offer an alternative to Obamacare, for lack of a better description.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, can you tell me what you think about that possibility?\xc2\xa0 And is this good for the dialogue, to have the Republicans offer up something that would be an alternative to the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll believe it when we see it, Kevin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>J.C.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s question, there\xe2\x80\x99s been</p>\n<p>-- can you tell us whether or not you believe that Iran is directly or indirectly involved in the Houthis insurgent activities in Yemen presently?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have expressed some concern in the past, J.C., about the links between the Houthis and the Iranian military and some of their security apparatus.\xc2\xa0 We do have concerns about that.\xc2\xa0 At this point, we do not have any indication that Iranian military leaders, or any Iranians, frankly, are exercising any specific command-and-control functions, but we do continue to be concerned about the influence and some of the connections and ties between the Houthis, their leaders and Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Francesca.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The Army concluded its investigation into Bowe Bergdahl\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance several months ago.\xc2\xa0 When is that report coming out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question that you should direct to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 They can give you a sense of the status of that negotiation -- or the status of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an independent investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted by the United States Army, so I don\'t have any insight into the status of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a related note, if it\xe2\x80\x99s patently false that they\'re going to charge him with desertion, why was he not at the State of Union?\xc2\xa0 Allan Gross was at the State of Union.\xc2\xa0 He was someone else who was in a prison for five years and released in a prisoner swap.\xc2\xa0 So why was Bowe Bergdahl not at the State of Union?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what my colleague over at the Pentagon said was patently false was that the Army -- or that the Army investigator had made a decision about his case.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- again, according to the comments from my colleague over at the Pentagon -- that that investigation is still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And so when they have an update in terms of that status, it will come from them, not from us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, really quickly, the Prayer Breakfast, is Obama going?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has in the past attended the National Prayer Breakfast.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at his schedule for next week, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if he didn\'t attend.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have a quick budget question.\xc2\xa0 There are budget groups and members on the Hill who will be reading the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget document, looking at how he treats long-term debt and the problem of mandatory entitlement.\xc2\xa0 If reading that, in reading the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, he does not have any explicit proposals of his own to deal with that particularly problem, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s chained CPI for Social Security or Medicare changes, should we interpret that as his being open to negotiations with the Hill as the budget is developed later on?\xc2\xa0 Or is it because he\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying that that really isn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem that needs to be addressed right now because of the Affordable Care Act or other initiatives?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a very creative way to ask the question.\xc2\xa0 And so even though my instinct is to dismiss it and say we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to speak in greater detail about this on Monday when the budget is released, I will, however, point out a couple of things that I think are relevant to the question that you\'ve asked.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The first is that there are, as you point out, a number of policies that this administration has put in place that will have a positive impact in our deficit picture, things like the Affordable Care Act, that there are significant government savings associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Those savings only get bigger in the out-years.\xc2\xa0 So when we\'re talking about reducing our long-term deficit and debt, the effective implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an important part of that.\xc2\xa0 And it will have significant and positive impact on our long-term deficit picture.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the first thing.</p>\n<p>That\'s also true of some of the other policies the President has been advocating for, including immigration reform, that there are billions that we could save by reforming our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans who profess to support deficit reduction and be concerned about our debt have blocked that common-sense bipartisan proposal, much to our consternation.</p>\n<p>The last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that the President, of course, is open to having a conversation with Republicans about what we can do to address our longer-term debt picture.\xc2\xa0 That said, the President is not going to reduce our debt solely on the back of our seniors and our middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do it.\xc2\xa0 The President -- that\'s been a core principle since this President took office.</p>\n<p>We have succeeded in reducing our deficit dramatically since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that without making seniors and the middle class bear all of the load.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re certainly not going to impose that kind of burden on seniors and the middle class to reduce our longer-term deficit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on Mara\xe2\x80\x99s question to you about Guantanamo, the naval base.\xc2\xa0 A few weeks ago when you were asked about this, you said you knew of no -- if I recall, you said you knew of no concept or proposal.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re much firmer today.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to know is it because you went and checked, and it turned out we don\'t have any plans?\xc2\xa0 Or is it because that was sort of in the atmosphere, and then the President has now decided that is not going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, this is, in my undying effort to try to provide you with more information about the views of the administration, I was able to obtain additional information that allows me to conclusively rule out any discussion about returning the military base in Guantanamo Bay to the Cubans.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up on Guantanamo.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How, with your Republican Congress, can the President close Guantanamo?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been clear about the fact that Republicans in Congress -- and this is true of some Democrats, too -- that they have put in place obstacles that are making this process very difficult.\xc2\xa0 And that is not in the best interest of our national security.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that that prison should be closed.\xc2\xa0 And if we got cooperation from Congress, that\'s something that we could do in relatively short order.</p>\n<p>But because of legislative obstacles that have been thrown up repeatedly by members of Congress, this effort has become much more difficult.\xc2\xa0 But the President is determined to try to make progress and we\'re going to continue to work on this.\xc2\xa0 And this I think would sort of be an example of the President scratching and clawing to try to do what he thinks is in the best interest of the country, even over the objections of some members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can the President do an executive order to close Guantanamo?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at this point the President is doing everything that he can and is going to consider any new ideas that anybody has to try to continue to make progress on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to preview at this point.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can the Afghan Taliban not be considered a terrorist organization for purposes of the rest of the U.S. government, when the Treasury considers it, and when it has a long history of terrorist acts -- why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Bill, because what we have done is it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there is a difference between the ambitions that are expressed by the Taliban and the ambitions that are expressed by al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it hangs entirely on the fact that they are local and al Qaeda is international?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly makes clear that their aspirations are different.\xc2\xa0 It means that they\xe2\x80\x99re a threat to the American people and our interests are different.\xc2\xa0 The Taliban is very dangerous and we have expended significant sums of money and American servicemembers have given their lives fighting the Taliban because they do pose a threat to American interests and to American servicemembers inside of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And we have used some financial sanctions instruments to try to limit the capacity of the Taliban by imposing the sanctions against them.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the threat from the Taliban is different than the threat that is posed by al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but it may be smaller in scope but what is the real difference?\xc2\xa0 I mean, why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the difference, Bill, is simply that the threat that they pose is different; that the threat from the Taliban is acute if you are a servicemember serving in Afghanistan or if you are a U.S. diplomat or a contractor that is working in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they terrorists?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t every terrorist group a little different from every other terrorist group?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are, but in this case, there is a clear difference between the aspirations that have been articulated by the Taliban and the way that they carry out -- or the way that they resort to some of their terror tactics and the terror attacks that are carried out by al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the fact that these are very dangerous organizations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States government, under the leadership of this President, has devoted significant resources to defeating them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to implement our strategy in Afghanistan that has now turned over the responsibility for the security in Afghanistan to Afghan security forces and their central government.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support them as they take the fight to the Taliban.</p>\n<p>This is not a situation of underestimating the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 The President is keenly aware of how dangerous this organization is. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we are forthright about the fact that American personnel serving in Afghanistan continue to face a threat.\xc2\xa0 And we have not ruled out that there would be some situations in which U.S. servicemembers would still carry out operations in self-defense against the Taliban or other terrorists who are operating in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that the Afghan Taliban doesn\xe2\x80\x99t operate outside of attacks on our personnel in Afghanistan --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, in fact --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- therefore they\xe2\x80\x99re not terrorists?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In fact, Bill, the Taliban in Afghanistan have actually carried out more attacks against the Afghan people than they have even Americans, which is why we support the Afghan central government in trying to defeat them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they terrorists?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just asking, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they a terrorist group?\xc2\xa0 Simply, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they a terrorist group?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, and what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we have been very clear about what our strategy is to defeat them.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s different than the strategy --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s different than the strategy that we have employed against al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it because we don\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate with terrorists and yet we negotiated for the release of Sergeant Bergdahl?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about the fact that the conversations with the Taliban were executed through the Qatari government and that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that that release was secured.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a quid pro quo.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that Latin phrase is appropriate in this situation but there was an agreement to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl and it was predicated on a core value, a principle that this Commander-in-Chief subscribes to, which is that somebody who signs up to serve in our Armed Forces is not going to get left behind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, how is that any different from the Jordanians possibly trading for their prisoner?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable question, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a question that you should ask the Jordanian government.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just following up on Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question about the event later today in Philadelphia and trade issues.\xc2\xa0 Just this week, Republican committees or -led committees in the Senate and House had hearings on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trade agenda with Mike Froman there, and at those hearings, they\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that they may go forward with a bill that could give the President more authority to sort of do some of these trade deals.\xc2\xa0 But they said specifically the President needs to get on the phone and make the case to fellow Democrats to get this across the finish line, to get those final votes we need.\xc2\xa0 The President not making sort of a proactive statement today on this issue, is that to imply that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think his voice is important to carry the day and to keep that message out there?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House really just going to answer questions rather than sort of proactively push for this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I guess I would say that for those who wonder why the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the phone and make the case directly to Democrats, I\xe2\x80\x99d actually say that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing them one better.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to go get on an airplane, fly to Philadelphia, go to where the House Democrats are meeting, and make the case to them in person.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the reason that -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s proactive case in the beginning will be focused on some other topics, but the President, I think by virtue of the fact that he mentioned in his State of the Union address, cares deeply and does consider this to be a priority.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to a conversation that he can have with Democrats on this issue.</p>\n<p>At the same time -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to overlook this -- there is well-chronicled opposition among some members of the Democratic caucus in both the House and the Senate who are opposed to any sort of trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also opposition in the Republican rank and file in the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So as we consider building this bipartisan coalition to give the President the authority to negotiate an agreement that would be in the best interest of American middle-class families to open up markets overseas for American businesses, that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require work on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to, no doubt, do his part to bring Democrats along, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be counting on Republican leaders to do the same thing on the Republican side of the aisle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President\xe2\x80\x99s voice today be able to sort of sway opinion in a party that\xe2\x80\x99s very conflicted about trade, maybe opposes it?\xc2\xa0 He can make a different here really talking about that.\xc2\xa0 Why not talk about it proactively?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just too much time on these other topics that are --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, the President wants to go and have a conversation with the issues that are of most interest to them. And there are a couple of things that he\xe2\x80\x99ll mention at the top.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep his remarks relatively short, as those of you who are traveling today will see.</p>\n<p>But the President would welcome the opportunity to have a discussion with them to talk about why the President supports trade promotion authority.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s trade promotion authority that would be in support of an agreement that the President would only sign if he believed it was clearly in the best interests of American middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Julie.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s visit for a minute. I know you said this relationship is bigger than any one person. But just to clarify, does the President share the view, do people at the White House share the view that the Israeli ambassador is more concerned with the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s politics than the U.S.-Israel relationship?</p>\n<p>And then given the importance of the relationship, has the White House or anyone in the administration communicated with the Prime Minister or with the Israeli government any desire that he be reprimanded, removed, that anyone should take any action given that he is sort of the pivot point of this important relationship?\xc2\xa0 He is the main conduit between the two in this country for Israel.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do want to be clear about one thing, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- no one in the administration is contemplating taking some sort of action against Ambassador Dermer.\xc2\xa0 And we should be clear about that.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that simply is the principle that I laid out before, that this relationship extends far beyond just one diplomat.\xc2\xa0 And it should extend far beyond just the relationship between two political parties -- one in this country and one in the other.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what we want to do is we want to make sure that our alliance, as it has for decades, rests upon the common values and our common national security interests.</p>\n<p>And that\'s certainly been reflected in the way that this President has implemented our policy when it comes to Israel and the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President has advocated aggressively for funding for certain Israeli national security programs.\xc2\xa0 So as recently as last summer, the President called on Congress in short order to pass hundreds of millions of dollars to resupply the Iron Dome program in Israel that was protecting innocent Israeli citizens from rockets that were being fired by extremists in Gaza.</p>\n<p>And that\'s why even Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has noted that the security cooperation that the nation of Israel has received from the Obama administration is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And that I think is a reflection of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to not allow this important relationship between our two countries to get bogged down in partisan politics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern here at the White House that the speech and the way in which it came together is going to undermine the bipartisan support that all those steps you outlined, as well as many others, have had historically in Congress in terms of keeping the U.S. commitment to Israel strong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I can say is that the President is determined to make sure that we don\'t see our relationship with Israel reduced to just a political relationship, that that relationship is too important both to the people of Israel but also to the people of the United States.</p>\n<p>And that is why the President has taken the step and made this decision not to meet with the Israeli Prime Minster when he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s rooted solely in his desire to not leave anybody with the impression that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to meddle in an Israeli election that\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for two weeks later.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to make that kind of decision and publicize it, even though it is subject to some criticism, again, along party lines, I think is a reflection of his determination to ensure that our relationship rises above any sort of partisan squabbling.\xc2\xa0 Our relationship with Israel can\xe2\x80\x99t just be reduced to the relationship between two political parties.</p>\n<p>For generations of Israeli leaders and American leaders, the strong bond between the U.S. and Israel has transcended partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes and he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly conducted himself in a manner that illustrates that he believes that tradition should continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>John, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You sent out the readout yesterday of the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with Prime Minster Tsipras in Greece, and two things.\xc2\xa0 First, are any plans underway for the Prime Minster to visit the United States any time soon and meet with the President here?\xc2\xa0 Second, the President rarely, if ever, comments on the politics in any country individually, as you just made clear.\xc2\xa0 However, Greek voters did send a shock out with the third place showing of the Golden Dawn party, which is openly anti-immigrant, in fact, wants to deport all immigrants in Greece.\xc2\xa0 Did the President express any thoughts about that at all when he talked to the Prime Minster, or on any other occasions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel plans to announce.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any travel plans that the Prime Minster has, but you can check with his government to see if he\xe2\x80\x99s planning to visit the U.S.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Greek politics, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that they were focused on Greek politics in that conversation.\xc2\xa0 It was mostly focused on the kinds of steps that Greece can take to put in place the economic reforms that are going to be in the best interest of their people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President made clear, as we said in the readout, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with Greek leaders and the Greek people to put in place policies that are in the best interest of that country, and the best interest of the broader European and global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:35 P.M.
