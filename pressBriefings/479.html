Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:13 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here on yet another beautiful spring day -- or so it seems.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements at the top, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to Jim Kuhnhenn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was on the Hill today and met privately with House Democrats and the authorization bill was a topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0 And the Congressman who came out -- John Yarmuth -- later told reporters that Denis said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s no bill that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, we can live with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether, with still having the consequences of sequestration, does having no bill still leave you in a similarly bad place in terms of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to confirm secondhand quotations from the Chief of Staff in a private meeting.\xc2\xa0 I can obviously --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it reflect the White House position that having no bill is fine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, we prefer legislation that effectively funds the necessary priorities and the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities and that achieves all of the priorities that the President has set forth.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have, again, a readout for you or a confirmation or even guidance on a private conversation between the Chief of Staff and members of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This weekend is Memorial Day Weekend and the President has made it a tradition to go to Arlington and deliver an address.\xc2\xa0 This year, can we expect him to address this issue of the Veterans Affairs and the troubles that are facing that agency?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview for the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule on Memorial Day, but he will certainly, as he has every year as President, convey the nation\xe2\x80\x99s everlasting appreciation to those who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their country.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I ask you to wait until the day itself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the Thai military declaring martial law?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are obviously monitoring events and are aware of reports that Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s army has declared martial law.\xc2\xa0 As the State Department said last night, the United States remains very concerned about the deepening political crisis there, and urges all parties to respect democratic principles, including to honor its commitment to make -- sorry -- including respect for freedom of speech and freedom of the press.</p>\n<p>We expect the army to honor its commitment to make this a temporary action to prevent violence, and not to undermine democratic institutions.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. firmly believes that all parties must exercise restraint and work together to resolve differences through peaceful dialogue to find a way forward.\xc2\xa0 This development underscores the need for elections to determine the will of the Thai people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whom is the United States speaking to in terms of the government there?\xc2\xa0 Are you speaking to the caretaker government?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the government remains in place.\xc2\xa0 There is a caretaker government or a caretaker prime minister, as I understand it.\xc2\xa0 And the Thai military, which has been reported has declared martial law, has also made a commitment to make this a temporary action and not to undermine the country\xe2\x80\x99s democratic institutions.\xc2\xa0 And we expect the army to honor that commitment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, has Rob Nabors given any kind of an update to the President since going over to the VA?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you about Mr. Nabors is that he has been dispatched to the VA at the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion -- a suggestion that was endorsed strongly by the President.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on the review that Secretary Shinseki has announced and has launched of the allegations regarding waiting lists and disclosure of waiting lists and wait times when it comes to getting benefits and services.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that Rob is on his way to Phoenix to visit the Phoenix Veterans Affairs medical facility to meet with its acting director as part of this review.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to the results both of the review and of the independent investigation that is underway and is being conducted by the inspector general.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation in terms of the timetable for that review?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the VA for a timetable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is his expectation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is for it to be comprehensive and for it to elucidate what happened, and for it to contain within it a clear indication of how to make improvements where they are necessary.\xc2\xa0 He also awaits the independent investigation of the inspector general.</p>\n<p>The President is focused on, in this matter, making sure that we know all the facts and that we act on those facts to better serve our veterans who so deserve the benefits that are granted to them through the VA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t set a deadline for when he\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear back?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President obviously wants both of these two inquiries to proceed efficiently and quickly, but to be comprehensive and effective.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not setting an arbitrary deadline.\xc2\xa0 He expects both of them -- or hopes that both of them will be, again, comprehensive and effective.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I refer you to the VA where I think the Secretary and others have indicated, or at least provided more detail about the review and what their expectations of it are.\xc2\xa0 But what I would like to note to you is that Rob Nabors is on his way or will be traveling to Phoenix on Wednesday evening.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with leadership there at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix, including Interim Chief Steve Young, who was appointed following U.S. Secretary of Veteran Affairs Eric Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s decision to place the director and two other employees there on administrative leave.\xc2\xa0 Nabors will also conduct a site visit of the facility and meet with local veteran service organizations as part of his trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Today, Rob Nabors is also engaging with several VSOs in Washington, D.C., including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, and Vietnam Veterans of America -- all of these meetings taking place ahead of his visit to Phoenix.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To be clear, is that Wednesday or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 He will be on his way to Arizona Wednesday evening.\xc2\xa0 He is having these meetings prior to his departure for Phoenix.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those meetings are going to take place on the day of Wednesday or the day of Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today, he is having these meetings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Phoenix meeting will take place when?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He leaves tomorrow evening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they will happen also tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding on how the clock works it will probably happen Thursday if he is leaving tomorrow evening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they are three hours behind us, so it could also happen when he lands.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I refer you to the VA for the minute-by-minute schedule.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the folks over at the American Legion have emailed out to reporters a memo dated April 26, 2010 -- and I think this memo came up at the Senate hearing last week on the VA issues -- and it talks about certain facilities adopting use of inappropriate scheduling practices, sometimes referred to as gaming strategies.\xc2\xa0 And the memo goes on to warn facilities not to use these strategies to conceal the wait times.\xc2\xa0 It seems as though -- looking at this memo and the fact that it was brought up at a hearing last week -- that this has been going on for years, this concealing of wait times.\xc2\xa0 How is it -- is the President satisfied that he had not heard of this until these news reports?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear, because there was a misunderstanding and a lot of misreporting about this specific topic.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, I was asked I think by you when did the President learn of the specific allegations, or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what I understood your question to be -- of the specific allegations contained first, I believe, in a CNN report about the Phoenix facility.\xc2\xa0 The President, as we all know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed it here, has been talking about the issues and challenges facing the VA since he was a candidate.\xc2\xa0 And it was precisely those problems that had been identified and were discussed in 2006, 2007 and 2008 that he spoke about as a candidate and that led him to commit to increased resources available to the VA so that we could better serve our veterans and to deliver on that commitment every year since he\xe2\x80\x99s been President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, no, this is not a new issue to the President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has been focused on it since he has been President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has been so focused on improving service and care for our veterans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has directed his administration to take the steps that it has taken to expand access for our veterans to the important benefits that they have earned and deserve.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has directed his administration and the VA to create a presumption of acceptance for disability claims when it comes to those exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam conflict, and to those who have suffered from PTSD -- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder -- in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Again, that greatly expands --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s known about the long wait times for several years, but the issue of the concealing of those wait times, the practices that were being implemented at certain facilities around the country to hide the wait times to make their records I guess look better in terms of how long veterans would have to wait -- that is something that the President did not know about until just a few weeks ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we can repeat this, and I apologize if there was a lack of clarity on my part yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I was responding to a question about, I understood, from CNN about CNN\xe2\x80\x99s report about allegations, including that some veterans had died as a result of these issues in the Phoenix facility.\xc2\xa0 That matter is under independent investigation by the IG.\xc2\xa0 The IG himself has made some statements about that investigation and the results of it so far.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Eric Shinseki, has also launched his own review of those allegations and others that have emerged in the wake of that reporting.</p>\n<p>And we, the President and the rest of us, await the results of those two inquiries.\xc2\xa0 And he is not at all pleased with some of the allegations and will be extremely unhappy if some of them prove to be true.\xc2\xa0 But he will wait for the facts and the investigations, as we all should, and then insist that action be taken and people be held accountable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how long has the President known about the concealing of these wait times?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jim, I would urge you to wait for the investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long has the Secretary known about these wait times?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Veterans Affairs Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just don\'t know that at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer for questions about the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to the VA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how would you respond to the House Majority Leader, Eric Cantor -- he said earlier this morning that -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing here -- that the President seems to keep learning about these scandals through news reports.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s a product of perhaps my lack of clarity yesterday and some I think reporting inaccuracies.\xc2\xa0 I was responding specifically to a CNN report that I think people learned when they either saw it on CNN or heard the report about it.\xc2\xa0 The President has been discussing these issues and pressing Congress to tackle these issues since he was a candidate for this office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, we can go over the record of support for our veterans since President Obama took office, the request for additional funding that the President has made every year he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office for the VA, the expansion of services that he has directed take place through the VA on his watch, and the overall commitment that he has to our veterans.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to go through that record with you again if you like.</p>\n<p>Our focus on -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus isn\xe2\x80\x99t on glib rejoinders.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on getting results and finding out exactly what happened and making sure people are held accountable for any malfeasance or misdeeds that may have taken place.\xc2\xa0 Before we know that, we have to wait for these investigations, which is the right way to go about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President still plans to comment on this soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The President was meeting this morning with business leaders and it got us thinking about the trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if trade agreements were discussed this morning, T-TIP or TPP?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President had an excellent meeting with CEOs from a variety of companies -- I think 11 all told, foreign and domestic -- focused on his SelectUSA initiative.\xc2\xa0 It is aimed at encouraging companies to invest here in the United States where the economy has been stronger than in many places around the world, where energy prices are low and where we have a highly productive workforce.\xc2\xa0 That has been the focus so far this week of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time and attention, and will continue to be as he proceeds through the week.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll obviously make that a focus of his remarks when we\'re at Cooperstown on Thursday because tourism is an important source of foreign direct investment in the United States.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have a readout on all the topics of conversation that were discussed today in the meeting except to say that the President found it excellent and he found a lot of receptivity among this group, because this is a group of individuals who represent corporations who have either brought back operations to the United States or have made new investments in the United States, reflecting a trend that is very positive for the U.S. economy and for U.S. workers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In those business people there was one Canadian who has invested in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 What kind of message do you send to foreign businessmen, not just the Americans who bring back employees and jobs, but also the other ones -- what kind of message --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re in a global economic competition, and the President believes that we, the United States, have to do the best job we can of making clear to multinational corporations and foreign corporations that the United States is a very attractive place to invest, to build and to hire.\xc2\xa0 So he absolutely welcomes foreign direct investment.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a piece of what drives our economy and the kind of investment that we seek from foreign companies is the kind that brings high-paying, quality jobs to the shores of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s good for the American economy and good for American workers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on this topic, Senator Levin, of course, introduced a bill this morning that would ban or make it harder to do corporate inversions.\xc2\xa0 Is that a bill that if it reaches the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk the President would support?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t obviously reviewed any legislation at this point yet.\xc2\xa0 On the general principle that we should have a tax code that does not reward companies for moving their operations and jobs overseas but instead encourages them to invest here in the United States and to build businesses and jobs here in the United States is one that is reflected in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 And he encourages Congress, especially Republicans in Congress, to approach tax reform in a way that keeps this issue very much high on the priority list.\xc2\xa0 We need to reform our tax code in a way that makes investment in the United States attractive, that creates incentives for companies to invest here, instead of a tax code where, as currently exists, there are loopholes that companies can exploit to avoid the taxes they owe on U.S. income.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of resistance to that proposition from Republicans, but we hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll change their opinion.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how does the President want Rob Nabors to function as he conducts the review, so that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As he always has, professionally and effectively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- observers are not concerned that the President is putting a political thumb on the scale while an independent investigation by the IG is underway?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let others evaluate the politics of this or who\xe2\x80\x99s injecting politics in it.\xc2\xa0 The President sent Rob Nabors over there because Rob Nabors is a professional and is one of his most trusted advisors.\xc2\xa0 And he expects Rob to work with the Secretary and others at the VA on this review so that we can get to the bottom of these issues, find out what happened, take remedial action where necessary and hold people accountable where necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me just follow up.\xc2\xa0 If the President sends an aide, a top advisor to interview, or to take a site visit and, in effect, talk to the same individuals that the IG wants to interview, is there a perception that the White House is trying to do more than review, but is maybe trying to influence the outcome?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the VA and to the IG.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the VA has called for, requested the independent inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, and I\'m sure they have no interest in, in any way, doing anything but helping that investigation move forward and get to a conclusion.</p>\n<p>The President is very interested in finding out what happened and instituting and completing this review that Secretary Shinseki initiated.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he asked one of his most trusted advisors to be assigned temporarily to the VA to take on this assignment and to help the Secretary conduct the review.</p>\n<p>But we are very interested in, from the President on down, the completion of both these inquiries -- both the review and the IG\xe2\x80\x99s investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, on Ukraine, Jay -- we\'re a few days out from the presidential elections that is this coming weekend.\xc2\xa0 The OSCE issued a report saying, the rest of the country, fine, they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to go, the election mechanism is in place, et cetera, but in the eastern and southern areas that the turmoil has been happening in, there\xe2\x80\x99s been widespread intimidation of polling workers, not free and fair campaigning.\xc2\xa0 At this point, is there any way Russia avoids sectoral sanctions, or is that a given now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly don\'t have any announcements to make on potential additional sanctions at this time.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that if Russia chooses to undermine the May 25th elections in Ukraine there will be consequences; there will be additional costs, and they will be imposed not just by the United States but our allies and partners, as they have also made clear.</p>\n<p>What I would point you to is that the OSCE thus far has said that in the vast majority of the country they anticipate that the election will go forward and will be free and fair.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that in Donetsk and Luhansk and some other areas, separatists have taken steps that seek to undermine the effective carrying out of the election.\xc2\xa0 And we call on Russia to use its influence to persuade those separatists to stand down and to allow the Ukrainian people to express their will freely.</p>\n<p>What I would also note, and I think others would note, including those from international bodies, is that it is fully possible for Ukraine to conduct an election even as there are some relatively small pockets of problem areas.\xc2\xa0 That is not to say that we condone or countenance the kind of activities that the separatists have engaged in, in violation of the Ukrainian constitution, Ukrainian law, or the efforts that the Russians have engaged in in supporting the separatists.\xc2\xa0 What we hope is that Russia will use its influence in a positive way to allow these elections to take place so that the Ukrainian people can choose for themselves who their president will be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in the meantime, as they have already been doing, the Ukrainian government has begun the process of engaging Ukrainians from across the country, including in the east and the south, in roundtable discussions about constitutional reform and changes that can be made to empower regions and create more autonomy for regions as it relates to the center of the country in Kyiv.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s very positive.\xc2\xa0 And they have kept their word in conducting those roundtables and holding those dialogues.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, again, sends a positive signal about the intentions of the central government in this process and their willingness to resolve these issues peacefully, in a way that\'s consistent with Ukrainian law and with the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the areas where they\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble you have not seen any sign of the Russians doing what you have repeatedly called on them to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t say that -- oh, you mean in terms of using their influence to -- we have yet to see any significant sign that Russia is effectively persuading separatists to vacate buildings, for example, return property to local and regional governments, and to allow the elections to take place.</p>\n<p>Now, there have been statements out of Moscow relating to the disposition of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine that if carried out would be positive.\xc2\xa0 We have yet to see any indication that Russian troops are withdrawing from the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 But we will monitor that closely and certainly hope that the statements of today and yesterday from President Putin and the Russian Defense Minister end up being more than just statements, but presage actual movement by Russian troops away from the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 That would be a positive development.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple things on VA before I take on a couple of other issues.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you said the administration was supportive of the goals of this piece of legislation before the House this week, the Veterans Management Accountability Act. Shinseki is against that, says he has all the authority he needs to punish and deal with those who do not perform up to standards of the Veterans Administration.\xc2\xa0 Does this indicate the White House and the Secretary disagree on what needs to be done as far as accountability within the VA?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, what I said yesterday and what remains true is that the administration shares Congress\xe2\x80\x99s concern about ensuring accountability and effectiveness at the VA and is working to address the problems that have surfaced.\xc2\xa0 And we will closely look at the bill that you mentioned, and as I said, we share the goals and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with Congress to address some concerns that we have with the details of the bill.\xc2\xa0 But the overall issue of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- more does need to be done to give the VA more authority.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned yesterday, the President has already directed Secretary Shinseki to make sure that the VA is making maximum use of its existing authority when it comes to making sure people are held accountable, and also that they\'re assessing whether or not they need additional tools.\xc2\xa0 So we think this is an important issue.\xc2\xa0 We share the concerns that are at the heart of this proposed legislation.\xc2\xa0 We also will work with Congress to address some of the concerns we have with the details of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 But the overall issue of making sure that there are tools in place to hold people accountable at the VA is one that we share.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned many times the need for these investigations to succeed.\xc2\xa0 I was on the phone with Chairman Miller of the Veterans Committee today.\xc2\xa0 He said that he sent a letter right after the news reports in Phoenix surfaced urging the VA to send a cease-and-desist order about the destruction of any documents related to this investigate, and it was eight days before the VA actually sent that order out to the Phoenix office. He\xe2\x80\x99s concerned there and at other places where investigations are underway that the VA is slow to tell people:\xc2\xa0 Preserve all evidence so facts can be determined and accountability can be assessed and carried out.\xc2\xa0 Will you say on behalf of the President that the VA needs to move on this faster, and that in every case where there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation, a cease-and-desist order about not destroying evidence and maintaining everything that the investigators need to see should be done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific order that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly our view and it is Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s view that the VA and its offices needs to cooperate and will cooperate with both the review that Secretary Shinseki has initiated and the investigation that the IG has launched.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s absolute appropriate.</p>\n<p>The President wants to know what happened.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to make sure that any bad behavior is surfaced and that people are held accountable if the problems and the allegations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out there prove to be true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- are expressing fears that evidence is being destroyed, will be destroyed.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That goes to the center of what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do, if you say these investigations are --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If that\'s true, that will be, I expect, a focus of both the review and the independent investigation.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that to be true.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Shinseki has acted immediately to begin the review.\xc2\xa0 He suspended, as I mentioned, the three people in the Phoenix office, the Phoenix facility.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve dispatched the White House Deputy Chief of Staff to assist in the review there, I think which reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus and concern about this.\xc2\xa0 And the Secretary himself called for the IG to launch an independent investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we eagerly await the results of both inquiries.\xc2\xa0 And again, the President expects results and he expects the information that he and the rest of the administration needs in order to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking all the necessary steps to provide the best service we can to our veterans, and to hold accountable any individuals who might have acted poorly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick topics.\xc2\xa0 The House made clear the ENLIST Act will not be on the floor this week or any other time this year.\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest to this White House that all hopes for any even incremental movement on immigration bills out of the House that could form the basis of a conference with the Senate bill are now over?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there is discussion in the House about any element of immigration reform is something we view as a positive.\xc2\xa0 But a bill like that would not in any way fix our broken immigration system or tackle the heart of the problem.\xc2\xa0 We continue to make clear our view that the House should follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead here, take up comprehensive immigration reform either in whole or in pieces as long as the pieces add up to comprehensive immigration reform, and get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they can\'t get the piece that you don\xe2\x80\x99t think moves in that direction, they can\xe2\x80\x99t even do that, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that signal to you this is all but over?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we remain hopeful that there is a window of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Realistically hopeful?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say the odds are overwhelming.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about House Republicans, and they have had a great deal of difficulty confronting this issue. But leaders in the House have noted the importance of addressing immigration reform, noted the importance of the issue to our economy and to matters related to security and accountability.\xc2\xa0 And we remain hopeful that they decide to act and act this year, because the benefits of comprehensive immigration reform are so clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what we hope is that -- I mean, we know they won\xe2\x80\x99t act because the President wants them to act, but they might act because so many others that support comprehensive immigration reform are encouraging them to act.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the business community and law enforcement community and the faith-based community.\xc2\xa0 There are just so many good reasons to do this from so many different political angles, if you will, that we hope that that concentration of energy will compel House Republican leaders to take this up and take advantage of this rare consensus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last topic -- the combatant commanders were here yesterday, and there was a rather large, multi-stakeholder meeting today on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President on deciding ultimate post-2014 troop strength?\xc2\xa0 And where does it stand on the bilateral security agreement in the aftermath of the Afghan elections?\xc2\xa0 These things will soon be coming to a head.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly well into 2014, and our position is what it was and as I discussed in the past, which is that we will evaluate our options when it comes to a post-2014 troop presence dependent upon actions taken by the government in Kabul to sign the BSA.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that process. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that remains under discussion.\xc2\xa0 When the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a decision week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give any timetable for it except to point you to what I said in the past about the options available, the narrow purpose for any remaining -- should there be a remaining troop presence in Afghanistan, what the mission would be, which would be to continue to train and assist Afghan forces and to assist in counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 The military conflict, the war that U.S. forces have engaged in will come to an end at the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 And the decisions about a potential force that would continue in Afghanistan are dependent on a number of issues including the BSA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the VA, Tammy Duckworth is, as you know a wounded war veteran, served in the VA Department earlier in this administration as a Democrat.\xc2\xa0 She said today to The Washington Post, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard, because Mrs. Obama has done so much, Mrs. Biden has done so much, and I see that as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s push on this overall issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And then she went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he has relied on Secretary Shinseki, but we could use his personal attention at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You have a Democrat from the President\xe2\x80\x99s home state saying we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had his personal attention.\xc2\xa0 How do you react to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that the President has provided his personal attention.\xc2\xa0 He has personally instructed that we provide additional resources to the VA.\xc2\xa0 He has personally overseen the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats are not buying it.\xc2\xa0 Even Democrats are saying we need to see him.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that the quote you read backs up what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe could use his personal attention.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you is the personal attention is there.\xc2\xa0 And as I just noted, his senior aide is going to Phoenix tomorrow evening as part of his assignment to assist Secretary Shinseki with that review, which reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus and attention on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we share concerns that have been raised around some of the allegations that have surfaced in recent days.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President wants the Secretary and the IG to conduct their inquiries completely and thoroughly and effectively and quickly, so that we can get to the bottom of what happened, get the results of those inquiries and take action accordingly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You continue to call it \xe2\x80\x9callegations,\xe2\x80\x9d and there are some, but on the other hand, that memo that Jim Acosta was mentioning before from 2010, an internal VA memo said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the memorandum is to call for immediate action to review current scheduling practices to identify and eliminate all inappropriate practices.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So four years ago, they were saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not just allegations, but a top VA official had determined this was going on and they had to immediately take care of it.\xc2\xa0 So will you admit at least that it\xe2\x80\x99s not all allegations, that, in fact, some of this has happened?\xc2\xa0 The VA said it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have made clear that some of the allegations that have emerged in these reports, including the most sensational ones, are under investigation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait to see the results of that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important place to start that no one in this building or anywhere else in the administration, including over at the VA, holds a position that all the challenges that the VA was confronting in 2008 and 2009 have been solved.\xc2\xa0 Far from it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President, as a candidate, spoke about the problems at the VA, spoke about the need to provide necessary resources to the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he send Rob Nabors there in 2010 or 2011?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Ed, this is under investigation and the President wants results.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a memo in 2010 said it was going on -- four years ago.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an internal VA memo.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t share it with anyone over here?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the VA about their internal memos.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the President insists that these investigations go forward and that they come to a conclusion and produce results so that we can evaluate what happened and what action needs to be taken.\xc2\xa0 And I would point to all of those who have, as the President does, a concern about our veterans and the need to provide them the services and benefits that they deserve; to the effort that we have taken and that Congress has responded to in providing the additional funding over and above what was provided in the previous administration\xc2\xa0 -- substantial increases year by year -- and to the steps that, under Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, have been taken to expand the benefits provided to our veterans, expand significantly the number of veterans who are availing themselves of benefits through disability claims and through the Veterans Health Administration, and to say simply that more work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And that is absolutely the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what -- when you say the President is focused on this, has personal attention on it -- next week, you\xe2\x80\x99re having a White House summit on youth sports safety, which is obviously important, dealing with concussions, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Why not next week around Memorial Day have a White House summit on veterans benefits, veterans issues, deaths at hospitals?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would posit a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, the President is actively engaged in the effort to find out what happened related to these allegations in the VA.\xc2\xa0 As I just noted, his top advisor is heading to Phoenix, working with the VA as part of that review.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to proceed on a lot of fronts when it comes to veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits and veterans\xe2\x80\x99 affairs. It is also the case, when it comes to the summit on concussions, that this is a matter of interest to and concern to millions of families across the country.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate to focus some attention on that issue.</p>\n<p>Let me move up and back -- Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the scope of Rob Nabors\xe2\x80\x99 investigation at the VA, is he solely focused on these specific allegations that have come up, or is he looking at the broader, longstanding issues at the VA as well?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just clarify that Rob is not independently investigating.\xc2\xa0 He is helping the Secretary conduct the review that the Secretary initiated.\xc2\xa0 So for the scope of that review, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the VA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Rob is not going over there to deal with any of the other existing issues at the agency, the still long wait times for veterans going back, regardless of whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt to sort of change how those wait times --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think those are fair questions, but I would refer you to the VA, which is obviously the organization we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here and the review that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted is one that has been directed by the Secretary of VA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the case of the IRS, the President put in sort of a -- he had a window I think when they went over there and in terms of when he wanted a report back in terms of those specific allegations.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- has he given the VA a timetable in when he wants to see --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I was asked that and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific timetable.\xc2\xa0 I believe Secretary Shinseki has addressed this question and I would refer you to him and to the VA.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw a Politico story today about the midterm elections, quoting anonymous Democrats saying that the President had what they called \xe2\x80\x9celectoral detachment.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The President has set up no meetings with his political staff and does little beyond headlining events to activate big donors. There\xe2\x80\x99s no strategic direction.\xc2\xa0 The story put this in contrast to Bill Clinton who has had meetings with the DSCC and the DCCC. So my question is, how engaged is the President in the Democratic strategy for these midterm elections?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on what he can do to help Democrats in this midterm cycle.\xc2\xa0 And there are three areas where he can help and where he has been helping and where I think Democrats would attest to the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s been helping.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s ensuring that campaigns and the committees have the financial resources they need -- and I think if you talk to Democrats, they will tell you that he has devoted a significant amount of time to that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He is leveraging his grassroots network -- a network that made him the first person since President Eisenhower to get 51 percent of the vote twice -- and all of the data and technology that comes with it available to 2014 candidates.\xc2\xa0 And of course he is focused on turnout.\xc2\xa0 Midterms, as all you expert political reporters know, are about turnout, getting the base out.\xc2\xa0 And no one is better at doing that than President Obama, at least in the Democratic Party, and so he\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on that.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, what the President, and I think I would say any President, would do in this situation is help set the terms of the debate.\xc2\xa0 And what you see the President doing -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the urgent need to invest in our infrastructure so that we can create jobs today and an economic foundation for the future, which is what he was focused on last week, to what he is focused on this week when it comes to attracting foreign investment into the United States, which helps create high-paying jobs here in the U.S. -- the President is focused on issues that matter to the American people and where, unfortunately often there is a stark contrast with the other party\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda in particular -- an agenda that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the budget that emerged yet again in the House, is focused on providing additional tax cuts to the wealthiest individuals and corporations, that would hike taxes on middle-class families, strip away benefits, voucherize Medicare -- I mean, an economic plan that is not just unpopular but highly dubious as policy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of contrast that I think the President can point out when he is talking about the issues that matter most to the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how intensely focused is he on the midterms?\xc2\xa0 How much time is he going to be devoting to this?\xc2\xa0 This mentions supposedly no meetings with political staff.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that true?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed accounting of his time.\xc2\xa0 The President is primarily focused on the issues and the opportunities related to advancing his agenda on behalf of expanding opportunity for the American people.\xc2\xa0 He strongly believes that setting the terms of the debate on these issues and moving the ball forward, down the field, if you will, when it comes to expanding opportunity, is both good policy and good politics.\xc2\xa0 And that is helpful for Democrats when Republicans choose to oppose some of these very initiatives that help expand the middle class, help grow the economy, reward hard work and provide opportunity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the President is doing the things that I talked about when it comes to making sure that candidates and committees have the financial resources that they need, and providing to them the pretty extraordinary grassroots network that the President amassed in his two campaigns.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 One, there\xe2\x80\x99s reporting today that the First Lady is vowing to fight an effort by Republicans in Congress to roll back some of her healthy school lunch initiatives.\xc2\xa0 How active do we expect the First Lady will be in fighting this legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the First Lady has from day one made the health of our children a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And that means keeping the pressure on to ensure that school nutrition standards already implemented by 90 percent of our schools stay intact.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady and this administration believe that every decision we make should be guided by sound science and hard evidence, not politics or special interests, particularly when it comes to the health of our children.</p>\n<p>So these issues around the health of our children, nutrition issues, have obviously been a top priority for the First Lady since she came here.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work very hard on those and make clear where our priorities should be, which is on our kids\xe2\x80\x99 health and not on politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, a last little bit of housekeeping.\xc2\xa0 The President last year was to give back 10 percent of his -- sorry, 5 percent of his salary to express some solidarity with those who had cutbacks because of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Has he returned that money to the Treasury yet?\xc2\xa0 Has that happened?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the answer to that is yes.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll check for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I call on you already?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not yet.\xc2\xa0 I was just trying to confirm some dates.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It seemed like he asked me a question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- honest answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What do you guys think?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 General Motors today announced I think 2.4 million more cars to be recalled.\xc2\xa0 I think the total year to date is now something like 15 million-plus.\xc2\xa0 Should the U.S. people be disappointed in the lack of transparency by General Motors given the fact that the U.S. people helped bail it out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, these are -- as I think we talked about earlier this week, these are enforcement actions, and I would refer you to DOT and the Highway Safety Transportation Administration for the actions they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with regards to penalties.\xc2\xa0 In terms of decisions by GM itself to recall vehicles, I think, again, that would something that DOT might better address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess given the fact that a lot of these issues sort of bubbled up during the government oversight process when they were considering a bailout, what does it say about the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability in terms of its oversight that none of these things came up during that time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re asking pretty technical questions about the Highway Safety Transportation Administration.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 What I think is absolutely important as a general principle is that every automobile manufacturer, foreign or domestic, be held accountable when it comes to safety matters. But in terms of enforcement of these issues and decisions around recalls, I\'d have to refer you to DOT and to the companies themselves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of how often the President is updated in terms of the breadth of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at General Motors right now?\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has been paid back all the money, so I\'m just trying to get a sense that given $15 million -- it\'s a massive number and that the U.S. was behind the bailout --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have -- I haven\'t had that conversation with him.</p>\n<p>Lesley.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Congressman Lewis yesterday came out against the nomination for Judge Michael Boggs in Georgia.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if the White House is still behind his confirmation.\xc2\xa0 Have you changed anything?\xc2\xa0 And how much -- or how much work can be done with Democrats who have been unhappy with the nomination?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Lesley, because I think we talked about it a lot last week, it is important to understand the process by which nominations come into being.\xc2\xa0 And I explained in some detail how this nomination arose.\xc2\xa0 We have been trying to fill these judicial vacancies for more than three years, but two of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees were blocked for nearly 11 months and were returned at the end of 2011.\xc2\xa0 So our choice is and was clear:\xc2\xa0 Do we work with Republican senators to find a compromise, or do we leave seats vacant?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Four of these vacancies are judicial emergencies, and we believe it would be grossly irresponsible for the President to leave these seats vacant.\xc2\xa0 Judge Michael Boggs was recommended to the Republican by Senators Isakson and Chambliss as part of a compromise to fill a total of six judicial vacancies in Georgia. The two senators have now also agreed to support the President\xe2\x80\x99s nomination of Leslie Abrams to fill a seventh vacancy.\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is a recommendation from the two senators.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that he is qualified for this post.\xc2\xa0 His track record as a state trial and appellate court judge demonstrates that he is qualified for the federal bench, and we obviously support his nomination.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it is important, again, when you report on the general picture here about this nomination and how the process works and the compromises come about, that you have all the details.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Again, with the elections coming up in Ukraine in five days, do you have any insight at all as to who or what entities may, in fact, on election day be at the polls, for example, monitoring the procedures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The OSCE has, as I understand it, dispatched or will dispatch quite a number of election monitors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- international entities, do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The OSCE, I believe -- I don\'t have the demographic breakdown, but individuals from a variety of different countries.\xc2\xa0 I think a relatively small percentage of them are Americans.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s all overseen by the OSCE.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are there NGOs perhaps involved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to ask them, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial number.\xc2\xa0 And they have been monitoring the prelude to the election and the preparatory work the Ukraine has done, and they have given reports on that work and generally very positive reports about work that\'s been undertaken by the Ukrainian government to ensure that there is a free and fair election on May 25th.\xc2\xa0 And they have also reported back, as I think one of your colleagues mentioned earlier, on problems in places like Donetsk and Luhansk, and the impact that separatists have had under the influence of and, unfortunately, with the support of Russia.\xc2\xa0 We continue to call on Russia to use its influence for good, if you will, to allow all Ukrainians the opportunity to vote in a free and fair democratic election on May 25th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to judicial nominations.\xc2\xa0 As you know, David Barron is also held up in the Judiciary Committee.\xc2\xa0 The White House has released the one memo related to the Alawi drone attack.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House plan to release, as some senators have suggested, any and all memos written by David Barron, drone related?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, David Barron is enormously qualified for this judicial post.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a respected member of the Harvard Law School faculty, a former acting assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice, and a former Supreme Court clerk.\xc2\xa0 The administration is working to ensure that any remaining questions members of the Senate have about Mr. Barron\xe2\x80\x99s legal work at the Department of Justice are addressed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Last year, as you know, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee had access to the memo you referred to, and I would note that in his committee vote, Mr. Barron received unanimous Democratic support, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that he will be confirmed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and will serve with distinction.</p>\n<p>I would also note that questions have arisen regarding what materials the administration has made available as the Senate evaluates Mr. Barron\xe2\x80\x99s current nomination.\xc2\xa0 The administration has made available unredacted copies of all written legal advice issued by Mr. Barron regarding the potential use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 And anticipating any question about public release, I would refer you to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 All written legal advice issued by Mr. Barron has been made available to members of the Senate as part of their deliberation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the use of drones against U.S. citizens -- have those members been released or will they be released as well?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re using \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d a little loosely, but I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Made available to the Senate is what I mean, senators.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that all written legal advice issued by Mr. Barron on the issue of potential use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in CT operations has been made available.\xc2\xa0 For more information, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the public release --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 There was obviously a Second Circuit opinion and Justice is evaluating that opinion.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:03 P.M.
