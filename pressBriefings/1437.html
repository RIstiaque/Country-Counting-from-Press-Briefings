EST</p>\n<p><br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Before we get started with a few questions here let me just make one quick scheduling announcement.\xc2\xa0 The President will travel to Lorain County in Ohio on Friday, January 22nd, the next stop on the White House to Main Street tour.\xc2\xa0 During the visit, President Obama will meet with Ohio workers, local CEOs, small business owners, and other local leaders about ideas for continuing to grow the economy and put Americans back to work.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the county --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lorain County in Ohio, January 22, 2010.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Happy New Year.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Happy New Year to you guys.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few questions about security and today\'s meeting.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be unveiling any new steps or policies today, or would you characterize this as a recapping on what the government has done since the incident?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me break up the meeting, which is scheduled for about 2:30 p.m. in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 I think you guys have the participants.\xc2\xa0 The meeting is scheduled now to go almost an hour and a half.\xc2\xa0 At the conclusion of the meeting the President will make a public statement.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think -- not getting ahead of what he\'ll say, I think you\'ll hear the President give a candid update on where we are in the review, outline the specific steps that have been taken to strengthen security in our country, and in particular, our airports, over the past several days, and go through some timelines about additional security announcements that may be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he take questions?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Questions?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, he\'s just making a statement.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So additional steps that may be forthcoming, but not necessarily steps to be announced today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be challenging the agency heads about, in their purview, what went wrong and seeking some accountability there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President requested this review right after the incident that took place on Christmas Day.\xc2\xa0 Many of those reports -- the reports have come in; some have -- one agency\'s came in a little bit late because of an incident that happened that you all are aware of.\xc2\xa0 The President has had an opportunity to review those initial reports with Mr. Brennan in the Oval Office for about an hour yesterday, along with other members of his national security team here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President\'s statement over the break, and he\'s -- the President has a series of questions that he\'s asked all of us to look into.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll start going through those questions and looking for answers that are satisfactory to him and to the American people.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk within the White House, to the degree you can speak about this, about any kind of military response against suspected terrorist-training facilities in Yemen, for example?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into information like that. Obviously, you should pose also that question to the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 I think suffice to say, and you\'ve seen this over the past several weeks, we are strongly supportive of the efforts by the Yemeni government to take strong action and root out terrorists that are members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll continue to do so and continue to be supportive of those efforts.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has come back from the holiday with quite a bit on his plate, and now --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He left with quite a bit on his plate, so yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Still there on his return.\xc2\xa0 Now counterterrorism has shot up the list and taken greater prominence than anyone would have expected because of the bomb plot.\xc2\xa0 The question is, is there any concern within the administration that this may distract him from his other domestic priorities such as jobs, economic recovery, and health care?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 First of all, let\'s understand -- the President understands and believes wholeheartedly that keeping the American people safe and secure is his first job.\xc2\xa0 Nobody here would ever describe that as any sort of distraction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think if you look at -- and you\'ll hear the President discuss this today\xc2\xa0 -- the actions that we have supported in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Somalia, as I just mentioned to Ben, in Yemen, are not things that have happened since the 25th of December; those things were happening -- have been happening for quite some time. So the notion that somehow this got put on the President\'s plate in the intervening 10 days I think is something -- given the amount of time that he\'s spent working on these issues, I don\'t think I would agree that somehow this is something that\'s been put on his plate over the last few days.\xc2\xa0 These are obviously threats, and places in the world that are supportive of terrorists and terrorist organizations have been something the President has been dealing with since the transition, before he was even sworn in.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, arguably, the President would come back from the holidays to deal with things like job creation, economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 He spent his first day back yesterday and a large chunk today in meetings that are very intensive meetings about how to fix the problems on --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But my point would be, Matt, that I don\'t think that -- we didn\'t have a mindset that this problem didn\'t exist prior to December 25th.\xc2\xa0 The President spends, as you know, each day getting a daily intelligence update --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is saying that.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying you blew it.\xc2\xa0 There was no coordination.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helen, let me just answer -- let me just answer Matt\'s question and then we\'ll get to your question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has spent part of every day since he\'s been here working on terrorism, working on terrorist threats, working on dealing with extremists.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about Afghanistan; we\'ve talked about Pakistan; we\'ve talked about many of these issues.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t quibble with the fact that the President has a full plate.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that you would find that the -- the President wouldn\'t find his plate altogether a lot fuller than it was, quite honestly, just a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 He\'s used to carrying around an otherwise full plate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the measures, the reforms that the President and the administration are talking about, including tighter security, more stringent safeguards on visas, people being added to the selectee and no-fly lists, and other things having to do with challenging intelligence assumptions -- can you look at Abdulmutallab\'s path from Yemen to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Amsterdam, to Detroit, and show us, tell us how these new reforms would have perhaps detected him along that path?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me not get into that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will begin to get into that some today and in the coming days as the review continues and wraps up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what you\'ll hear, again, from the President -- part of what you\'ll hear from the President today was -- is to go into a number of steps that we have taken but also to walk people through the systemic failure that the President pointed out had happened in his remarks last week.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also in his remarks mentioned human failure.\xc2\xa0 And so far, as far as I know, nobody has lost their job or been reprimanded.\xc2\xa0 Not to take on Admiral Blair, but it is the job of the Director of National Intelligence -- specifically that job was created to connect the dots.\xc2\xa0 Is anybody at all going to lose their job over this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jake, the review is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear the President begin to address aspects of that review today.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is anxious to sit down --\xc2\xa0 he\'s obviously spoken with a number of these individuals over the course of the many days and is anxious to sit down with them as a group and walk through this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has discussed ensuring that adequate steps are taken to ensure the American people\'s safety, and that\'s what he\'ll be discussing and working through today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final question, if I may.\xc2\xa0 How cooperative has Abdulmutallab been after he was arrested and since he got a lawyer?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The subject, as you know, was taken from the plane in Detroit.\xc2\xa0 FBI interrogators spent quite some time with him.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into all the specifics, but I think they would agree and I would say that he has provided in those interrogations useful intelligence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since he got a lawyer, anything?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into all of what he said, but again, I think the interrogators have believed that he has provided them with useful intelligence.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 What would the President say to the American people who have deep concerns that some of the same questions that are being asked now were asked after 9/11?\xc2\xa0 All these years later obviously there\'s been some breakdown, communication breakdown, information-sharing, within the intelligence community.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will get into some of that today.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people will hear directly from their President today on some of those failures.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get too far ahead of the review itself.\xc2\xa0 I think there are some substantive differences from what we saw in the pre-9/11 days that have, and were, addressed between that incident over the past eight years.\xc2\xa0 There are --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is some skepticism, though --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- hold on a second -- I think while there are some -- while this involves intelligence, I think some of the problems are not completely analogous to -- you\'ll hear the President talk about that, I think you heard John talk about that over the weekend, and I think -- the President\'s charge in these reviews, both in the watch listing and in the detection capabilities review that\'s being done by the Department of Homeland Security -- the President is as frustrated as I\'m sure many American people are.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve spent a lot of money in the intervening years.\xc2\xa0 We have set up new positions, we\'ve stood up new agencies, so to speak.\xc2\xa0 We have to ensure, and I think the President will strive to do so, to reassure the American people that all that can be done is and will be done in order to protect them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on health care.\xc2\xa0 CSPAN television is requesting leaders in Congress to open up the debate to their cameras, and I know this is something that the President talked about on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that he supports, will be pushing for?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that letter.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is going to begin some discussions later today on health care in order to try to iron out the differences that remain between the House and the Senate bill and try to get something hopefully to his desk quite quickly.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Helen.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Before Pearl Harbor the Navy didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to the Army, the War Department didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to\xc2\xa0 -- was there a lack of coordination on all the security information we\'ve had?\xc2\xa0 And what is the core reason you think -- or your President thinks for terrorism?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s your President, too, Helen, so --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do I think?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, you asked me about my President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought it was our President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I agree.\xc2\xa0 You just -- you added a "y" to "our" and somehow came up with "your."\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'m sorry, I interrupted your question --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- think there is any coordination -- don\'t they have a coordination failing on intelligence?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, building on what I just talked about with Dan, I think the President said quite clearly there was a systemic intelligence failure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Breakdown.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss that more today and what the review has preliminarily shown, and will begin to go through some of the things that we have done as well as -- the team will begin to work through all the additional steps that the team and the President believe must be taken to ensure the safety and security of the American people -- that, as I said to Dan, I don\'t think when we get through to the review and -- I don\'t think it\'s completely analogous to some of the walls that the bureaucracy had constructed prior to 9/11.\xc2\xa0 I think some of that obviously has been knocked down and there is a greater amount of information-sharing, and there\'s a greater amount of sheer intelligence that\'s collected.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President wants to know where the systemic failure happened and what we\'re going to do to ensure that we can do everything in our power to make sure it doesn\'t happen again.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear the President talk about that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think that\'s possible?\xc2\xa0 And also, what is the core reason of why they want to blow us up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I\'m the best person to speak for some of their actions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have information, you said.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think that for whatever awful and murderous reason that people seek to get on planes and do innocent people throughout the world harm, I can\'t speak to the type of deranged mentality that leads somebody to do that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t know who is motivating all this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can certainly name a few of them.\xc2\xa0 I think the President, though, his job is to in this instance do all that we can to ensure that every step is taken to prevent it from happening in our airlines.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That isn\'t answering my question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe then I misunderstood your question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the core reason?\xc2\xa0 Has the administration decided why these people --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a number of reasons.\xc2\xa0 And I think they have stated in various messages and videos all sorts of reasoning for why they seek to do what they do.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think any of it in any way would ever rationalize the actions of what we saw on Christmas Day.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to return to her original question.\xc2\xa0 There are some people who believe that the only reason this was not a catastrophic disaster was luck, that Abdulmutallab screwed up in making this device work.\xc2\xa0 And, as Helen said, a lot of people believe the President and his administration simply blew it.\xc2\xa0 Would you agree with that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I\'m going out on a limb to say the President has said there was a systemic intelligence failure, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How bad -- the average person would say they just blew it.\xc2\xa0 Is that going too far?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the substantive difference between the two are.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so it\'s the same thing, basically.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President quite clearly said that a failure of our intelligence service happened -- intelligence services happened in allowing what we saw on Christmas Day to potentially transpire.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I think the President said that about a week ago.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President take any personal blame for that?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that he did not pay enough attention to these issues in his first year in office?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- I don\'t think that\'s the case, no.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fact that he had this incredibly full plate did not, as you say, distract him from spending the time needed?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve spent an awful lot of time talking about\xc2\xa0 -- you\'ve asked me a lot of questions, most of which I can\'t answer on camera, about different activities, and the President\xc2\xa0 -- nothing has distracted the President from keeping us safe.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Hawaii, a lot of people -- well, while he was in Hawaii a lot of people back here, critics, accused him -- his initial response of being slow and weak and said he should have come home from Hawaii and dealt with this thing on a full-time basis.\xc2\xa0 What does he feel about that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You were in Hawaii, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I recall you guys being somewhat busy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were a bit busy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President worked on this throughout his time in Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 He worked on it before he left and he\'s worked on it since he\'s come back.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about that idea, though, that it was -- his initial response, waiting three days, was slow; his first statement was kind of matter-of-fact, as people said.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It keeps pundits employed, but I don\'t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one other question on privacy?\xc2\xa0 On full-body scan, how important is privacy in all of this?\xc2\xa0 Do you think -- does the President believe the American people just have to get used to the fact that they\'re going to have to undergo these embarrassing procedures?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the administration believes -- and I would point you specifically to DHS on this -- that we can easily achieve a balance that allows us not to give up our privacy but at the same time protects us from those that seek to do us harm.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few follow-ups just on everything.\xc2\xa0 First on the -- a follow-up to Ben\'s question about ruling out -- ruling in or out military -- U.S. military intervention in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the President\'s position during the campaign -- for instance, on Pakistan, which was, if they don\'t act, we will -- that\'s his position when it comes to all things al Qaeda?\xc2\xa0 And so that could be regardless of country, regardless of border?\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to assume that the President\'s position is the same?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to draw blanket -- I don\'t want to parse your question, but at the same time -- suffice to say this government and this administration makes use of actionable intelligence.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so when it comes to al Qaeda and Pakistan, there\'s no reason to think that Yemen -- I know you don\'t want to -- there\'s no reason to think --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I think I answered Ben\'s question.\xc2\xa0 You understand that I\'m not going to get into what we do with actionable intelligence.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on Jake\'s question about Abdulmutallab lawyering up.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been reported that he has not\xc2\xa0 -- he\'s clammed up over the last few days.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that if he were an enemy combatant that they\'d still be able to get intelligence out of him?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Abdulmutallab spent a number of hours with FBI investigators in which we gleaned useable actionable intelligence.\xc2\xa0 A decision was made in this case similar to previous decisions that have been made with Richard Reid, with Zacarias Moussaoui, with Jose Padilla.\xc2\xa0 The FBI investigators believed they got useful information from this terrorist, and I don\'t see, despite what you hear otherwise, I don\'t see -- I honestly don\'t see the point that is being made when you look at past decisions that were made by other administrations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the FBI got actionable intelligence.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And you know I\'m not going to go into talking about what --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 Well, can you at least say, without saying what it is, can you say have there been plans implemented since you received this intelligence?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into -- I think it would be a bad precedent for me to set to begin to discuss that intelligence from here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally on the meeting today, is the President going to be issuing to the intelligence folks in particular -- I mean, I understand this is sort of two parts here, the security\xc2\xa0 -- homeland security aspect of this and the intelligence-gathering aspect -- is he going to, after receiving these reviews, at least to all of them -- how is he going to make sure that the review process continues, I guess?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he setting benchmarks that he\'s going to, like, be saying, look, I want to know that this is happening now --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the review will end today.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll have more on this in the next few days.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- one part of your question -- I don\'t think the President -- I think what we have to do is make sure that we\'re not in the mindset of looking at homeland security and intelligence as two different silos.\xc2\xa0 I think what Dan and what Helen have said is -- and what this review the President has asked us to concentrate on -- is to ensure that that information can move across, that it -- I think the problems that were gotten into pre-9/11, 2001 were information that were in silos and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be -- couldn\'t go across, and I think clearly that\'s one of the things the President is going to delve into.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it does seem as if -- that you believe there -- that the systemic failure and human failures happened more on the intelligence side, more so than on the security side of things.\xc2\xa0 Is that fair?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 Though I will say this:\xc2\xa0 Again, one of the things -- again, you know the President has two reviews.\xc2\xa0 One of those reviews is a detections capability review based on substances and this individual getting on this plane with what he had.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First, the British government yesterday and today said that they have passed on the information about Abdulmutallab and his time in Britain to U.S. intelligence. Do you have any comment on that?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any description of the nature of that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Like I said to Chuck, I\'m not going to get into intelligence matters as in the review -- as well as discussing that aspect of the ongoing review.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And second, we know from these agencies already that a lot of these reports were them saying they weren\'t to blame, somebody else was to blame.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, this is based on?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on people from those agencies saying, well, our report basically says that we are -- and Secretary Clinton yesterday said --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this.\xc2\xa0 Let me short-circuit your question.\xc2\xa0 A week ago, the President went out and said we had a systemic failure.\xc2\xa0 When the President did that, the President -- we\'re going to move beyond agency finger-pointing.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to break down whatever silos exist from information being collected and shared.\xc2\xa0 That came from the President.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody should misunderstand how that should flow to each and every agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a far more serious game than trying to figure out which agency can blame which other agency.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the point. The point in this is to take every conceivable and knowable action to ensure that what we collect is processed -- that as it\'s gathered, it\'s processed, and that it\'s used to prevent something like this from happening.\xc2\xa0 The President will ensure, and I can assure you today, that the President will discuss this in the Situation Room.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will not find acceptable a response where everybody gets in a circle and points at somebody else.\xc2\xa0 The American people won\'t accept that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little bit on what the President intends to talk about with Democratic leaders this afternoon?\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be an actual negotiation?\xc2\xa0 Are they just trying to set up a process for considering the health bills?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- we\'ll have a few sentences of a readout afterwards.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they will talk about -- look, I think in terms of talking about health care, they\'ll talk about the great vast majority of the two bills that coincide, and we will I think begin to talk through how we work out what limited number of differences there are.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s been some talk of not having a formal conference committee on Capitol Hill, to just sort of do this informally, probably behind closed doors.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a view about whether this should be an actual conference committee or just be negotiated out?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is anxious to get the differences worked out and get a bill to both houses and passed out of them.\xc2\xa0 I think you can go back and look through the past many years and see where situations -- where they work out the differences between two bills -- it happens very similarly to what the President is engaged in now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just lastly, why can\'t you answer the C-SPAN question --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you didn\'t, because you said --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said I hadn\'t seen the letter, which I haven\'t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you need to see a letter?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is something the President said during the campaign and he talked about he wants everything open on C-SPAN --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan asked me about the letter and I haven\'t read the letter.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll just ask you about having it on C-SPAN --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I answered Dan\'s question and I answered this before we left for the break, Keith.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s number-one priority is getting the differences worked out, getting a bill to the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve filled your newspaper and many others with the back-and-forth and the details of what\'s in these bills.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to keep that from continuing to happen.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s anybody that would say that we haven\'t had a thorough, robust, now spanning two calendar years\' debate on health care.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of reasons not to do it on C-SPAN -- people could showboat.\xc2\xa0 Does he regret making that statement during the campaign?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Julianna.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the agencies finger-pointing, but does the President feel like, yet, that he can conclude which agencies dropped the ball more than others?\xc2\xa0 And can we expect to hear that later today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be candid about what we\'ve found.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the coming days we\'ll have more on what happened and why.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he still -- going back to Jake\'s question, does he still have full confidence in Blair and Panetta?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 And the President will -- and those agencies will continue to take part in this review process and we\'ll continue to find out what happened.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last question.\xc2\xa0 Friday is the next jobs report. I\'m not going to ask you to guess what\'s going to happen, but --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The last time I did that, the market went haywire.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President have --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- I need a short-stock --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just write down what I say, not what you thought I\'d say.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the past few months, though, around the jobs report, the President has had events, either the jobs summit or the Allentown event.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything planned this week around that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that there\'s a specific -- the President will make comments about the report.\xc2\xa0 I have not looked through the block schedule, but I don\'t -- there\'s no travel that\'s planned for that day.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or anything here, any sort of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, he will do a statement and respond to the jobs report.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said he would hold people accountable.\xc2\xa0 Can you define what that will be and how the American people will know it\'s happened?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I think I discussed this earlier.\xc2\xa0 This is -- accountability is part of the ongoing review.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll hear the President talk about where we are in that review process as that review continues.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does accountability necessarily mean someone needs to lose their job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of the end of the review.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s possible that accountability would not include someone losing -- that doesn\'t have to be a necessary measure of it.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to wait for the review to take -- to finish and announcements to come after that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also said that there were pieces of information that had they have been put together would have prevented the suspect from getting on the plane.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan said Sunday a couple of times that there was no smoking gun.\xc2\xa0 Can you help the American people understand that, those two statements?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what you heard the President say and what you heard John say are the same in that -- and you\'ll hear more of this from the President and as this review transpires -- information in different places collected but not analyzed and shared as it should have been added up could have, as the President said he believes, prevented this individual from getting on an airplane.\xc2\xa0 Was there -- I think what John was saying, was there one piece of all of this in one location in two or three sentences?\xc2\xa0 I think what John said, the answer to that is no.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is not a matter of inept gathering, it was the speed with which it was -- it should have been shared, is that fair?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will address this directly today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, I just want to round out this conversation.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the standard that he set during the campaign -- and it was more than once, you and I heard it several times --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Three, I think.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It got favorable crowd reaction every time.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe the standard that he set during the campaign of an open dialogue in which the American public can evaluate around any kind of table or with any kind of cameras present dialoging back and forth on health care has been met --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- therefore, there is no need to go down this road?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the American people have -- I do not believe the American people have lacked for information on what\'s in these bills, the political and policy arguments around different people\'s position.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s been well documented.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, let me put it this way.\xc2\xa0 What\'s going to be determined in these negotiations is the final product; not what one body of the legislature believes is necessary and the other disagrees with, but what the final implication will be for the American public.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that final implication of that product will then go to the House, where 435 sworn members will debate and discuss and ultimately vote on.\xc2\xa0 Then that final implication of the product will go to the Senate, where 100 equally sworn members will debate and discuss that topic.\xc2\xa0 And then hopefully it will come to the White House in an intervening time period where I assume that product will be debated and discussed before the President signs it into law.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But before reaching the House and Senate floors the public doesn\'t need, in the White House opinion, to see it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you can get a sense of where -- you have at least the property lines of what we\'re talking about because one set is in the House bill, one set is in the Senate bill, and it\'s different policy proposals that we\'ve been talking about since it was a lot warmer outside than it is now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we started back when it was cold, and then it got warm and now it\'s cold again.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Flight 253.\xc2\xa0 You said this was an intelligence agency -- intelligence agencies failed.\xc2\xa0 Did the State Department fail in any way?\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Secretary Clinton said, "We met all the interagency requirements."\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with a response like that, that interagency requirements were met, therefore everything is okay?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me do this -- I don\'t want to single out -- you\'ll hear the President speak about this review later.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not -- I think when the President talked about systemic failure he does not absolve any agency in this process as our review looks through what happened.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, if --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should an agency know that if they say, we followed all our necessary procedures and this still happened, that\'s good enough?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say this, let me say -- if everybody had done everything that they could, I think you\'ll hear the President -- you\'ve heard him say and I think you\'ll hear him say again, that we wouldn\'t be discussing Flight 253 on Christmas Day.\xc2\xa0 And until -- unless or until we can be convinced that we\'re doing everything in our power to ensure that we\'re taking those steps, the President will not stop asking questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow up on that.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t one of the problems the fact that some people were abiding by protocols and those protocols are inadequate?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question, and I think one of the things that -- I mean, we talked about this in the initial days afterwards.\xc2\xa0 We have -- one of the reasons why the President has asked for John specifically to go through this watch listing, there are -- there\'s a TIDES database -- there is a terrorist screening database from which TIDES is a larger pool that is drawn into this terrorism screening database; from the terrorism screening database, a subset of that makes up the selectee and ultimately the no-fly list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have to ensure that protocols that have been in place and developed since -- for many, many years, don\'t prevent either information-gathering or information-sharing so that somebody that\'s on the TIDES list can\'t go to the screening -- the database screening list and ultimately to selectee and no-fly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear the President talk about -- had all this information that is gathered and collected been fully analyzed, I think the President -- you heard him say and he\'ll reiterate that what somebody -- what started in the TIDES database, which is a sort of global record system of individuals of concern, doesn\'t get birthed up into something like the selectee and the no-fly list.\xc2\xa0 There are no doubt that we have to examine the existing protocols as the tactics and techniques of terrorists change to ensure that we are staying ahead of what they\'re planning.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is one of the goals to make that a real-time procedure, meaning -- let\'s say you\'re not on the no-fly list but you\'re maybe in TIDE, and there is something about your presentation at the airport -- cash, one-way, no luggage -- that instantly pushes you up the system --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that the theoretical goal --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- something that has a real-time component to it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- what John Brennan will do is look through the different protocols, the different ways that information is gathered, and how we move people from TIDES to screening, ultimately to selectee and no-fly.\xc2\xa0 Look, some of the reasons -- I think you heard John say, cash that\'s used in Africa to buy a plane ticket may not altogether --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not necessarily --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right -- isn\'t necessarily going to be something where somebody says, oh, wait a minute, that individual should -- now, that plus a series of other things all analyzed together could, and should, take somebody from a larger pool into a selectee or a no-fly.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt about that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you describe how the attempted bombing is affecting the administration\'s thinking about Guantanamo Bay and closing the facility?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, first and foremost, we have undergone a rigorous process to analyze all that were at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Some have been transferred to their home countries, some to other countries either because they -- the task force determined that it was okay to do so, or in some cases judges have ruled in habeas cases that the government no longer has an acceptable reason for keeping that individual.\xc2\xa0 Again, the task force will look through those.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously worked through legislation to reform military commissions.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve indicted individuals in Article III courts, and some of those trials will begin soon.\xc2\xa0 And I think you heard John say this over the weekend, that one of the very first things that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula used as a recruiting tool was the existence of Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 John has stated clearly that we are not going to make decisions about transfers that -- to a country like Yemen that would -- that they\'re not capable of handling.\xc2\xa0 And I think that while we remain committed to closing the facility, the determination has been made that right now any additional transfers to Yemen is not a good idea.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow on that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because that potentially moves up the number of people that might be sent to the Thomson prison.\xc2\xa0 Can you --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t quantify -- again, what I just said to Michael -- obviously we\'re not -- we would not move additional people into Yemen right now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will not?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said the -- if the protocols were inadequate and these things are being reviewed, should Americans be fearful of flying, either domestically or internationally?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because -- well, I believe that the system that we have right now, the enhanced security procedures that have been implemented, provide a measure of safety and security for travelers either going domestically or traveling to and from this country overseas.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll hear the President discuss today what has been done through DHS and TSA for additional screening activities and different security protocols to ensure that safety.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate matter, on the Fort Hood review, does the President plan to make a statement on his assessment of the review that was presented to him in Hawaii?\xc2\xa0 And will that review ever become public?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President received from John, on the 23rd, prior to leaving, some -- a preliminary investigation into that.\xc2\xa0 I know they discussed some of that while he was there and have discussed that since coming back, and I know at some point we will finish that review and make it public.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At some point will he make a statement on that, though, on his assessment or --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think so.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, we\'re focused on the meeting and the assessment today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on the third uninvited state dinner guest.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\'s reaction to learning that there was yet another one?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\'m not going to get into this -- yesterday we directed, and we will do so today, based on a criminal investigation, direct you to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that affect the criminal investigation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just -- because I\'ve talked to the lawyers and that\'s the recommendation that was given to me.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that both your questions?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there were a couple of others that are not part of a criminal investigation --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if it\'s that incident, then I\'ll --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just follow on this one, please?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, does the President make any decision to delist North Korea as terrorist country?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say that one more time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President make any decision to delist North Korea as terrorist country?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Delist.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Has the President made a decision?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Our posture on that has not changed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today marks one year exactly since the President nominated Dawn Johnsen to lead the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to renominate her and the others?\xc2\xa0 And more broadly speaking, how does he respond to criticisms from liberal organizations that he hasn\'t put enough muscle behind getting his judicial and executive branch nominees confirmed?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what decisions have been made about nominees that have, as a result of being -- having passed a year, need to be renominated.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say that we are proud of our record of getting individuals into government, though disappointed at the pace in the Senate in working through both executive branch and judicial nominations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that the President had full confident in Admiral Blair and Director Panetta, correct?\xc2\xa0 Does he have the same confident in Secretary Napolitano?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there has been no sounding out of people outside the administration to wait in the wings for a possible shakeup?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing I wanted to ask was, do the intelligence chiefs who were -- who have been meeting with the President, do they feel the interrogators had enough time with Abdulmutallab before the lawyers came in?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s my understanding the FBI does believe so, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the CIA and NSA --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked directly to them.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly look into that.\xc2\xa0 But again, if you look at decisions that were made about Richard Reid, if you -- Richard Reid, after I think less than three days, had already been indicted, which puts him in the criminal justice here.\xc2\xa0 He was tried in Boston and is now at a maximum security facility in Florence, Colorado. The same is true for Zacarias Moussaoui.\xc2\xa0 He entered the U.S. criminal justice system, and convicted not far from here and sent to Colorado, as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, was the President, before December 25th, was the President ever briefed by things like the TIDES list and how that works, or airport security, or did he ever ask?\xc2\xa0 Was he assured that all this worked ever before this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the full answer to the degree to which they had gotten into the TIDES database or that.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly see if -- obviously the President spends a lot of time learning about and discussing potential threats.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any response to the effigy that was found in Georgia?\xc2\xa0 And are there any concerns about increased demonstrations like these happening against the President?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d point you to the Secret Service on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Thirteen state attorney generals sent a letter to congressional leaders saying that if a Nebraska clause isn\'t in the final health care bill that they would bring legal action, based on equal protection clause and arbitrary spending.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe the Nebraska clause is constitutional if it meets the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to the President specifically about the letter from the attorney generals.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that -- I do not believe that anybody has legitimate constitutional concerns about the legislation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he supportive of the Nebraska language then --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s supportive of the Senate bill, so I don\'t know what that leads you to conclude.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the Christmas Day incident involving Flight 253 there\'s been increase scrutiny upon people flying into this country from 14 mostly Muslim countries.\xc2\xa0 I\'m curious -- I\'ve heard this from many people -- why did it take eight-plus years post-9/11 to get to this point as far as increased scrutiny on those individuals flying into those countries?\xc2\xa0 And also, will this continue for the foreseeable future?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, DHS and TSA have put into place for that foreseeable future enhanced security.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not chosen by -- they\'re chosen by what have been determined as state sponsors of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how that list currently has been and in other ways has been devised in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should this have happened, like, a lot earlier -- I mean, post-9/11 -- just to get to this point where we are right now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not all 14, Robert.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only four --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will double-check on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Deb.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President play any role in John Cherry\'s decision not to run for governor of Michigan?\xc2\xa0 And is the White House playing any role now in talking to Democratic candidates about running?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with -- none that I\'m aware of in the decision by the lieutenant governor today.\xc2\xa0 And I can check with Political Affairs about something ongoing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ken.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Robert, Chairman Charlie Rangel of Ways and Means suggests that the conference will be just this side of a rubber stamp.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specific that the President would like to see be included at this point in a final conference bill?\xc2\xa0 And does the President accept that at this point this will just be pretty much a quick run-through?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, we\'ve discussed in here over the course of many months what will ultimately be or what is ultimately part of the few differences in each one of those bills.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President will, and leaders on both the House and Senate side, will go through.\xc2\xa0 Again, we hope this is a process that because of the sheer nature of how much in these bills are -- these bills have in common, that this is a process that we can conclude and ultimately get a bill quickly to the President\'s desk.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:19 P.M.
