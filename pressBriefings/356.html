EST</p>\n<p>MS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much for joining this background call on policy changes to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 This call will be embargoed until the end of the call.\xc2\xa0 We will lift the embargo at the end of the call, so you cannot report anything that you hear on this call until the call is concluded.\xc2\xa0 At that point, you may quote officials on the call as senior administration officials only, not by name.\xc2\xa0 We will also lift the embargo on the factsheet that the White House released this morning at the end of this call.</p>\n<p>So again, at the end of the call you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to report on background anything you hear on this call as well as quote from the factsheet, but not before this call is over.</p>\n<p>We have seven senior administration officials with us today from across the interagency.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will turn it over to senior administration official number one.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start by walking you through the overview of what we will be announcing today, and then my colleagues can fill in some of the details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First of all, these steps will be the most significant changes to our Cuba policy in more than 50 years.\xc2\xa0 The President, when he came into office, was committed to changing a policy that we felt had failed to advance our interests for the last several decades by promoting greater openness with Cuba and facilitating greater access for the Cuban people to economic opportunity and to the type of relations with the United States that can ultimately empower the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>In that vein, the President, as you know, authorized, for instance, Cuban Americans to be able to travel to the island and to send remittances to their family on the island.\xc2\xa0 We received very positive feedback from those initial policy changes.\xc2\xa0 And the President was committed to pursuing additional steps through his time in office.</p>\n<p>However, we had a significant impediment to our ability to pursue additional policy changes with the imprisonment -- wrongful imprisonment of Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor in Cuba, for over five years now.</p>\n<p>So, first, let me walk you through Alan\xe2\x80\x99s release and an exchange of intelligence assets that took place today before getting into the policy changes.\xc2\xa0 Importantly, we did pursue a swap, an exchange of intelligence assets, including the return of the three Cubans who remained jailed in the United States from the so-called Cuban Five Wasp Network.\xc2\xa0 They were returned to Cuba this morning.\xc2\xa0 In exchange, the Cubans released a U.S. intelligence asset who has been imprisoned in Cuba for nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 The identity of this asset will remain secret, but we can provide you with some information about his importance to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this individual was responsible for some of the most important intelligence and counterintelligence prosecutions that the United States has been able to pursue in recent decades.\xc2\xa0 For instance, he provided the information that led to the identification and conviction of Defense Intelligence Agency senior analyst, Ana Belen Montes; former Department of State official, Walter Kendall Myers and his spouse, Gwendolyn Myers; and members of the Wasp Network in Florida, including the so-called Cuban Five.\xc2\xa0 So again, this intelligence asset, who was a part of this exchange, provided information that led to the prosecution in part of the Cuban Five.\xc2\xa0 So his return was particularly important to us.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Cuba agreed to release Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 And Alan was flown back -- is currently flying back to the United States with his wife, Judy.\xc2\xa0 Again, we believe Alan was wrongfully imprisoned, and we overwhelmed with joy that Alan will be reunited with his family, particularly in this holiday season of Hanukkah.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, the exchange was the three Cubans who have been imprisoned in the United States for the U.S. intelligence asset who\xe2\x80\x99s been imprisoned in Cuba for nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 And then the Cuban government released Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds.</p>\n<p>With that issue resolved, the President is now going to be announcing very significant changes to our Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0 What we are doing is beginning the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give the overview of these steps, and then my colleagues can fill in some details.</p>\n<p>First, we will be immediately initiating discussions with Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since 1961.\xc2\xa0 And so we will enter into discussions with Cuba about reestablishing an embassy in Havana, and we will be initiating high-level contacts and visits with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We do so in the belief that there are significant issues where we\xe2\x80\x99d benefit from cooperation, like our current efforts to fight Ebola, where Cuba has dispatched hundreds of health care workers to Africa, but also issues like migration, counterterrorism, drug trafficking, disaster response, where practical cooperation can serve the interests of the United States and Cuba.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we fully expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have strong differences, particularly on issues related to democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 The United States will continue to promote our values.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to support civil society in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue our democracy programming.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, the fact that we are reestablishing diplomatic relations is, frankly, a better way in our view of advancing our interests and our values.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has long believed that engagement is a better tool than isolation, and nowhere is that clearer than in Cuba where we have seen a policy of isolation fail for the last 50 years in advancing American interests and values on the island.</p>\n<p>Second, the President has instructed Secretary Kerry to review Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 So that process will be initiated and has to go through a formal review so that we are guided by the facts and the law in making that determination.</p>\n<p>Third, we are taking a number of steps to significantly increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And we do this on the premise that it does not make sense to impose restrictions on the American people and on American businesses that disadvantage the freedom of Americans to travel or the ability of U.S. businesses to operate in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And so those -- the steps that we are taking will facilitate greater activity for U.S. persons and businesses, but also, importantly, we believe that by further opening up to Cuba, we will be able to promote openness and reform in Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There have been some incremental reforms taken in Cuba in recent years, but clearly we believe that more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 Again, however, we believe that openness is a better policy than isolation in advancing the things that we care about in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So there will be greater people-to-people engagement and travel opportunity.\xc2\xa0 There will be the ability for the American people to use credit and debit cards when they travel to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be increasing significantly the amount of money that can be sent to Cuba through remittances.\xc2\xa0 We will, again, be facilitating increased transactions, including U.S. financial institutions being allowed to open accounts in Cuban financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 And we will be authorizing increased telecommunications connections between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 All of these policy changes my colleagues can go through in greater detail.</p>\n<p>In addition, the United States will be participating at the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year, and Cuba will be participating as well.\xc2\xa0 We are not objecting to Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s participation at the summit.\xc2\xa0 We are making clear that we believe that democracy and human rights have to be on the agenda at the summit; that civil society has to be included at the summit.</p>\n<p>But I would note that in all of his engagements with Latin American leaders, the President has consistently heard of the importance of taking the kind of steps that he is taking today, which we believe will be strongly welcomed across the hemisphere.</p>\n<p>Let me just go through a couple other points before turning to my colleagues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of how we got to where we are today, the President authorized a high-level channel of communication with the Cuban government last spring.\xc2\xa0 The individuals on the U.S. side who participated in that channel are Ben Rhodes and Ricardo Zu\xc3\xb1iga, the Senior Director for Western Hemisphere here at the National Security Council.</p>\n<p>There were multiple meetings with Cuban officials that took place in third countries; I\xe2\x80\x99ll just identify the two principal ones.\xc2\xa0 Canada hosted the majority of these meetings, and I want to thank the Canadian government for providing its good offices and hosting our discussions with the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 Canada did not participate in the substance of the discussions, but they were indispensable in providing a venue and support for these efforts.</p>\n<p>Second, and very importantly, the Vatican played a role in this as well.\xc2\xa0 Pope Francis personally issued an appeal through a letter that he sent to President Obama and to President Raul Castro, calling on them to resolve the case of Alan Gross and the cases of the three Cubans who have been imprisoned here in the United States, and also encouraging the United States and Cuba to pursue a closer relationship.\xc2\xa0 The Vatican then hosted the U.S. and Cuban delegations where we were able to review the commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99re making today in terms of the exchange of assets, in terms of the release of Alan Gross, and also in terms of some of the other changes in our relations that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also note that the Cuban government has made some additional decisions.\xc2\xa0 These are sovereign decisions of the Cuban government that we have welcomed.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, the Cuban government agreed to release 53 prisoners whose cases we brought to their attention.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals that we believe are political prisoners, and we welcome very much their release.\xc2\xa0 A number of those individuals have already been released, and we expect to continue to see those releases going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Cuban government also made it known to us that it is going to be taking steps to increase internet connectivity for its citizens.\xc2\xa0 This would obviously be a welcomed step.\xc2\xa0 And with the additional authorization for U.S. telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba, combined with Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to pursue greater internet connectivity, we believe that the Cuban people will be further empowered.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Cubans are increasing their engagement with the United Nations and with the International Committee of the Red Cross to have discussions about certain conditions within Cuba.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that we have consistently encouraged the Cubans to take action on, and so there will be additional visits to come for those two institutions.</p>\n<p>Finally, I\xe2\x80\x99d note that President Obama spoke yesterday with President Raul Castro of Cuba to review and finalize the steps that were taken today in terms of the release of the three Cubans in exchange for our intelligence asset and for the release of Alan Gross.\xc2\xa0 And the President also made clear his intent to pursue these policy changes, but also to continue our advocacy for human rights in Cuba.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my State Department colleague to give a little bit more detail on the State pieces of this.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Let me just go through a couple of things from the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s perspective that are our responsibility, or our emphasis.</p>\n<p>On diplomatic relations let me just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, diplomatic -- full diplomatic relations are something that get worked out between two governments.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to move towards full diplomatic relations, reestablishment of them.\xc2\xa0 They were broken in 1961, as my colleague mentioned.</p>\n<p>As you probably all know, we did not have any presence in Cuba from 1961 until 1977, when we established the Interests Section.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been under the protection of the Swiss the entire time.\xc2\xa0 But we will end that relationship and move towards having an embassy and the full normal diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 But those things get worked out between the two governments, and they will -- we will proceed to do so in conjunction with the Cubans.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t know exactly what that timeline will be, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll move towards that as quickly as we can.</p>\n<p>The other part of this that is within the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s purview is the review that the President has asked for of the listing of Cuba on the state sponsor of terrorism list.\xc2\xa0 Cuba has been on that list since 1982.\xc2\xa0 And we will undertake that review quickly.\xc2\xa0 But there are many steps that are in the law that we must undertake, and so we will do that, including the consultations with the intelligence community and other steps in the law before we undertake the recommendation that will be made at the end of that process.</p>\n<p>Let me also emphasize that I think what my colleague said -- let me emphasize, as well, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that this is being done because we believe the policy of the past has not worked and because we believe that the best way to bring democracy and prosperity to Cuba is to do so via a different kind of policy.\xc2\xa0 But that does not for a moment believe that we\'re lessening our emphasis on human rights, on democracy, on the importance of civil society.\xc2\xa0 Quite the contrary.\xc2\xa0 In fact, our emphasis on human rights will be just as strong and we believe more effective under this policy.\xc2\xa0 We will engage directly with the Cuban government on human rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as an example of that, our principal officer in Havana, Jeff DeLaurentis, will be meeting with members of Cuban society and dissidents later today to walk them through the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives of today, and to emphasize to them, as well, that their efforts on behalf of democracy and human rights in Cuba not only won\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten in these initiatives, but will, in fact, take center stage and a new emphasis, and we believe a new -- get new wind, if you will, by this approach.</p>\n<p>Let me also say that one of the things you all know is that our policy and the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone about it on Cuba has been a severe problem -- or we\xe2\x80\x99ve been severely criticized for it by most countries, if not all, in this hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 You may remember that in 2012, when the President attended the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, this was one of the issues that was universally criticized by countries around the hemisphere, our policy on Cuba.</p>\n<p>We believe that this policy shift and the way we will engage the Cuban government in support of democracy and prosperity will greatly help our policy initiatives around the hemisphere and our influence throughout the hemisphere on things that are important to us, including democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 And we expect strong support from governments throughout the hemisphere, both for this policy change and for efforts to support and promote civil society and human rights in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So we expect those efforts to be more effective under this policy than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me stop with that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And now we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to our colleague at the Department of Treasury.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you and good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 As my colleague noted, the changes that the President will be announcing today aimed at advancing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy on empowering the Cuban people, promoting political, social and economic reform in Cuba, and will also pave the way for enhanced commerce and trade between the United States and Cuba in certain areas.\xc2\xa0 There is a slew of changes that the Office of Foreign Access Control, or OFAC, will be implementing through amendments to our Cuban assets control regulations to give effect to these changes, and I expect to see those changes made in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To give you a little bit of detail, in 2011 we took steps to ease travel restrictions, in particular with respect to Americans\xe2\x80\x99 ability to visit family in Cuba, generally licensing such travel.\xc2\xa0 We will be easing travel in the coming weeks across all of the 12 categories for which OFAC has historically issued licenses.\xc2\xa0 Those categories are family visits; official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments and international organizations; journalistic activity; professional research and professional meetings; educational activities, religious activities, public performances, workshops, and other competitions and expeditions; support for the Cuban people; humanitarian projects; activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; export-import of the transmission of information or informational materials, as well as certain export transactions that may be considered for authorization under the existing guidelines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Under these new forthcoming regulations, travel to Cuba for tourist activities, which Congress has defined as activities outside of these 12 categories, will remain prohibited.\xc2\xa0 Concerning remittances, we had already eased in 2009 restrictions on non-family remittances to allow individuals in the United States to send up to $500 to any Cuban national, with the exception of Cuba government or communist party officials per quarter.\xc2\xa0 The President will be announcing that we will be increasing that amount to $2,000 per quarter.\xc2\xa0 Notably, donated remittances for humanitarian projects, support for the Cuban people, and development of private businesses in Cuba will be generally licensed with no limitation on amount.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Another very important area in which we will be easing restrictions is increasing communication and access to communication technology for the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 Telecom and Internet linkages between the U.S. and Cuba, including infrastructure related to those linkages in Cuba, will be authorized without requiring a specific license from OFAC.\xc2\xa0 These steps build upon efforts initiated in 2009 to facilitate the increase flow of information to and from the island.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The regulatory definition of cash in advance, a provision that regulates payment for the export of agricultural and medical goods from the U.S. to Cuba, will be changed to a cash before transfer of title definition.\xc2\xa0 This will allow U.S. exporters to be more competitive with respect to their exports to Cuba, and will generally permit the export of agricultural products to Cuba so long as payment is received prior to the goods arrival at a Cuban port of entry.</p>\n<p>U.S. travelers to Cuba will be permitted to import into the United States merchandise as they bring back with them with a value of up to $400 per person.\xc2\xa0 Included in this new provision will be an allowance of up to $100 per person of alcohol or tobacco products.\xc2\xa0 I also want to note that we will be issuing new regulations to allow U.S. banks to establish correspondent accounts with Cuban banks.\xc2\xa0 U.S. financial institutions will also be authorized to facilitate the use of U.S. credit and debit cards by travelers in Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These changes will ease the flow of remittances to, and authorize transactions with, the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 This also means that those who do trade with Cuba -- for example, in the areas of agricultural medicine and medical products, telecommunications, et cetera -- will have a much easier time doing so, and the financial easing will facilitate a number of the changes that I outlined above.</p>\n<p>As I noted earlier, the regulatory amendments are currently in development and you will see these changes in the coming weeks, along with detailed guidance.\xc2\xa0 These changes will not take effect, however, until the new regulations have been published, and we will take every measure possible to keep everyone apprised of developments.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Commerce now.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hi, Secretary Pritzker strongly supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to spur long overdue economic and political reform in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 She believes that commercial diplomacy initiatives outlined today will strengthen human rights and the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 She believes that economics and more commercial engagement have the power to change lives for the better, and she looks forward to the opportunity to visit -- to do a commercial diplomacy visit to Cuba as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to encourage positive change in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the Commerce Department will be issuing regulations that will authorize for export certain building materials for private residential construction, goods for use by private sector Cuban entrepreneurs, and agricultural equipment for small farmers.\xc2\xa0 These changes will make it easier for Cuban citizens to have access to lower-priced goods to improve their living standards, gain greater economic independence from the state, and overall develop the private sector in Cuba.</p>\n<p>In addition, regulations also will be issued to facilitate export of telecom devices equipment, including related hardware, software and services in order to enhance communications to and from Cuba and among the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if, one, you could talk a little bit more about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call with President Castro yesterday, how long it lasted and what else was discussed.\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan for them to talk again in the future?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, on these talks that have taken place since the spring, mostly in Canada, could you elaborate a little bit more on that, how that took place?\xc2\xa0 And was there a key moment -- what happened that made today happen?\xc2\xa0 In other words, was there a meeting last week?\xc2\xa0 What was the final critical stage that pulled all this together?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Peter.\xc2\xa0 On the first question, the call yesterday I think lasted between 45 minutes and an hour, and it was obviously the first engagement at the presidential level with Cuba since the Cuban Revolution.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama went through the swap and the release of Alan Gross, and then discussed the changes that he would be announcing today.\xc2\xa0 They discussed the potential for cooperation on issues like Ebola, issues in the hemisphere, issues like counterterrorism and counter-narcotics.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President did underscore that we would continue our support for democracy and human rights in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Again, President Castro reviewed the steps that Cuba is taking, and I\'ll leave it -- I believe President Castro is making a statement later today, so I won\'t go into too much detail about what he said.\xc2\xa0 We tend not to do that with calls with foreign counterparts.\xc2\xa0 But suffice to say, they were summing up the work that\'s been done through the channel over the course of the last -- over a year now, as well as looking forward to the announcements today, while noting that we understand we\'re going to continue to have differences.\xc2\xa0 So this change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t negate the fact that the U.S. and Cuba are going to have strong differences on the Cuban political model and on aspects of foreign policy, both U.S. and Cuban foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 So they had areas of agreement and areas of difference that they went through on the call.</p>\n<p>With respect to the channel, I could give a couple more details.\xc2\xa0 This was initiated when the President authorized exploratory discussions with Cuban officials in the spring of 2013.\xc2\xa0 We have multiple ways of communicating with Cuba, through our Interests Section in Havana and those here in Washington, and we interacted -- our missions in New York.\xc2\xa0 So we have the ability to pass messages, and so we initiated this contact with the Cuban government last spring.</p>\n<p>The first face-to-face discussions with the Cubans took place in June of 2013 in Canada.\xc2\xa0 And again, Canada was the principal venue for a series of discussions that took place between June of 2013 and November of this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of critical meetings or junctures, I\'d just note a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, it was very important to us that we recover this intelligence asset for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted Alan Gross to be released for five years now.\xc2\xa0 We rejected the notion that Alan Gross was an intelligence asset, so we were not going to engage in a swap of intelligence assets that involved Alan Gross directly.</p>\n<p>Number two, this intelligence asset did heroic work for the United States at great risk to himself, enabling the prosecution of a number of individuals, including the Cuban Five.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years, and so our ability to recover him was an important principle for us in those discussions.\xc2\xa0 But also, this was an opportunity to review broader aspects of our relationship, areas of agreement and disagreement, to get a sense from Cuba of the steps that they are contemplating taking, and the release of a certain number of prisoners was important to us, but also to explore with them areas of practical cooperation and the types of steps that President Obama is announcing today.</p>\n<p>An important meeting, and I guess where you could say this all was finalized, was hosted by the Vatican.\xc2\xa0 So senior Vatican officials received both the U.S. and Cuban delegations this fall, and essentially the Vatican was a venue for the U.S. and Cuban sides to present their commitments and to finalize the types of steps that are being taken, including obviously the prisoner transfers.\xc2\xa0 And the support of Pope Francis and the support of the Vatican was important to us, given the esteem with which both the American and Cuban people hold the Catholic Church and, in particular, Pope Francis, who as you know has a substantial history in Latin America -- the first Pope to be chosen from Latin America.\xc2\xa0 So President Obama has enormous respect for Pope Francis and his personal engagement in this was important to us.</p>\n<p>When President Obama met with Pope Francis, for instance, earlier this year, Cuba was a topic of discussion that got as much attention as anything else that the two of them discussed.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that particularly the exchange and transfer of prisoners was finalized in that meeting at the Vatican, but we also were able to review the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99d each be taking with the Vatican, including the normalization of relations between the countries and the establishment of diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 And the Vatican welcomed that news.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that there were no meetings that took place in either Cuba or the United States in this channel, and I\xe2\x80\x99d also just note that we are not going to characterize the Cuban participation just because that\xe2\x80\x99s our principle in terms of these types of negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we did with respect, for instance, to the work that Jake Sullivan and Bill Burns did with the Iranian side in the lead-up to the Joint Plan of Action last year.</p>\n<p>So with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move to the next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the timeframe or the opening end of this?\xc2\xa0 Does this have to follow the sort of the (inaudible) to what happened with Vietnam?\xc2\xa0 When would you expect to actually have restoration of diplomatic relations?\xc2\xa0 And will the President be trying to overturn Helms-Burton?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Andrea.\xc2\xa0 So the decision has been made to establish diplomatic relations by both President Obama and President Castro.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to establish an embassy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to restore diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, just a matter of going through the process -- logistical and otherwise -- of formalizing that decision.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t put an exact timeline on it, but we expect to do it as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 But for your purposes, I mean, I think you can characterize this as a decision that has been made that will be taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And now, with the announcement today, what that will do is set in motion discussions that can take place between the Department of State and then reps in Cuba to resolve any specifics related to the establishment of a U.S. embassy in Cuba and a Cuban embassy here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too difficult, given the fact that we already have a very significant Interests Section in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So we have a presence there, but we are now going to transition that into an embassy.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t put an exact timeline on it because the discussions are just being initiated today, but the discussions are taking place with both Presidents having taken a decision to establish diplomatic relations.</p>\n<p>The second question was Helms-Burton.\xc2\xa0 Look, we start from the premise that -- the President does -- that the collective policy known as the embargo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked, so we support efforts to remove those restrictions.\xc2\xa0 However, we understand that Congress is unlikely to take those steps in the immediate future.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today is acting within the boundaries of the law to substantially increase travel, investment, commerce with Cuba through what the President can do.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99d encourage members of Congress to look at what they can do to support the direction the President has set today.</p>\n<p>And again, our belief is that -- as with the family travel and remittances -- it will become evident that there are benefits in this type of engagement, and that already there is support in Congress on a bipartisan basis for a new approach.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also strong opposition.\xc2\xa0 So there will be a debate that takes place.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that the utility of these policy changes will become evident and will hopefully create greater momentum for legislative action going forward.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also note that attitudes have been changing.\xc2\xa0 The Cuban American population, particularly younger generations of Cuban Americans have increasingly supported greater openness.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that President Obama personally experienced in his contacts with Cuban Americans and in his travels to places like Florida and New Jersey and in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a continued evolution of public opinion, of opinion in the Cuban American community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if you look at the constituency for this type of change, it involves many different elements of American society:\xc2\xa0 Cuban Americans; the Catholic Church has been very supportive; the U.S. business community has been very supportive of the type of changes that we\'re announcing today.\xc2\xa0 So again, we believe that there is a substantial constituency and multiple constituencies for this type of change.\xc2\xa0 And that too will shape the dynamic in Congress going forward.</p>\n<p>Next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 Just wondered if you could follow up on the Congress question.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President has talked to the new Republican leadership about this and asked them for anything in terms of a timeline on moving forward on lifting the embargo?</p>\n<p>And then, I\xe2\x80\x99m also curious -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting from some of my colleagues on some USAID programs that have been pretty controversial in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Does that factor into these discussions at all?\xc2\xa0 And is Raj Shah\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave the administration part of this negotiation?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So on your first question, Julie, the President has had a number of conversations with members of Congress leading up to this decision.\xc2\xa0 And he and other administration officials have briefed multiple members of Congress, including the leadership and key committee members and key members who focused on Cuban American relations.</p>\n<p>Again, we\'re not focused today on legislative action; we\'re focused on what the President can do.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not sought to initiate any process with respect to the lifting of the embargo.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s signaling with the actions he\xe2\x80\x99s taking today that he does not think that policy has succeeded, and we\xe2\x80\x99d welcome efforts in Congress to end those restrictions.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not focused today on calling on Congress to take a particular action.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on communicating this new direction for U.S. policy.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also note that in terms of the recovery of Alan Gross, we had Senator Flake, Senator Leahy and Congressman Van Hollen travel on the plane to get Alan.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s indicative of bipartisan support in Congress for not just Alan\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, but for the types of changes that we have announced today.\xc2\xa0 Alan will also be greeted at the airport by a group of members of Congress.</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank really a broad group of members of Congress who have advocated for Alan\xe2\x80\x99s release, but also for these types of changes we\'re announcing.</p>\n<p>With respect to USAID, Raj\xe2\x80\x99s departure had absolutely nothing to do with this.\xc2\xa0 He had long planned to leave around the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve known that for some time now.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s merely a coincidence of timing.\xc2\xa0 Raj, by the way, has done extraordinary work as USAID Director and we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly have more time to honor his contributions.</p>\n<p>With respect to the democracy programming, it did factor into the discussions.\xc2\xa0 The Cubans do not like our democracy programming.\xc2\xa0 They consistently protest those initiatives, not just in our channel, but in other diplomatic engagements with the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue our support for civil society for the advancement of our values in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So really, that was an issue of difference that we will continue to have with Cuba, and we fully expect them to raise those issues just as we will raise issues with the Cubans about democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 However, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that through a normal relationship.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that through our embassy in Havana.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that through contacts between our various agencies.</p>\n<p>This does not need to be a relationship that is frozen in time.\xc2\xa0 If there is any U.S. foreign policy that has passed its expiration date, it is the U.S.-Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on today is turning the page to a new chapter where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be more able to raise directly with the Cubans our concerns, and, frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be more able to directly raise with us their concerns.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, that can avert hopefully the type of scenario we had with Alan Gross.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just briefly, could you talk about the timing of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xc2\xa0 And then also, could you give a little bit more color about the upcoming OAS Summit and how much of a -- how awkward the existing U.S. policy would have been, how much pushback there would have been?\xc2\xa0 Would the President not have even been able to attend that summit, or what would that have been like had you not made this change?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Good questions there.\xc2\xa0 The letter followed the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Pope Francis.\xc2\xa0 So they discussed these issues.\xc2\xa0 I think Pope Francis got a sense that President Obama was contemplating these types of changes.\xc2\xa0 We had already initiated discussions with Cuba, but Pope Francis then decided to make a personal appeal, which is very rare.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t received communications like this from the Pope that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of other than this instance.</p>\n<p>And so he sent that letter directly to President Obama, and separately he communicated through a letter directly to President Castro early this summer following the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And that gave I think greater impetus and momentum for us to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And then of course, the Vatican hosted the two delegations, and they were the only government, I should note, that participated in these discussions.\xc2\xa0 Canada hosted talks, but when we met at the Vatican with the Cuban side, Vatican officials were in that meeting, and so they were able to participate and express their support for these steps.</p>\n<p>With respect to the Summit of the Americas, it is a huge burden, if not an albatross, on our relations in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 The last Summit of the Americas, instead of talking about the things that we were focused on -- exports, counter-narcotics, citizen security -- we spent a lot of time talking about U.S.-Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, any of you who cover the hemisphere know that a key factor in every bilateral relationship we have -- including with our closest friends in the hemisphere -- is when are you going to change your Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so we believe that this substantially opens the door for the United States in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 This could be a transformative event for the United States in Latin America, and I think that will be a very positive aspect of this policy.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about Cuba, it\xe2\x80\x99s about Latin America broadly.</p>\n<p>I would also add that, having taken these steps, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be saying to our friends in the hemisphere that we all need to be raising human rights with the Cuban government; that, frankly, there will no longer be this focus on American policy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve changed that.\xc2\xa0 And now we can focus on discussing issues we care about and that includes human rights.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity in that respect, as well.\xc2\xa0 And the summit in Panama will be an opportunity to advance those discussions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, we believe that this is going to be a very important issue in terms of increasing our engagement in Latin America, and it positions the United States to advance our interests and our values more effectively without us being the issue, without our Cuba policy consistently being the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Just one additional in terms of international fora.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the annual vote on whether or not the U.S. embargo should be lifted at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 That took place earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 I believe the vote was something along the lines of 192 to 2.\xc2\xa0 I think we were joined by Palau in that vote.\xc2\xa0 The rest of the world has gone from this set of policies, and I think this will be good for the United States and not just the hemisphere, but in the world and in international fora generally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Next Question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hello, yes, thank you for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if in the past, Congress, and especially led by Cuban American lawmakers, have (inaudible) at this by the Obama administration to ease restrictions on travel and remittances.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you reached out to them and what has been their response in terms of all these new efforts being announced today.\xc2\xa0 And also, can you confirm that, in fact, there was a swap -- because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen media reports that Alan Gross\xe2\x80\x99s freedom was not a swap, so can you clarify that please?\xc2\xa0 And thank you so much for doing this again.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, no I\'m happy to clarify that.\xc2\xa0 There was a swap for the three Cubans in exchange for the U.S. intelligence asset who\xe2\x80\x99s been detained in Cuba for nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 That was a swap.\xc2\xa0 Alan Gross was not a part of that exchange because he\xe2\x80\x99s not an intelligence agent, but the Cuban government took the decision to release Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for their decision to release Alan.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a swap -- three Cubans who were intelligence assets for Cuba and who have been imprisoned here in the United States for over 15 years for the U.S. intelligence asset who\xe2\x80\x99s been imprisoned in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And then Alan Gross was released concurrently this morning as a humanitarian step by the Cuban government.</p>\n<p>With respect to Cuban American members of Congress, look, we respect the passion of those who have been advocates for change in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We recognize that some members of Congress, including some Cuban American members of Congress, will strongly disagree with elements of what the President is announcing today.\xc2\xa0 But this is going to be a continued dialogue, and our point is going to be that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking these steps because we care about the same things.\xc2\xa0 We care about the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 We care about human rights.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the current approach isn\xe2\x80\x99t working and that a policy of engagement is going to be more effective.</p>\n<p>However, as we engage Cuba, as we establish an embassy, as we prepare for the Summit of the Americas, we want the Cuban American community broadly to be partners in setting the agenda and communicating to us what we need to be concerned about.\xc2\xa0 But with respect to the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority, we are acting within the limits that have been set by Congress but we believe and are certain, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done the appropriate reviews inside the government, that the President has the authority to announce the steps that he did today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For instance, diplomatic relations -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an area that falls fully within the purview of the President.\xc2\xa0 The SSOT list, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a determination based on the facts.\xc2\xa0 And then these regulatory changes that will facilitate greater commerce and travel, we are acting within the boundaries that have been set and so we\xe2\x80\x99re confident in our ability to take these steps.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve got time for a couple more questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the trade portion of this plan, how would you characterize how open trade will be with Cuba?\xc2\xa0 Is there any estimate on the potential market for U.S. exporters?\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, what about the Cuban side?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to be able to buy Cuban cigars?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn this to my Treasury and Commerce colleagues to start.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 This will open up certain kinds of products that will be mainly used by the private sector within Cuba, which only recently has initiated and is growing.\xc2\xa0 It will be residential construction, goods used by private sector Cuban entrepreneurs such as restaurants, barber shops, small business operators, and agricultural equipment for small farmers.\xc2\xa0 So it is designed to strengthen civil society and the private sector.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is a focus on telecommunications equipment and facilitating exports of goods and services that will enable the country to improve its telecom and IT infrastructure.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 To give you some round numbers for dollar values, last year, in 2013, we at Commerce issued licenses for almost $300 million worth of commercial sales for medical products alone and about $3 billion of agricultural exports.\xc2\xa0 So just in those two areas that have already been authorized, there are some substantial potential.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And the regulatory changes being announced today will be implemented through new regulations, but they will facilitate the ability to do exports by making the opportunity to do that more general and have more general authority to do that, rather than having to apply for specific licenses each time.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 This is from the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 I would just respond to the final part of the question.\xc2\xa0 Authorized travelers to Cuba we allow to return with $400 worth of general goods and up to $100 of alcohol or tobacco products.\xc2\xa0 That can include cigars.\xc2\xa0 But that authorization is for personal consumption; that is not for resale or commercial purposes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I would just add one more piece to that, which is that existing authorized trade for food and medicine, but particularly for agricultural goods, is going to be facilitated by a number of the measures that are going to be undertaken by the Department of the Treasury, particularly with respect to the cash and advance rule for agricultural sales.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure you fully answered Angela\xe2\x80\x99s question about buying Cuban cigars.\xc2\xa0 Not to take it to that level, but there are some of us who would probably like that answered question -- that question answered.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like from what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the importing of Cuban goods is still going to be restricted by the embargo.\xc2\xa0 And is the travel ban on American travel to Cuba being lifted here, or is that still being constrained by the embargo?\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to know if Fidel Castro was involved.\xc2\xa0 Was Fidel Castro involved in any of these conversations that led up to today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement?\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much for doing the call.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start.\xc2\xa0 And again, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a proud Cuban American.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the travel, we cannot completely lift the travel ban because of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 However, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is we\xe2\x80\x99re authorizing as much travel as we possibly can within the constraints of legislation.\xc2\xa0 So every kind of travel that can possibly be licensed we are now permitting.\xc2\xa0 And so that should lead to a significant ability for Americans to travel to Cuba for the broad variety of purposes that were outlined earlier in the call.</p>\n<p>So the ban has to be lifted by Congress, but the President is doing everything that he can with his authority to facilitate travel within the limitations of the law.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that that will lead to a significant increase in travel.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen Americans take advantage of the more limited licensing that has facilitated travel to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 With these steps, there is a significant broadening to include every kind of travel that is licensable under the law, and that should lead to an increase in Americans traveling.</p>\n<p>Fidel Castro was not involved in the discussions.\xc2\xa0 President Raul Castro obviously was the individual on the Cuban side who was authorizing his team and the person who communicated with President Obama yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Cuban side can speak to their decision-making process.\xc2\xa0 But clearly, Raul Castro is the President of Cuba now and is the decision-maker on these steps.</p>\n<p>And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleagues on your question.\xc2\xa0 But again, you are permitted to purchase tobacco products, including cigars up to a certain amount, so that may be the answer you\'re looking for.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleagues.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so that amount is $100 if you\'re an authorized traveler.\xc2\xa0 So if you\'re going under any of the categories that my colleague and I have outlined, you can purchase up to $100 of tobacco products to bring back to the United States -- but not for resale -- for consumption or for personal use.</p>\n<p>With respect to the travel categories, I do want to just correct a misstatement I made at the very outset in my opening remarks.\xc2\xa0 There have been two prior relaxations by President Obama with respect to travel:\xc2\xa0 2009 generally focused on family travel, and 2011 focused on a number of other categories, including educational, cultural, religious, and journalistic activity.\xc2\xa0 And I had put the 2011 date on family travel.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to be sure I corrected that.</p>\n<p>MS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everyone.\xc2\xa0 With that, our call is concluded.\xc2\xa0 Just to reiterate the ground rules on -- the embargo on this call is now lifted.\xc2\xa0 The embargo on the White House factsheet is also now lifted.\xc2\xa0 But you can only quote the officials on this phone call on background and attributed to senior administration officials, rather than by name.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Have a great day.</p>\n<p>END</p>\n<p>11:02 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>Via Telephone</p>\n<p>10:02 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much for joining this background call on policy changes to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 This call will be embargoed until the end of the call.\xc2\xa0 We will lift the embargo at the end of the call, so you cannot report anything that you hear on this call until the call is concluded.\xc2\xa0 At that point, you may quote officials on the call as senior administration officials only, not by name.\xc2\xa0 We will also lift the embargo on the factsheet that the White House released this morning at the end of this call.</p>\n<p>So again, at the end of the call you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to report on background anything you hear on this call as well as quote from the factsheet, but not before this call is over.</p>\n<p>We have seven senior administration officials with us today from across the interagency.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will turn it over to senior administration official number one.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start by walking you through the overview of what we will be announcing today, and then my colleagues can fill in some of the details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First of all, these steps will be the most significant changes to our Cuba policy in more than 50 years.\xc2\xa0 The President, when he came into office, was committed to changing a policy that we felt had failed to advance our interests for the last several decades by promoting greater openness with Cuba and facilitating greater access for the Cuban people to economic opportunity and to the type of relations with the United States that can ultimately empower the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>In that vein, the President, as you know, authorized, for instance, Cuban Americans to be able to travel to the island and to send remittances to their family on the island.\xc2\xa0 We received very positive feedback from those initial policy changes.\xc2\xa0 And the President was committed to pursuing additional steps through his time in office.</p>\n<p>However, we had a significant impediment to our ability to pursue additional policy changes with the imprisonment -- wrongful imprisonment of Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor in Cuba, for over five years now.</p>\n<p>So, first, let me walk you through Alan\xe2\x80\x99s release and an exchange of intelligence assets that took place today before getting into the policy changes.\xc2\xa0 Importantly, we did pursue a swap, an exchange of intelligence assets, including the return of the three Cubans who remained jailed in the United States from the so-called Cuban Five Wasp Network.\xc2\xa0 They were returned to Cuba this morning.\xc2\xa0 In exchange, the Cubans released a U.S. intelligence asset who has been imprisoned in Cuba for nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 The identity of this asset will remain secret, but we can provide you with some information about his importance to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this individual was responsible for some of the most important intelligence and counterintelligence prosecutions that the United States has been able to pursue in recent decades.\xc2\xa0 For instance, he provided the information that led to the identification and conviction of Defense Intelligence Agency senior analyst, Ana Belen Montes; former Department of State official, Walter Kendall Myers and his spouse, Gwendolyn Myers; and members of the Wasp Network in Florida, including the so-called Cuban Five.\xc2\xa0 So again, this intelligence asset, who was a part of this exchange, provided information that led to the prosecution in part of the Cuban Five.\xc2\xa0 So his return was particularly important to us.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Cuba agreed to release Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 And Alan was flown back -- is currently flying back to the United States with his wife, Judy.\xc2\xa0 Again, we believe Alan was wrongfully imprisoned, and we overwhelmed with joy that Alan will be reunited with his family, particularly in this holiday season of Hanukkah.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, the exchange was the three Cubans who have been imprisoned in the United States for the U.S. intelligence asset who\xe2\x80\x99s been imprisoned in Cuba for nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 And then the Cuban government released Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds.</p>\n<p>With that issue resolved, the President is now going to be announcing very significant changes to our Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0 What we are doing is beginning the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give the overview of these steps, and then my colleagues can fill in some details.</p>\n<p>First, we will be immediately initiating discussions with Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since 1961.\xc2\xa0 And so we will enter into discussions with Cuba about reestablishing an embassy in Havana, and we will be initiating high-level contacts and visits with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We do so in the belief that there are significant issues where we\xe2\x80\x99d benefit from cooperation, like our current efforts to fight Ebola, where Cuba has dispatched hundreds of health care workers to Africa, but also issues like migration, counterterrorism, drug trafficking, disaster response, where practical cooperation can serve the interests of the United States and Cuba.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we fully expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have strong differences, particularly on issues related to democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 The United States will continue to promote our values.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to support civil society in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue our democracy programming.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, the fact that we are reestablishing diplomatic relations is, frankly, a better way in our view of advancing our interests and our values.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has long believed that engagement is a better tool than isolation, and nowhere is that clearer than in Cuba where we have seen a policy of isolation fail for the last 50 years in advancing American interests and values on the island.</p>\n<p>Second, the President has instructed Secretary Kerry to review Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 So that process will be initiated and has to go through a formal review so that we are guided by the facts and the law in making that determination.</p>\n<p>Third, we are taking a number of steps to significantly increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And we do this on the premise that it does not make sense to impose restrictions on the American people and on American businesses that disadvantage the freedom of Americans to travel or the ability of U.S. businesses to operate in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And so those -- the steps that we are taking will facilitate greater activity for U.S. persons and businesses, but also, importantly, we believe that by further opening up to Cuba, we will be able to promote openness and reform in Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There have been some incremental reforms taken in Cuba in recent years, but clearly we believe that more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 Again, however, we believe that openness is a better policy than isolation in advancing the things that we care about in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So there will be greater people-to-people engagement and travel opportunity.\xc2\xa0 There will be the ability for the American people to use credit and debit cards when they travel to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be increasing significantly the amount of money that can be sent to Cuba through remittances.\xc2\xa0 We will, again, be facilitating increased transactions, including U.S. financial institutions being allowed to open accounts in Cuban financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 And we will be authorizing increased telecommunications connections between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 All of these policy changes my colleagues can go through in greater detail.</p>\n<p>In addition, the United States will be participating at the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year, and Cuba will be participating as well.\xc2\xa0 We are not objecting to Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s participation at the summit.\xc2\xa0 We are making clear that we believe that democracy and human rights have to be on the agenda at the summit; that civil society has to be included at the summit.</p>\n<p>But I would note that in all of his engagements with Latin American leaders, the President has consistently heard of the importance of taking the kind of steps that he is taking today, which we believe will be strongly welcomed across the hemisphere.</p>\n<p>Let me just go through a couple other points before turning to my colleagues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of how we got to where we are today, the President authorized a high-level channel of communication with the Cuban government last spring.\xc2\xa0 The individuals on the U.S. side who participated in that channel are Ben Rhodes and Ricardo Zu\xc3\xb1iga, the Senior Director for Western Hemisphere here at the National Security Council.</p>\n<p>There were multiple meetings with Cuban officials that took place in third countries; I\xe2\x80\x99ll just identify the two principal ones.\xc2\xa0 Canada hosted the majority of these meetings, and I want to thank the Canadian government for providing its good offices and hosting our discussions with the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 Canada did not participate in the substance of the discussions, but they were indispensable in providing a venue and support for these efforts.</p>\n<p>Second, and very importantly, the Vatican played a role in this as well.\xc2\xa0 Pope Francis personally issued an appeal through a letter that he sent to President Obama and to President Raul Castro, calling on them to resolve the case of Alan Gross and the cases of the three Cubans who have been imprisoned here in the United States, and also encouraging the United States and Cuba to pursue a closer relationship.\xc2\xa0 The Vatican then hosted the U.S. and Cuban delegations where we were able to review the commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99re making today in terms of the exchange of assets, in terms of the release of Alan Gross, and also in terms of some of the other changes in our relations that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also note that the Cuban government has made some additional decisions.\xc2\xa0 These are sovereign decisions of the Cuban government that we have welcomed.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, the Cuban government agreed to release 53 prisoners whose cases we brought to their attention.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals that we believe are political prisoners, and we welcome very much their release.\xc2\xa0 A number of those individuals have already been released, and we expect to continue to see those releases going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Cuban government also made it known to us that it is going to be taking steps to increase internet connectivity for its citizens.\xc2\xa0 This would obviously be a welcomed step.\xc2\xa0 And with the additional authorization for U.S. telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba, combined with Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to pursue greater internet connectivity, we believe that the Cuban people will be further empowered.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Cubans are increasing their engagement with the United Nations and with the International Committee of the Red Cross to have discussions about certain conditions within Cuba.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that we have consistently encouraged the Cubans to take action on, and so there will be additional visits to come for those two institutions.</p>\n<p>Finally, I\xe2\x80\x99d note that President Obama spoke yesterday with President Raul Castro of Cuba to review and finalize the steps that were taken today in terms of the release of the three Cubans in exchange for our intelligence asset and for the release of Alan Gross.\xc2\xa0 And the President also made clear his intent to pursue these policy changes, but also to continue our advocacy for human rights in Cuba.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my State Department colleague to give a little bit more detail on the State pieces of this.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Let me just go through a couple of things from the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s perspective that are our responsibility, or our emphasis.</p>\n<p>On diplomatic relations let me just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, diplomatic -- full diplomatic relations are something that get worked out between two governments.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to move towards full diplomatic relations, reestablishment of them.\xc2\xa0 They were broken in 1961, as my colleague mentioned.</p>\n<p>As you probably all know, we did not have any presence in Cuba from 1961 until 1977, when we established the Interests Section.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been under the protection of the Swiss the entire time.\xc2\xa0 But we will end that relationship and move towards having an embassy and the full normal diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 But those things get worked out between the two governments, and they will -- we will proceed to do so in conjunction with the Cubans.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t know exactly what that timeline will be, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll move towards that as quickly as we can.</p>\n<p>The other part of this that is within the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s purview is the review that the President has asked for of the listing of Cuba on the state sponsor of terrorism list.\xc2\xa0 Cuba has been on that list since 1982.\xc2\xa0 And we will undertake that review quickly.\xc2\xa0 But there are many steps that are in the law that we must undertake, and so we will do that, including the consultations with the intelligence community and other steps in the law before we undertake the recommendation that will be made at the end of that process.</p>\n<p>Let me also emphasize that I think what my colleague said -- let me emphasize, as well, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that this is being done because we believe the policy of the past has not worked and because we believe that the best way to bring democracy and prosperity to Cuba is to do so via a different kind of policy.\xc2\xa0 But that does not for a moment believe that we\'re lessening our emphasis on human rights, on democracy, on the importance of civil society.\xc2\xa0 Quite the contrary.\xc2\xa0 In fact, our emphasis on human rights will be just as strong and we believe more effective under this policy.\xc2\xa0 We will engage directly with the Cuban government on human rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as an example of that, our principal officer in Havana, Jeff DeLaurentis, will be meeting with members of Cuban society and dissidents later today to walk them through the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives of today, and to emphasize to them, as well, that their efforts on behalf of democracy and human rights in Cuba not only won\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten in these initiatives, but will, in fact, take center stage and a new emphasis, and we believe a new -- get new wind, if you will, by this approach.</p>\n<p>Let me also say that one of the things you all know is that our policy and the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone about it on Cuba has been a severe problem -- or we\xe2\x80\x99ve been severely criticized for it by most countries, if not all, in this hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 You may remember that in 2012, when the President attended the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, this was one of the issues that was universally criticized by countries around the hemisphere, our policy on Cuba.</p>\n<p>We believe that this policy shift and the way we will engage the Cuban government in support of democracy and prosperity will greatly help our policy initiatives around the hemisphere and our influence throughout the hemisphere on things that are important to us, including democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 And we expect strong support from governments throughout the hemisphere, both for this policy change and for efforts to support and promote civil society and human rights in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So we expect those efforts to be more effective under this policy than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me stop with that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And now we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to our colleague at the Department of Treasury.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you and good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 As my colleague noted, the changes that the President will be announcing today aimed at advancing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy on empowering the Cuban people, promoting political, social and economic reform in Cuba, and will also pave the way for enhanced commerce and trade between the United States and Cuba in certain areas.\xc2\xa0 There is a slew of changes that the Office of Foreign Access Control, or OFAC, will be implementing through amendments to our Cuban assets control regulations to give effect to these changes, and I expect to see those changes made in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To give you a little bit of detail, in 2011 we took steps to ease travel restrictions, in particular with respect to Americans\xe2\x80\x99 ability to visit family in Cuba, generally licensing such travel.\xc2\xa0 We will be easing travel in the coming weeks across all of the 12 categories for which OFAC has historically issued licenses.\xc2\xa0 Those categories are family visits; official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments and international organizations; journalistic activity; professional research and professional meetings; educational activities, religious activities, public performances, workshops, and other competitions and expeditions; support for the Cuban people; humanitarian projects; activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; export-import of the transmission of information or informational materials, as well as certain export transactions that may be considered for authorization under the existing guidelines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Under these new forthcoming regulations, travel to Cuba for tourist activities, which Congress has defined as activities outside of these 12 categories, will remain prohibited.\xc2\xa0 Concerning remittances, we had already eased in 2009 restrictions on non-family remittances to allow individuals in the United States to send up to $500 to any Cuban national, with the exception of Cuba government or communist party officials per quarter.\xc2\xa0 The President will be announcing that we will be increasing that amount to $2,000 per quarter.\xc2\xa0 Notably, donated remittances for humanitarian projects, support for the Cuban people, and development of private businesses in Cuba will be generally licensed with no limitation on amount.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Another very important area in which we will be easing restrictions is increasing communication and access to communication technology for the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 Telecom and Internet linkages between the U.S. and Cuba, including infrastructure related to those linkages in Cuba, will be authorized without requiring a specific license from OFAC.\xc2\xa0 These steps build upon efforts initiated in 2009 to facilitate the increase flow of information to and from the island.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The regulatory definition of cash in advance, a provision that regulates payment for the export of agricultural and medical goods from the U.S. to Cuba, will be changed to a cash before transfer of title definition.\xc2\xa0 This will allow U.S. exporters to be more competitive with respect to their exports to Cuba, and will generally permit the export of agricultural products to Cuba so long as payment is received prior to the goods arrival at a Cuban port of entry.</p>\n<p>U.S. travelers to Cuba will be permitted to import into the United States merchandise as they bring back with them with a value of up to $400 per person.\xc2\xa0 Included in this new provision will be an allowance of up to $100 per person of alcohol or tobacco products.\xc2\xa0 I also want to note that we will be issuing new regulations to allow U.S. banks to establish correspondent accounts with Cuban banks.\xc2\xa0 U.S. financial institutions will also be authorized to facilitate the use of U.S. credit and debit cards by travelers in Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These changes will ease the flow of remittances to, and authorize transactions with, the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 This also means that those who do trade with Cuba -- for example, in the areas of agricultural medicine and medical products, telecommunications, et cetera -- will have a much easier time doing so, and the financial easing will facilitate a number of the changes that I outlined above.</p>\n<p>As I noted earlier, the regulatory amendments are currently in development and you will see these changes in the coming weeks, along with detailed guidance.\xc2\xa0 These changes will not take effect, however, until the new regulations have been published, and we will take every measure possible to keep everyone apprised of developments.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Commerce now.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hi, Secretary Pritzker strongly supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to spur long overdue economic and political reform in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 She believes that commercial diplomacy initiatives outlined today will strengthen human rights and the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 She believes that economics and more commercial engagement have the power to change lives for the better, and she looks forward to the opportunity to visit -- to do a commercial diplomacy visit to Cuba as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to encourage positive change in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the Commerce Department will be issuing regulations that will authorize for export certain building materials for private residential construction, goods for use by private sector Cuban entrepreneurs, and agricultural equipment for small farmers.\xc2\xa0 These changes will make it easier for Cuban citizens to have access to lower-priced goods to improve their living standards, gain greater economic independence from the state, and overall develop the private sector in Cuba.</p>\n<p>In addition, regulations also will be issued to facilitate export of telecom devices equipment, including related hardware, software and services in order to enhance communications to and from Cuba and among the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if, one, you could talk a little bit more about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call with President Castro yesterday, how long it lasted and what else was discussed.\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan for them to talk again in the future?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, on these talks that have taken place since the spring, mostly in Canada, could you elaborate a little bit more on that, how that took place?\xc2\xa0 And was there a key moment -- what happened that made today happen?\xc2\xa0 In other words, was there a meeting last week?\xc2\xa0 What was the final critical stage that pulled all this together?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Peter.\xc2\xa0 On the first question, the call yesterday I think lasted between 45 minutes and an hour, and it was obviously the first engagement at the presidential level with Cuba since the Cuban Revolution.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama went through the swap and the release of Alan Gross, and then discussed the changes that he would be announcing today.\xc2\xa0 They discussed the potential for cooperation on issues like Ebola, issues in the hemisphere, issues like counterterrorism and counter-narcotics.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President did underscore that we would continue our support for democracy and human rights in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Again, President Castro reviewed the steps that Cuba is taking, and I\'ll leave it -- I believe President Castro is making a statement later today, so I won\'t go into too much detail about what he said.\xc2\xa0 We tend not to do that with calls with foreign counterparts.\xc2\xa0 But suffice to say, they were summing up the work that\'s been done through the channel over the course of the last -- over a year now, as well as looking forward to the announcements today, while noting that we understand we\'re going to continue to have differences.\xc2\xa0 So this change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t negate the fact that the U.S. and Cuba are going to have strong differences on the Cuban political model and on aspects of foreign policy, both U.S. and Cuban foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 So they had areas of agreement and areas of difference that they went through on the call.</p>\n<p>With respect to the channel, I could give a couple more details.\xc2\xa0 This was initiated when the President authorized exploratory discussions with Cuban officials in the spring of 2013.\xc2\xa0 We have multiple ways of communicating with Cuba, through our Interests Section in Havana and those here in Washington, and we interacted -- our missions in New York.\xc2\xa0 So we have the ability to pass messages, and so we initiated this contact with the Cuban government last spring.</p>\n<p>The first face-to-face discussions with the Cubans took place in June of 2013 in Canada.\xc2\xa0 And again, Canada was the principal venue for a series of discussions that took place between June of 2013 and November of this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of critical meetings or junctures, I\'d just note a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, it was very important to us that we recover this intelligence asset for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted Alan Gross to be released for five years now.\xc2\xa0 We rejected the notion that Alan Gross was an intelligence asset, so we were not going to engage in a swap of intelligence assets that involved Alan Gross directly.</p>\n<p>Number two, this intelligence asset did heroic work for the United States at great risk to himself, enabling the prosecution of a number of individuals, including the Cuban Five.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years, and so our ability to recover him was an important principle for us in those discussions.\xc2\xa0 But also, this was an opportunity to review broader aspects of our relationship, areas of agreement and disagreement, to get a sense from Cuba of the steps that they are contemplating taking, and the release of a certain number of prisoners was important to us, but also to explore with them areas of practical cooperation and the types of steps that President Obama is announcing today.</p>\n<p>An important meeting, and I guess where you could say this all was finalized, was hosted by the Vatican.\xc2\xa0 So senior Vatican officials received both the U.S. and Cuban delegations this fall, and essentially the Vatican was a venue for the U.S. and Cuban sides to present their commitments and to finalize the types of steps that are being taken, including obviously the prisoner transfers.\xc2\xa0 And the support of Pope Francis and the support of the Vatican was important to us, given the esteem with which both the American and Cuban people hold the Catholic Church and, in particular, Pope Francis, who as you know has a substantial history in Latin America -- the first Pope to be chosen from Latin America.\xc2\xa0 So President Obama has enormous respect for Pope Francis and his personal engagement in this was important to us.</p>\n<p>When President Obama met with Pope Francis, for instance, earlier this year, Cuba was a topic of discussion that got as much attention as anything else that the two of them discussed.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that particularly the exchange and transfer of prisoners was finalized in that meeting at the Vatican, but we also were able to review the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99d each be taking with the Vatican, including the normalization of relations between the countries and the establishment of diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 And the Vatican welcomed that news.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that there were no meetings that took place in either Cuba or the United States in this channel, and I\xe2\x80\x99d also just note that we are not going to characterize the Cuban participation just because that\xe2\x80\x99s our principle in terms of these types of negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we did with respect, for instance, to the work that Jake Sullivan and Bill Burns did with the Iranian side in the lead-up to the Joint Plan of Action last year.</p>\n<p>So with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move to the next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the timeframe or the opening end of this?\xc2\xa0 Does this have to follow the sort of the (inaudible) to what happened with Vietnam?\xc2\xa0 When would you expect to actually have restoration of diplomatic relations?\xc2\xa0 And will the President be trying to overturn Helms-Burton?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Andrea.\xc2\xa0 So the decision has been made to establish diplomatic relations by both President Obama and President Castro.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to establish an embassy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to restore diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, just a matter of going through the process -- logistical and otherwise -- of formalizing that decision.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t put an exact timeline on it, but we expect to do it as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 But for your purposes, I mean, I think you can characterize this as a decision that has been made that will be taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And now, with the announcement today, what that will do is set in motion discussions that can take place between the Department of State and then reps in Cuba to resolve any specifics related to the establishment of a U.S. embassy in Cuba and a Cuban embassy here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too difficult, given the fact that we already have a very significant Interests Section in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So we have a presence there, but we are now going to transition that into an embassy.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t put an exact timeline on it because the discussions are just being initiated today, but the discussions are taking place with both Presidents having taken a decision to establish diplomatic relations.</p>\n<p>The second question was Helms-Burton.\xc2\xa0 Look, we start from the premise that -- the President does -- that the collective policy known as the embargo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked, so we support efforts to remove those restrictions.\xc2\xa0 However, we understand that Congress is unlikely to take those steps in the immediate future.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today is acting within the boundaries of the law to substantially increase travel, investment, commerce with Cuba through what the President can do.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99d encourage members of Congress to look at what they can do to support the direction the President has set today.</p>\n<p>And again, our belief is that -- as with the family travel and remittances -- it will become evident that there are benefits in this type of engagement, and that already there is support in Congress on a bipartisan basis for a new approach.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also strong opposition.\xc2\xa0 So there will be a debate that takes place.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that the utility of these policy changes will become evident and will hopefully create greater momentum for legislative action going forward.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also note that attitudes have been changing.\xc2\xa0 The Cuban American population, particularly younger generations of Cuban Americans have increasingly supported greater openness.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that President Obama personally experienced in his contacts with Cuban Americans and in his travels to places like Florida and New Jersey and in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a continued evolution of public opinion, of opinion in the Cuban American community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if you look at the constituency for this type of change, it involves many different elements of American society:\xc2\xa0 Cuban Americans; the Catholic Church has been very supportive; the U.S. business community has been very supportive of the type of changes that we\'re announcing today.\xc2\xa0 So again, we believe that there is a substantial constituency and multiple constituencies for this type of change.\xc2\xa0 And that too will shape the dynamic in Congress going forward.</p>\n<p>Next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 Just wondered if you could follow up on the Congress question.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President has talked to the new Republican leadership about this and asked them for anything in terms of a timeline on moving forward on lifting the embargo?</p>\n<p>And then, I\xe2\x80\x99m also curious -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting from some of my colleagues on some USAID programs that have been pretty controversial in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Does that factor into these discussions at all?\xc2\xa0 And is Raj Shah\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave the administration part of this negotiation?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So on your first question, Julie, the President has had a number of conversations with members of Congress leading up to this decision.\xc2\xa0 And he and other administration officials have briefed multiple members of Congress, including the leadership and key committee members and key members who focused on Cuban American relations.</p>\n<p>Again, we\'re not focused today on legislative action; we\'re focused on what the President can do.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not sought to initiate any process with respect to the lifting of the embargo.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s signaling with the actions he\xe2\x80\x99s taking today that he does not think that policy has succeeded, and we\xe2\x80\x99d welcome efforts in Congress to end those restrictions.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not focused today on calling on Congress to take a particular action.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on communicating this new direction for U.S. policy.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also note that in terms of the recovery of Alan Gross, we had Senator Flake, Senator Leahy and Congressman Van Hollen travel on the plane to get Alan.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s indicative of bipartisan support in Congress for not just Alan\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, but for the types of changes that we have announced today.\xc2\xa0 Alan will also be greeted at the airport by a group of members of Congress.</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank really a broad group of members of Congress who have advocated for Alan\xe2\x80\x99s release, but also for these types of changes we\'re announcing.</p>\n<p>With respect to USAID, Raj\xe2\x80\x99s departure had absolutely nothing to do with this.\xc2\xa0 He had long planned to leave around the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve known that for some time now.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s merely a coincidence of timing.\xc2\xa0 Raj, by the way, has done extraordinary work as USAID Director and we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly have more time to honor his contributions.</p>\n<p>With respect to the democracy programming, it did factor into the discussions.\xc2\xa0 The Cubans do not like our democracy programming.\xc2\xa0 They consistently protest those initiatives, not just in our channel, but in other diplomatic engagements with the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue our support for civil society for the advancement of our values in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So really, that was an issue of difference that we will continue to have with Cuba, and we fully expect them to raise those issues just as we will raise issues with the Cubans about democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 However, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that through a normal relationship.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that through our embassy in Havana.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that through contacts between our various agencies.</p>\n<p>This does not need to be a relationship that is frozen in time.\xc2\xa0 If there is any U.S. foreign policy that has passed its expiration date, it is the U.S.-Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on today is turning the page to a new chapter where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be more able to raise directly with the Cubans our concerns, and, frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be more able to directly raise with us their concerns.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, that can avert hopefully the type of scenario we had with Alan Gross.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just briefly, could you talk about the timing of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xc2\xa0 And then also, could you give a little bit more color about the upcoming OAS Summit and how much of a -- how awkward the existing U.S. policy would have been, how much pushback there would have been?\xc2\xa0 Would the President not have even been able to attend that summit, or what would that have been like had you not made this change?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Good questions there.\xc2\xa0 The letter followed the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Pope Francis.\xc2\xa0 So they discussed these issues.\xc2\xa0 I think Pope Francis got a sense that President Obama was contemplating these types of changes.\xc2\xa0 We had already initiated discussions with Cuba, but Pope Francis then decided to make a personal appeal, which is very rare.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t received communications like this from the Pope that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of other than this instance.</p>\n<p>And so he sent that letter directly to President Obama, and separately he communicated through a letter directly to President Castro early this summer following the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And that gave I think greater impetus and momentum for us to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And then of course, the Vatican hosted the two delegations, and they were the only government, I should note, that participated in these discussions.\xc2\xa0 Canada hosted talks, but when we met at the Vatican with the Cuban side, Vatican officials were in that meeting, and so they were able to participate and express their support for these steps.</p>\n<p>With respect to the Summit of the Americas, it is a huge burden, if not an albatross, on our relations in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 The last Summit of the Americas, instead of talking about the things that we were focused on -- exports, counter-narcotics, citizen security -- we spent a lot of time talking about U.S.-Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, any of you who cover the hemisphere know that a key factor in every bilateral relationship we have -- including with our closest friends in the hemisphere -- is when are you going to change your Cuba policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so we believe that this substantially opens the door for the United States in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 This could be a transformative event for the United States in Latin America, and I think that will be a very positive aspect of this policy.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about Cuba, it\xe2\x80\x99s about Latin America broadly.</p>\n<p>I would also add that, having taken these steps, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be saying to our friends in the hemisphere that we all need to be raising human rights with the Cuban government; that, frankly, there will no longer be this focus on American policy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve changed that.\xc2\xa0 And now we can focus on discussing issues we care about and that includes human rights.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity in that respect, as well.\xc2\xa0 And the summit in Panama will be an opportunity to advance those discussions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, we believe that this is going to be a very important issue in terms of increasing our engagement in Latin America, and it positions the United States to advance our interests and our values more effectively without us being the issue, without our Cuba policy consistently being the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Just one additional in terms of international fora.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the annual vote on whether or not the U.S. embargo should be lifted at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 That took place earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 I believe the vote was something along the lines of 192 to 2.\xc2\xa0 I think we were joined by Palau in that vote.\xc2\xa0 The rest of the world has gone from this set of policies, and I think this will be good for the United States and not just the hemisphere, but in the world and in international fora generally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Next Question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hello, yes, thank you for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if in the past, Congress, and especially led by Cuban American lawmakers, have (inaudible) at this by the Obama administration to ease restrictions on travel and remittances.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you reached out to them and what has been their response in terms of all these new efforts being announced today.\xc2\xa0 And also, can you confirm that, in fact, there was a swap -- because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen media reports that Alan Gross\xe2\x80\x99s freedom was not a swap, so can you clarify that please?\xc2\xa0 And thank you so much for doing this again.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, no I\'m happy to clarify that.\xc2\xa0 There was a swap for the three Cubans in exchange for the U.S. intelligence asset who\xe2\x80\x99s been detained in Cuba for nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 That was a swap.\xc2\xa0 Alan Gross was not a part of that exchange because he\xe2\x80\x99s not an intelligence agent, but the Cuban government took the decision to release Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for their decision to release Alan.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a swap -- three Cubans who were intelligence assets for Cuba and who have been imprisoned here in the United States for over 15 years for the U.S. intelligence asset who\xe2\x80\x99s been imprisoned in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And then Alan Gross was released concurrently this morning as a humanitarian step by the Cuban government.</p>\n<p>With respect to Cuban American members of Congress, look, we respect the passion of those who have been advocates for change in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We recognize that some members of Congress, including some Cuban American members of Congress, will strongly disagree with elements of what the President is announcing today.\xc2\xa0 But this is going to be a continued dialogue, and our point is going to be that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking these steps because we care about the same things.\xc2\xa0 We care about the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 We care about human rights.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the current approach isn\xe2\x80\x99t working and that a policy of engagement is going to be more effective.</p>\n<p>However, as we engage Cuba, as we establish an embassy, as we prepare for the Summit of the Americas, we want the Cuban American community broadly to be partners in setting the agenda and communicating to us what we need to be concerned about.\xc2\xa0 But with respect to the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority, we are acting within the limits that have been set by Congress but we believe and are certain, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done the appropriate reviews inside the government, that the President has the authority to announce the steps that he did today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For instance, diplomatic relations -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an area that falls fully within the purview of the President.\xc2\xa0 The SSOT list, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a determination based on the facts.\xc2\xa0 And then these regulatory changes that will facilitate greater commerce and travel, we are acting within the boundaries that have been set and so we\xe2\x80\x99re confident in our ability to take these steps.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve got time for a couple more questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the trade portion of this plan, how would you characterize how open trade will be with Cuba?\xc2\xa0 Is there any estimate on the potential market for U.S. exporters?\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, what about the Cuban side?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to be able to buy Cuban cigars?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn this to my Treasury and Commerce colleagues to start.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 This will open up certain kinds of products that will be mainly used by the private sector within Cuba, which only recently has initiated and is growing.\xc2\xa0 It will be residential construction, goods used by private sector Cuban entrepreneurs such as restaurants, barber shops, small business operators, and agricultural equipment for small farmers.\xc2\xa0 So it is designed to strengthen civil society and the private sector.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is a focus on telecommunications equipment and facilitating exports of goods and services that will enable the country to improve its telecom and IT infrastructure.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 To give you some round numbers for dollar values, last year, in 2013, we at Commerce issued licenses for almost $300 million worth of commercial sales for medical products alone and about $3 billion of agricultural exports.\xc2\xa0 So just in those two areas that have already been authorized, there are some substantial potential.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And the regulatory changes being announced today will be implemented through new regulations, but they will facilitate the ability to do exports by making the opportunity to do that more general and have more general authority to do that, rather than having to apply for specific licenses each time.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 This is from the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 I would just respond to the final part of the question.\xc2\xa0 Authorized travelers to Cuba we allow to return with $400 worth of general goods and up to $100 of alcohol or tobacco products.\xc2\xa0 That can include cigars.\xc2\xa0 But that authorization is for personal consumption; that is not for resale or commercial purposes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I would just add one more piece to that, which is that existing authorized trade for food and medicine, but particularly for agricultural goods, is going to be facilitated by a number of the measures that are going to be undertaken by the Department of the Treasury, particularly with respect to the cash and advance rule for agricultural sales.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure you fully answered Angela\xe2\x80\x99s question about buying Cuban cigars.\xc2\xa0 Not to take it to that level, but there are some of us who would probably like that answered question -- that question answered.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like from what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the importing of Cuban goods is still going to be restricted by the embargo.\xc2\xa0 And is the travel ban on American travel to Cuba being lifted here, or is that still being constrained by the embargo?\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to know if Fidel Castro was involved.\xc2\xa0 Was Fidel Castro involved in any of these conversations that led up to today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement?\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much for doing the call.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start.\xc2\xa0 And again, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a proud Cuban American.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the travel, we cannot completely lift the travel ban because of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 However, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is we\xe2\x80\x99re authorizing as much travel as we possibly can within the constraints of legislation.\xc2\xa0 So every kind of travel that can possibly be licensed we are now permitting.\xc2\xa0 And so that should lead to a significant ability for Americans to travel to Cuba for the broad variety of purposes that were outlined earlier in the call.</p>\n<p>So the ban has to be lifted by Congress, but the President is doing everything that he can with his authority to facilitate travel within the limitations of the law.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that that will lead to a significant increase in travel.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen Americans take advantage of the more limited licensing that has facilitated travel to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 With these steps, there is a significant broadening to include every kind of travel that is licensable under the law, and that should lead to an increase in Americans traveling.</p>\n<p>Fidel Castro was not involved in the discussions.\xc2\xa0 President Raul Castro obviously was the individual on the Cuban side who was authorizing his team and the person who communicated with President Obama yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Cuban side can speak to their decision-making process.\xc2\xa0 But clearly, Raul Castro is the President of Cuba now and is the decision-maker on these steps.</p>\n<p>And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleagues on your question.\xc2\xa0 But again, you are permitted to purchase tobacco products, including cigars up to a certain amount, so that may be the answer you\'re looking for.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleagues.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so that amount is $100 if you\'re an authorized traveler.\xc2\xa0 So if you\'re going under any of the categories that my colleague and I have outlined, you can purchase up to $100 of tobacco products to bring back to the United States -- but not for resale -- for consumption or for personal use.</p>\n<p>With respect to the travel categories, I do want to just correct a misstatement I made at the very outset in my opening remarks.\xc2\xa0 There have been two prior relaxations by President Obama with respect to travel:\xc2\xa0 2009 generally focused on family travel, and 2011 focused on a number of other categories, including educational, cultural, religious, and journalistic activity.\xc2\xa0 And I had put the 2011 date on family travel.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to be sure I corrected that.</p>\n<p>MS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everyone.\xc2\xa0 With that, our call is concluded.\xc2\xa0 Just to reiterate the ground rules on -- the embargo on this call is now lifted.\xc2\xa0 The embargo on the White House factsheet is also now lifted.\xc2\xa0 But you can only quote the officials on this phone call on background and attributed to senior administration officials, rather than by name.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Have a great day.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:02 A.M.
