Brady Press Briefing Room \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:26 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0Before we get to your questions, let me do a quick announcement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama, on November 9, 2015, will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. \xc2\xa0The President looks forward to discussing with the Prime Minister regional security issues, including implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to peacefully and verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and countering Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in the region. \xc2\xa0The President also looks forward to discussing Israel\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the Palestinians, the situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the need for the genuine advancement of a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPrime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the United States is a deep demonstration of the deep and enduring bonds between the United States and Israel, as well as our unprecedented cooperation to further enhance Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s November 9th.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can we follow on that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure, Connie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does that coincide with Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s release from prison?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You have to check with the Department of Justice for an update on his status. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, want to get us started?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Please. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Syria and General Austin\xe2\x80\x99s pretty surprising admission that there are only four to five U.S.-trained Syrians in the fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0Why is Senator Sessions not right in calling this program, the training program, \xe2\x80\x9ca total failure\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mark, we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged for some time the significant challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered in training and equipping and sending to the battlefield moderate elements of the Syrian opposition. \xc2\xa0And the administration knew on the front end that this would be a quite difficult task, and it\xe2\x80\x99s proven to be even more difficult than we thought.</p>\n<p>\n\tGeneral Austin acknowledged the challenges that they were facing and acknowledged that the program would require some changes. \xc2\xa0Clearly those changes are warranted. \xc2\xa0For what sort of changes they believe will be most effective, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense that\'s implementing this specific plan. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut more broadly, the anti-ISIL coalition has been able to effectively coordinate with other local fighters on the ground. \xc2\xa0This includes Syrian Kurds, Syrian Arabs, Turkmen and other fighters inside of Syria that have succeeded in driving ISIL out of some important strategically held territory in Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole lot more work to do. \xc2\xa0But much of that progress would not have been possible without the strong support of the anti-ISIL coalition, particularly in the form of airstrikes that have enhanced the performance of these local fighters on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, Josh, you guys placed a fair amount of emphasis on this part of the strategy at the outset. \xc2\xa0Was that mistaken to put so much trust in the U.S. training Syrians? \xc2\xa0And is it -- I know you talk about changes that have to be made. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to just to scrap that part of the strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, for how the program should be addressed to correct some of these problems, I\xe2\x80\x99d direct you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0They can sort of talk to you about the operational details of the specific programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would point out that many of the most ardent critics of this administration, particularly when it comes to our Syria policy, have suggested that a much more significant and deeper investment in this training effort is what the administration should have pursued years ago. \xc2\xa0So it is true that we have found this to be a difficult challenge. \xc2\xa0But it is also true that many of our critics had proposed this specific option as essentially the cure-all for all of the policy challenges that we\'re facing in Syria right now. \xc2\xa0That is not something that this administration ever believed, but it is something that our critics will have to answer for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me stick with Syria, and Secretary of State Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of having spoken to the Russians and the suggestion that there should -- the Russian proposal for military-to-military talks. \xc2\xa0Is the administration going to go ahead with that? \xc2\xa0Do you think that\'s a worthwhile avenue to pursue?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point right now I don\'t have a specific announcement to make about any additional consultations with the Russians. \xc2\xa0What we have said for some time is that we would welcome constructive Russian support for the efforts of the anti-ISIL coalition in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\'t have anything new to announce.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Russia\xe2\x80\x99s U.N. ambassador said that they\'re ready to start airstrikes, and he doesn\'t see why America would object to that. \xc2\xa0Would we object to Russian airstrikes against ISIL targets?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the short answer is it depends. The fact is we want to make sure that -- a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is any efforts by Russia that are motivated -- that are geared toward doubling down on their support for the Assad regime would be counterproductive and destabilizing. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that is simply that the support for the Assad regime only has the effect of propping up a leader that has utterly lost the legitimacy to lead that country, and it only further divides the population and, in some ways, makes it more likely that we\'re driving some citizens in Syria directly into the arms of ISIL or other extremist groups that oppose the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we would welcome is an integrated, coordinated, constructive effort on the part of the Russians to support the 60-member coalition of nations that is working to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more briefly, if I may, about the Business Roundtable remarks the President had and his rather pointed remarks about all the doom and gloom talk he\xe2\x80\x99s hearing from Republican candidates and how they should maybe talking America down and America is winning now. \xc2\xa0First of all, are you really sure he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to watch the debate tonight? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And second, are you sure that maybe a certain one of those candidates isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting under his skin a little bit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t watch the debate tonight. \xc2\xa0He will be interested to hear what happens, but I don\'t think that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching it in real-time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the comments that you heard from the President apply to a significant number of candidates in the Republican field. \xc2\xa0And this is part of politics, this is part of a political debate, and you\'ve heard me say before that there is a lot of value in having a robust political debate in this country as we make decisions as a collection of citizens about which direction we believe that our country should move. \xc2\xa0The President, however, believes that that debate should be rooted in facts and an accurate assessment of the kind of tremendous advantages that our country has. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President would be the first to point out that those advantages are hard-won and those are advantages that can be frittered away if the next leader of the country doesn\'t appreciate the way that they contribute to the success of this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So America is winning now -- that\'s not a shot at Donald Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it is an effort to make -- offer the American people a clear, accurate assessment of precisely the advantages that our country enjoys, and to make sure that we\'re mindful of those advantages so that we don\'t end up in a situation where through a series of bad decisions we fritter away that advantage that\'s so critical the success of our country and our citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Also at that Business Roundtable, the President was asked about Chinese cyber-hacking, and he said that the U.S. is preparing a number of measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ll indicate to China, this is something that will put significant strains on the U.S.-China relationship, and that the U.S. is prepared to take countervailing actions. \xc2\xa0Can you shed some light on this? \xc2\xa0What actions did he mean? \xc2\xa0Particularly, is he speaking about sanctions, or more? \xc2\xa0And do you also have a sense of timing of when we might see measures addressing this issue be rolled out, especially as it relates to the visit from President Xi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Julia, I think in this instance the President was intentionally nonspecific in making reference to countervailing actions. \xc2\xa0However, it is consistent with what we discussed in this room yesterday about how the United States has a series of tools that can now be used to counter the activities of those that are using cyberspace to try to gain an economic advantage or carry out acts of vandalism. \xc2\xa0And these are tools that are available to U.S. policymakers because of a policy decision that was made by the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have found that even having those kinds of economic sanctions available to the President and to the Secretary of the Treasury do have a deterrent effect on those who may be contemplating nefarious actions. \xc2\xa0We saw that that was true in confronting Iran, that one of the levers of influence the international community was able to exert on Iran was the prospect of additional and tougher economic sanctions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the point here is, is that there are a range of responses that are available. \xc2\xa0I think as the President said in the Roundtable discussion, hopefully it will not be necessary to use them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And also, following up on something you said yesterday about the House bill to lift the ban on crude oil exports -- you said the White House does not support that bill because you think it is a decision that the Commerce Department should make. \xc2\xa0But does that mean that the President would veto that bill should it make it to his desk?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have a veto threat to issue at this point, but clearly it\'s not a piece of legislation we support because this is essentially the domain of the Commerce Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To follow on Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, does the President believe he\xe2\x80\x99s made America great again?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess to put it another way, Jim, you might say that the President is quite proud of this country and he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly proud of the tremendous progress that the citizens of this country -- in part because of the policies put in place by this administration -- have had in coming back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. \xc2\xa0We\'ve got so much to show for all of our progress. \xc2\xa0But the President is mindful of the fact that the next President will enter into office at a point where those tremendous gains are reversible and that if there is not someone with a clear economic vision for the country that is rooted in fighting for the best interests of the middle class and advancing policies that will expand economic opportunity for middle-class families, that those gains could be reversed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd given all of the hard time and hard work that the President has personally invested in those gains, given all of the hard work that the American people -- American workers and entrepreneurs -- have invested in those gains, the stakes in this election are high. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the President believes that it\'s a worthy part of the political debate for us to discuss what kind of progress we\'ve made so far, what advantages does the country and our citizens enjoy, and how can we capitalize on those advantages to ensure the long-term success of our country. \xc2\xa0And again, these are weighty decisions and they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly worthy of extensive debate and they will be worthy of consideration by the American people as they vote in the next election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last night, the Vice President, when speaking about Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s positions on immigration -- or his comments on immigration -- he called it \xe2\x80\x9ca sick message.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And I know, when he was in Iowa, described some of this rhetoric as being \xe2\x80\x9cun-American.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It does sound as though -- you know, you\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of shied away from talking about Donald Trump here in the Briefing Room -- that the President and the Vice President are starting to comment on this GOP field more. \xc2\xa0And would it be unreasonable to suspect that the Vice President might do some of this following the debate as sort of a rebuttal to what we\'re going to hear tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have a preview of any future vice presidential remarks to share with you. \xc2\xa0You can check with his office about that. \xc2\xa0I think the President, when he was speaking in Iowa, went out of his way to make clear that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about just one candidate in the field. \xc2\xa0We\'ve seen what I\'ve described as an alarming number of Republican candidates demagoguing on this issue, in particular seeking to single out and target immigrants to this country. \xc2\xa0As the President said, it\'s not at all consistent with the kinds of values that have made our country great -- to borrow a phrase.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And getting back to Russia and Syria, I recall that during the time when the coalition airstrikes were beginning this administration warned Assad that he should resist any temptation to interfere in any way whatsoever with aircraft. \xc2\xa0Is the same warning being issued to Russia in the same regard -- to stay out of the way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that you have heard me raise concerns about the possibility that if uncoordinated, that there could be some potential for interference in the activities of some Russian military personnel and the efforts of our anti-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0And we obviously want to make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on China -- this is my last thing -- you just said to Julia that the President was intentionally non-specific. \xc2\xa0What does that mean? \xc2\xa0Why not be specific? \xc2\xa0Is it that you want to let President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit pass and then reassess things after? \xc2\xa0Why non-specific?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think because what is clear, based on the readout that you received from our office over the weekend that U.S. and Chinese officials are engaged in candid, blunt discussions about our concerns in this policy area. \xc2\xa0And I would expect that those kinds of candid discussions will continue even when President Xi visits the White House at the end of next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are some ongoing discussions that are taking place at a high level --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President intend that to be a warning today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think that he merely was stating a fact, which is that the United States does have a range of tools to respond, and we are hopeful that it will not be necessary to use them. \xc2\xa0The reason that I don\'t believe a warning is necessary is, at this point, it is quite clear to the leaders of the Chinese government how serious the Obama administration takes this issue. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, there are a variety of ways to assess our seriousness here. \xc2\xa0The first is that in each of their previous meetings, President Obama has raised this directly with President Xi. \xc2\xa0The Department of Justice has taken aggressive action to try to bring to justice by indicting five Chinese military officials for their actions in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0And in our public comments on this issue over the last several months, you have heard the United States government make clear that we have significant concerns with Chinese behavior, and it is clear that the Chinese government is being responsive to those concerns by at least engaging in a candid discussion of those issues -- a discussion that will continue at the end of next week when President Obama hosts his counterpart here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was two weeks ago today, Josh, that the President called Chancellor Merkel to thank her and to show his support in her coping and dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe, especially in Germany. \xc2\xa0In that two weeks, there is consideration and actually some real disillusionment within the EU itself since open borders are basically a basic premise of what the EU is all about. \xc2\xa0Has the President had another conversation with her or other leaders to show support, to show personal concern that what is going on in Europe, the largest immigration movement or refugee movement since World War II, is something that\'s on his mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0JC, I don\'t have any new calls to tell you about, but the President does continue to be concerned about this significant humanitarian crisis. \xc2\xa0There are millions of human beings who have fled their homes, have fled their communities, many times with their children in tow, seeking refuge. \xc2\xa0And it\'s tragic. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the United States has stepped up to be the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to try to meet the needs of these individuals who are in a desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you have heard me previously compliment the response of Germany, in particular -- both the government and its citizens -- for being so generous in trying to meet the needs of these individuals who are in such a desperate situation. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no one country that\'s going to solve this problem on their own. \xc2\xa0And we\'ll need to see the kind of cooperation that is the hallmark of the European Union to take this -- to confront this challenge head on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President be meeting with individuals from the EU next week when he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York City to discuss this topic?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any meetings at this point to share with you in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for New York, but we should have more details on that next week, I would assume.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, how did President Obama come to post a tweet about a high school student in Texas who made a clock with some wires that got him in trouble? \xc2\xa0And why did he choose to tweet about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President, like many of us, was struck by the news reports of this particular incident. \xc2\xa0Mark, the fact is that America\xe2\x80\x99s best teachers in our schools -- in our best schools at least -- nurture the intellectual curiosity of all of our students. \xc2\xa0In this instance, it\'s clear that at least some of Ahmed\xe2\x80\x99s teachers failed him. \xc2\xa0That\'s too bad. \xc2\xa0But it\'s not too late for all of us to use this as a teachable moment and to search our own conscience for biases in whatever form they take.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis episode is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even good-hearted people who dedicate their lives to educating young people for doing the good work that they set out to do. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President was pleased to extend an invitation -- or the White House was pleased to extend an invitation to Ahmed to participate in Astronomy Night that will be hosted here at the White House next month. \xc2\xa0Astronomy Night is an event that we\'ve previously held here that will bring together government, scientists, and NASA astronauts and others to spend some time with young people examining the wonders of the heavens. \xc2\xa0And it will be an opportunity for them to talk about science and our solar system and the universe. \xc2\xa0And it should be a good event. \xc2\xa0And I think that -- or at least we are hopeful that Ahmed will feel right at home here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does President Obama believe bias was a factor because the young man is Muslim?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think from this distance, it\'s far too early to draw that direct assessment from here. \xc2\xa0We have seen that local law enforcement officials have closed the case. \xc2\xa0And I think there are some difficult and penetrating questions that do need to be asked in pursuit of the information that you just presented.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you so much. \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on the migrants crisis which is happening in Europe -- the Hungarian border at this moment, the situation is extremely tense, with thousands of families trying to cross the border. \xc2\xa0A wall was built in the past three days. \xc2\xa0Does the President approve the wall to prevent migrants to come to Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Laura, we\'ve obviously been following this crisis closely here at the White House. \xc2\xa0The principle that we have championed is one that is rooted in a common human decency. \xc2\xa0These are human beings who are in a desperate, even tragic, situation. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve been forced to flee their homes and their communities because of terrible violence that is taking place there. \xc2\xa0And we have seen a response from many European citizens and European governments indicating the generosity of spirt that\'s required to try to meet some of these basic humanitarian needs of individuals that are in a terribly desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is true is that it\'s not just one country that\'s going to be able to solve all of these challenges. \xc2\xa0And the United States is committed to doing our part to continue to play a leading role in the international response. \xc2\xa0And that means continuing to be the largest donor of bilateral -- the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance. \xc2\xa0And the announcement that we made here last week about our intent to step up our process for taking in Syrian refugees -- a minimum of 10,000 in the next fiscal year -- so that\'s an indication that the United States is stepping up. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see other countries both in Europe and around the world step up to do their part to respond to this particular crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, on a human level, there\xe2\x80\x99s a wall to prevent families trying to come to Europe. \xc2\xa0So what is the White House reaction to this wall? \xc2\xa0It\'s all over the news in Europe at this moment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, what we\'re going to need to see is the recognition by governments and citizens and countries across Europe that Germany is not going to be in the position to solve this problem alone and other countries that have shown a generosity of spirit and accepted a significant number of migrants will not be able to do this alone, that we\'re going to need to see a coordinated effort on the part of countries around the world, including a large number of countries in Europe, to do more to respond to this particular crisis -- and to respond to the basic humanitarian needs of these fellow human beings who are in a desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has led by example in this regard. \xc2\xa0We\'ve seen a tremendous commitment from Germany, to cite just one example. \xc2\xa0And it\'s important for other countries to step up as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just another question on the same subject. \xc2\xa0The former Uruguayan President, two weeks ago, asked Presidents from all over the world to take some migrants to their home. \xc2\xa0Will the President consider to take some migrants in Camp David, for instance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware that that\'s a policy that\'s being considered at this point. \xc2\xa0But there is a well-established process here in the United States for resettling refugees. \xc2\xa0This is something that we talked about a little bit last week, but it bears repeating that for the specific category of refugees as defined by the United Nations, the United States takes in well over half of those refugees that are identified by the United Nations to resettle them. \xc2\xa0To put it another way, the United States takes in and resettles more refugees as described by the United Nations than every other country in the world combined.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is clear that the United States is willing to do our part. \xc2\xa0And we have ramped up those efforts in response to this latest crisis. \xc2\xa0But the United States can\'t do this alone. \xc2\xa0Germany can\'t do this alone. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to need to see other countries in Europe step up to the plate to respond to this particular crisis. \xc2\xa0We\'re also going to need to see countries in the region and other countries around the world that have not traditionally participated in these efforts step up and offer their support even if it\'s financial support.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0Lesley.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Raul Castro is scheduled to go address the U.N. next week. \xc2\xa0I wanted to see if -- I know you said the schedule is in flux still -- if the President is planning on meeting with him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for the United Nations and I don\'t anticipate that we\'ll have that this week. \xc2\xa0But as we have more details of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule next week, we\'ll let you know if that\'s something that\'s on the agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I asked you last week about Cuba releasing prisoners in advance of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0Do you know if the White House has expressed any concern to Cuba that none of the prisoners that they released were in the category of political prisoners?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of the details of any communications between the United States and Cuba on this particular issue, but let me see if I can have somebody follow up with you and give you a better since of where that stands.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on a third issue, can I ask you about -- the President said at the BRT today that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to call Governor Brown. \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to speak about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously the state of California has, in just the last couple of weeks, sustained significant damage and even some loss of property as a result of widespread wildfires in the state of California. \xc2\xa0I know that officials in California, including Governor Brown, have been in touch with FEMA. \xc2\xa0This is the federal agency that\'s responsible for supporting the response and recovery efforts that are already underway and being led by state and local officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will be calling Governor Brown later on this afternoon to get an update on the situation, to determine if there is additional support that the federal government can offer to California as they endure this difficult situation. \xc2\xa0And I\'m confident the President will also convey his support to those Californians that, in some cases, have had to flee their homes or have had over the course of the summer to sustain the significant loss of property. \xc2\xa0He\'ll let them know that the prayers of the First Family and the nation are with them in these difficult times.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Hungarian police are using pepper spray and water cannons on these refugees. \xc2\xa0Are you prepared to condemn those actions?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I\'m prepared to do is to continue to urge countries, government and citizens all across Europe to set up their response to reflect the increased need in this situation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people flee their homes. \xc2\xa0And in a desperate attempt to find refuge somewhere, some of them are even fleeing to Europe. \xc2\xa0And clearly this is a difficult situation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a large number of people, and in some cases we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about countries that are relatively small and don\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of infrastructure and resources to at least smoothly take it all in.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful of is that the government leaders and citizens in all of these countries will keep in mind the basic humanity of these individuals. \xc2\xa0Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people who have in some cases fled their homes with none of their possessions except for the clothes on their back. \xc2\xa0In some cases, they have their children in tow. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re just looking for some safety and some relief. \xc2\xa0And this is when I think the conscience of the world is stirred, and hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll see governments and citizens respond accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the refugees in Hungary say that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay in Hungary, they just want to get through Hungary. \xc2\xa0So should the officials take down the wall and allow safe passage into Germany, into other European countries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific policy prescription to add, but rather I have merely a value that we here in the United States have prioritized. \xc2\xa0And we are hopeful that by focusing on the humanity of those who are in a desperate situation, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see governments and leaders and citizens make the right decisions here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think Hungary is showing them basic humanity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what we certainly believe is that around the world we believe that there is more that can be done to offer up support to these refugees that are in a desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrancesca.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I also wanted to ask about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday. \xc2\xa0Does the President also believe that Donald Trump has a \xe2\x80\x9csick\xe2\x80\x9d message about illegal immigrants?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President spoke at some length about the kind of rhetoric that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Republican candidates for President on the issue of immigration. \xc2\xa0And I think the President was quite stark in suggesting that it was un-American to single out and target those individuals just because of either their race or ethnicity or immigration status.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And along the same lines, the Vice President also said last night, \xe2\x80\x9cFolks, the American people are with us. \xc2\xa0I know it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way, but I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you the American people agree with us.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And he was talking about immigration in that context, too. \xc2\xa0Do you believe that? \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that? \xc2\xa0Because it seems right now that the American people, or at least Republicans, are with Donald Trump on that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s true. \xc2\xa0I think that most of the public polling that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on this issues indicates strong bipartisan support for the kind of bipartisan legislation that had strong bipartisan support in the Senate and would have passed the House if it were not blocked by House Republican leaders who had apparently a different goal in mind. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we continue to take a lot of solace in knowing that the business community, the law enforcement community, even the faith community all have indicated their strong support for common-sense immigration reform that includes not just increased investments in border security, which are critically important and strongly supported by the President and were blocked because of the opposition of Republicans in Congress, but also things like a path to citizenship for those who are here in the country and are basically American in every way except for their papers.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to give you another run at the Syria training story. \xc2\xa0You said it\xe2\x80\x99s proven to be more difficult that we thought. \xc2\xa0Can you expand on that? \xc2\xa0It just seems like an awful lot of money and a lot of investment for very, very little production. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess, Kevin, for a lot of details as it relates to the program, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for implementing and carrying out this mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And have they reported back to you and the President saying this is what happened? \xc2\xa0I just want to get your understanding of what they\xe2\x80\x99re telling you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0The President has been, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, been regularly updated on the challenges that they have encountered in trying to train and equip a moderate Syrian opposition. \xc2\xa0The challenges that are associated with this effort, though, are not difficult to imagine. \xc2\xa0The security situation in Syria is obviously extremely chaotic. \xc2\xa0It means it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to recruit individuals. \xc2\xa0Even if you do recruit them, that chaotic security situation means that you need to intensely vet them. \xc2\xa0We, after all, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of training and equipping individuals that may not share our goals. \xc2\xa0So that is a time-consuming effort as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially asking these individuals to take up the fight against a brutal terrorist organization that is renowned, or at least has received worldwide condemnation for their inhumane tactics and violence. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a tough assignment. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s not an excuse, but it is a fact. \xc2\xa0And that is why the Department of Defense, and I think to General Austin\xe2\x80\x99s credit, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to sit in that chair and to recite these facts, but he did that. \xc2\xa0And I think it reflects certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire and the desire of every member on his national security team to understand the facts and to make decisions rooted in an accurate assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s exactly happening. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s important that certainly the Department of Defense, but everybody else who\xe2\x80\x99s involved in this policymaking process, face up to this significant difficulty that this training-and-equip program has encountered to make the necessary changes and to make sure that the difficulty of this work is factored into our overall strategy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that this certainly was and is one component of our strategy, but so are the military airstrikes that have been used, to important effect, to support the efforts of other fighters on the ground inside of Syria that have succeeded in driving ISIL off some important territory inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0We have seen other strikes and other military missions carried out by the United States that have resulted in the capture and killing of senior ISIL officials, including the second in command in ISIL who was taken out by a U.S. airstrike a month or so ago, to say nothing of our efforts to try to counter radicalism through social media, to try to stop the flow of foreign fighters, to shut down the efforts of ISIL to fund their terrorist activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a comprehensive strategy, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked and acknowledged -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about and acknowledged the difficulty that one component of that strategy has encountered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the budget and funding of Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0What would the President think of funding other medical facilities that might provide similar service, but not Planned Parenthood as an alternative? \xc2\xa0Would that be something that the President would be willing to sign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been I think quite forthright about the President\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to any effort to wholesale defund Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0And I think what has injected this issue into the political dialogue of late are the graphic videos that emerged on the Internet in the last couple of months. \xc2\xa0And Planned Parenthood has apologized for the content of those videos, and they should -- they were shocking. \xc2\xa0But it would -- it is certainly not appropriate for Republicans in Congress -- in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s even cynical for some Republicans in Congress to try to use those videos as an excuse to take away basic health care for millions of families across the country that rely on it every day. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the poverty rate; it\xe2\x80\x99s still around 14.8 percent, 46-plus million people still at or below the poverty rate. \xc2\xa0Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President been able to move the needle on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen a lot of obstruction from members of Congress, Republicans in Congress, to efforts to try to address this particular issue. \xc2\xa0That said, I think there was some good news that was included in the report that, when it comes to child poverty, we actually have seen the largest two-year reduction in child poverty in nearly two decades. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there is some progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot more that we can do to try to address the poverty rate. \xc2\xa0And the first thing that comes to mind is raising the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0One of the things that we have talked about in here is the fact that given the current level of the minimum wage, if you are the head of a household and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to raise -- you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to provide for a spouse and two children based on working full-time at the minimum wage, then you\xe2\x80\x99re raising that family below the poverty line. \xc2\xa0So if we\xe2\x80\x99re actually interested in trying to do something about poverty, let\xe2\x80\x99s raise wages for those hardworking Americans that are just trying to do the right thing by working an honest job and providing for their families. \xc2\xa0That certainly would be one place to start, and it would have a material impact on the numbers that you just cited.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Let me ask you really quickly, to follow up on Ahmed Mohamed. \xc2\xa0So many interesting stories in the news that we often ask you about, and the President doesn\'t comment on them or if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him. \xc2\xa0Why did he decide to get involved with this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that he, like many of us who saw this online or saw it in the newspaper today, I think were struck by this story. \xc2\xa0And look, there are millions of teachers all across our country that dedicate themselves on a daily basis. \xc2\xa0Many of them are underpaid too. \xc2\xa0But they dedicate themselves on a daily basis to trying to nurture the intellectual curiosity of their students. \xc2\xa0And that\'s heroic work, and it\xe2\x80\x99s work that is going to be critical to the long-term success of our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at least in this instance, at least some of Ahmed\xe2\x80\x99s teachers failed him. \xc2\xa0And that\'s a shame. \xc2\xa0And I think it tugs at your heart strings a little bit, and that we at the White House, and the President himself recognized that there could be an opportunity to try to reach out to this young man and give him a unique opportunity to nurture that intellectual curiosity. \xc2\xa0And I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to fit in quite well with the other young people who will be at the White House on Astronomy Night, learning from some of the most informed, cutting-edge scientists in the world about the wonder of the stars and the planets. \xc2\xa0And that will be a tremendous opportunity for him, and we hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to attend. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching on the Twitter feed and I saw everybody from a NASA engineer to a member of Congress just since you\'ve been talking who have tweeted about this. \xc2\xa0Was it specifically that he wanted to spark a larger conversation about this? \xc2\xa0He saw it as an opportunity to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you heard me say that I do think that for all of us that this has the potential to be a teachable moment to search our own conscience for biases that might be there. \xc2\xa0And the reason that we should do that is because I think this is an instance where you have people who have otherwise dedicated their lives to trying to teach our children, who failed in that effort because -- potentially because of some things in their conscience and because of the power of stereotypes.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly more that needs to be learned about in this particular situation. \xc2\xa0But even the potential of that I think is a good reminder to all of us. \xc2\xa0But I think at the end of the day, the President\xe2\x80\x99s tweet and the invitation from the White House are rooted in a desire to try to reach out to a 14-year-old boy, who, at least based on what we know from law enforcement, was wrongly handcuffed in his own school yesterday simply for bringing in a clock. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if I can follow up on Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s questions and others about the U.S.-trained anti-ISIS forces. \xc2\xa0Understanding what you\'ve said about some of the successes that have been had against ISIS and the blunt responses yesterday by the general, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering given the cost involved -- there\xe2\x80\x99s two parts to this, obviously. \xc2\xa0One part of it is the security issue; the other part is a cost-benefit analysis that you have to do in government all the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And given that the Pentagon initially spent about $36 million on this and the initial class was about $600,000 per trainee, and that\'s based on a much larger class than the number of fighters that\'s actually there, is the President angry? \xc2\xa0Is he disappointed? \xc2\xa0Does he see this as a failure?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that this administration has long understood that training and equipping members of the Syrian opposition would be a difficult undertaking. \xc2\xa0And it clearly has turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated. \xc2\xa0And I think those who might observe --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But when you talk about initial plans of 5,400 per year and you\'re looking at just four or five, that\'s more than just something to be anticipated or turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated, don\'t you think?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it certainly raises legitimate questions about what kinds of changes that need to be made to this program. \xc2\xa0And that\'s exactly what General Austin suggested today that he would do. \xc2\xa0That certainly seems appropriate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, over the last year, many of you have understandably asked me questions about the claims of our critics who suggest that the administration should invest more deeply in training and equipping members of the Syrian opposition, that that was the recipe for success.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd General Austin went before Congress today and acknowledged that this was a more difficult endeavor than we assumed, and that we need to make some changes to that program. \xc2\xa0But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also time for our critics to fess up in this regard as well. \xc2\xa0They were wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it didn\'t happen -- you didn\'t go into this or make this investment because the critics pushed you into it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I think General Austin, to his credit -- and I think this is indicative of the kind of character that he has shown throughout his military career -- he sat before that committee, he testified under oath, and he faced the music about a program that has not performed nearly as well as we would have liked. \xc2\xa0We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that kind of character on display from our critics who have suggested for years that this was the recipe for success in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting, therefore, that means the idea was wrong; maybe the idea was done too late or was done ineffectively. \xc2\xa0Why would that be an indictment of the idea? \xc2\xa0Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s an indictment of the execution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, perhaps that\'s the case. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think -- at least I only saw a little bit of the hearing. \xc2\xa0I didn\'t hear a lot of constructive advice to General Austin about how that program could have been more effectively implemented. \xc2\xa0We just heard a lot of complaints from people who are disappointed in the performance despite the fact that they basically said it was the recipe for our success there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, but what if it had been done four years ago? \xc2\xa0Would that have made a difference?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anybody offer up a good explanation about why that would make a difference. \xc2\xa0We would still --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because people said that the opposition hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been as radicalized four years ago, and that by waiting so long you all allowed the opposition to metastasize in a way that meant a lot of people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass your vetting standards now that might have passed four years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t know -- I think it would call into question the vetting standards if somebody could do something in the space of four years that might prevent them from being included in that group.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t think that there is a particularly strong case to be made that an earlier and more significant investment in a program that has shown not very good results -- to put it mildly -- is a recipe for success. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anybody make that argument. \xc2\xa0Maybe there is somebody that does believe that if we have done this differently, we would have gotten a different outcome. \xc2\xa0But that is not what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from our critics. \xc2\xa0But I would welcome them making that case if they believe it.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Monday, in Des Moines, the President when he was talking about the sequester, he used the term \xe2\x80\x9cartificial cap\xe2\x80\x9d to describe that. \xc2\xa0What did he mean by \xe2\x80\x9cartificial\xe2\x80\x9d exactly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President was referring to sequester, this policy jargon that refers to across-the-board budget cuts without regard to the effectiveness or the importance of a particular program. \xc2\xa0And that\'s -- essentially the President described them as artificial because there are programs that we know are working well and enjoy strong bipartisan support, but yet they\'re being cut. \xc2\xa0And that is why the President has continued to urge Republicans to address this problem in the same way that they did two years.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe way that this problem was addressed two years ago was after a two-and-a-half-week government shutdown that was engineered by Republicans. \xc2\xa0Democrats and Republicans got together and hammered out a bipartisan budget agreement that found a bipartisan path to raising those artificial caps where bipartisan agreement could be found. \xc2\xa0That is an effective way for the budget of the greatest country in the world to be managed -- preferably before the government is shut down and not after.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\'s why you have seen Democrats for months now urge Republicans to come and negotiate some bipartisan common ground with Republicans. \xc2\xa0But we have not seen Republicans accept that offer. \xc2\xa0Instead, what we have seen Republicans do is to go and try and pass budgets on a series of party line votes. \xc2\xa0But those votes have failed to produce legislation that reached the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk. \xc2\xa0So that is not a path to funding the government. \xc2\xa0The only path to funding the government is Republicans being willing to work with Democrats, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then today at the Business Roundtable he touted deficit reduction as a mark of economic progress. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sequester at least partly responsible for a great deal of this deficit reduction? \xc2\xa0And looking ahead off the next five, six, seven years, don\'t you see projections that will help with the deficit reduction due to the sequester?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\'t bring my green eyeshade with me, but we can find somebody with a green eyeshade to talk to you about how much the sequester actually accounts for deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the point is that the President believes that we can make critically important investments in our economy -- things like job training and infrastructure and research and development -- things that we know will be good for our economy. \xc2\xa0And we can do that in a fiscally responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President talked about this one example of closing the carried interest loophole. \xc2\xa0This is a proposal that the President advocated even as a candidate for President and drew the scorn of Republicans in Washington and around the country. \xc2\xa0Now we actually find ourselves in a situation where two of the leading Republican candidates for President actually back that proposal. \xc2\xa0So for years Republicans have resisted implementing that plan, closing that loophole that only benefits the most wealthy. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s close that loophole and make some of the investments that we know will be good for our economy. \xc2\xa0That\'s an example of how we can continue on the path of deficit reduction, while also investing in the kinds of economic priorities that will be good for our economy, good for the middle class, and, oh, by the way, will be even better for our deficit. \xc2\xa0So that\'s the kind of common-sense approach the President has taken to budgeting. \xc2\xa0All too often, it has run into this stiff, ideological partisan resistance of Republicans in Congress, but Republicans have not been well served by sort of manning the partisan barricades when it comes to these budget disputes. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for the last several months here; hopefully, they\xe2\x80\x99ll change their strategy as we get close to the deadline here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just finally on the Iran nuke deal. \xc2\xa0Tomorrow, the deadline, the end of the 60-day clock runs out. \xc2\xa0Is the President looking to mark that in any way? \xc2\xa0Is he going to make any sort of a statement or anything on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there is a -- that would be the end of the 60-day clock for congressional consideration of the agreement. \xc2\xa0It, however, is still in the middle of the 90-day window for the U.N., after having voted -- the U.N. Security Council, after having voted on and ratified the agreement before the implementation phase would begin.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that implementation phase would begin not with sanctions relief, I would remind you, but with Iran beginning to take the significant, serious steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to take to curtail their nuclear program -- so everything from disconnecting the centrifuges to gutting the core of their reactor at Arak, and of course reducing their uranium stockpile by 98 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, broadly speaking, is the President still confident in his decision to have authorized the train-and-equip program for Syrian rebels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, when you\xe2\x80\x99re encountering a situation like this, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to play some Monday morning quarterbacking. \xc2\xa0The President was clearly -- believed that it could be an opportunity for the United States to expand the number of local fighters on the ground in Syria with whom we could coordinate. \xc2\xa0I mentioned earlier that there already are fighters on the ground inside Syria -- some Syrian Arabs, Syrian Kurds and others -- who have proved to be effective partners with the United States and our coalition partners in taking the fight to ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believed it was worth trying to augment that number through this train-and-equip program. \xc2\xa0Thus far, that\xe2\x80\x99s not been the result. \xc2\xa0But General Austin and others at CENTCOM are working to implement changes to this program, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if they can implement sufficient changes to get a better result and, as Chris alluded to, get a better bang for the buck for American taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Were there certain changes that the President specifically asked for? \xc2\xa0I mean, is he that in the weeds on this? \xc2\xa0Or is that all deferred to DOD?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about some very basic operational details. \xc2\xa0And I think typically the way that this works is those in the military who are lower in the chain of command make recommendations to the Commander-in-Chief, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Specifically on this issue, did it come up when the Saudi King was here? \xc2\xa0Did the President say he does want to move forward with that part of the train-and-equip program? \xc2\xa0Because I believe the Pentagon says that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even started yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know they talked about a range of issues related to our anti-ISIL campaign when King Salman was here at the White House. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more detailed readout of the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 meeting to share with you at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you, on Israel, I believe you said previously that phone calls had been made, offers had been made broadly by the United States to Israel about stepping up security partnerships and relationships. \xc2\xa0Now that we have the date on the calendar, Bibi is coming to the White House, does that mean you\xe2\x80\x99re going to drill down to some of those specifics? \xc2\xa0Can we expect that that conversation is going to be about increased U.S. military support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that that will certainly be part of their discussion. \xc2\xa0Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously described the level of security cooperation that\xe2\x80\x99s been offered by the Obama administration as \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0That, I think, is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal commitment to the security of Israel and to the unshakeable bond between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has for some time indicated not just a willingness but a desire to engage in conversations about how we can further deepen that security cooperation. \xc2\xa0There was some reticence on the part of the Israelis initially to engage in those discussions. \xc2\xa0But we would expect in the context of this meeting in November and others that may be on the agenda for lower-level officials to begin having those discussions. \xc2\xa0And we certainly would welcome the opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Given the failure of the train-and-equip program in Syria, the migrant crisis in Europe, Russia stepping up in Syria in a more muscular way, the fact that Assad is still in power, how --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering a stump speech in a Republican primary state. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just asking the tough questions. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I appreciate that about you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How is the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to Syria not a failure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Byron, there are a couple of things that we can do to illustrate the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made. \xc2\xa0The fact is there is important progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made on the ground to counter ISIL both in Iraq and in Syria; you asked about Syria, but ISIL has lost more than 17,000 square kilometers of territory in northern Syria, is now cut off from all but 68 miles of the nearly 600-mile-long border between Syria and Turkey. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the senior ISIL official inside of Syria that was killed. \xc2\xa0And there was material in his possession that was exploited for its intelligence value based on a U.S. military operation that the President had ordered. \xc2\xa0We have seen other countries both in the region and around the world demonstrate their willingness to step up and offer greater support to our efforts in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recent announcements from Turkey and from the UK and France to their engagement in Syria. \xc2\xa0That is to say nothing of the kind of engagement and support for our ongoing efforts inside of Syria that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from countries like Jordan and the UAE, who were involved -- and some others -- who were involved on the very first day of this operation. \xc2\xa0And there was a lot of skepticism in this room, understandable skepticism in this room, about whether or not the President would be able to succeed in enlisting those Muslim countries in the Middle East in this effort. \xc2\xa0But we did succeed in doing that. \xc2\xa0And that was a diplomatic accomplishment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also an accomplishment that has consequences for the long-term success of this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress. \xc2\xa0But I would not try to talk you out of the notion that there remains a lot of really important work to be done here. \xc2\xa0And the President -- someone made reference to it earlier -- the President is always pushing his team to get a better assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground and to determine whether or not those facts call for a further refinement or reform to our strategy there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of 2016 stump speeches, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a lot about --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good segue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- the President and his thoughts on Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, but not so much Bernie Sanders. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think only once or twice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Only once or twice. \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders on the trail has talked about tackling big infrastructure projects, he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about expanding the social safety net, and he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about making tuition free at public colleges. \xc2\xa0Those all sound like some things the President himself has talked about. \xc2\xa0What does the President think about Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 agenda and policy proposals?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Senator Sanders obviously has a record not just as a candidate but also as a public servant of somebody who is committed to fighting for the middle class and putting in place policies that he knows will benefit the middle class. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President spent a lot of time at his town hall meeting in Iowa talking about the importance of expanding access to a college education for more students in the United States. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Senator Sanders supports that value, supports that priority. \xc2\xa0They may have some different ideas for how exactly to get there, but those priorities they hold in common.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously Senator Sanders has made a spirited case for his candidacy, and has drawn some large and raucous crowds of enthusiastic Democratic supporters. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say that that kind of energy and enthusiasm on the Democratic side will ultimately be important to the success of the Democratic nominee, regardless of who that person is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President think there needs to be more debates? \xc2\xa0I know Senator Sanders and Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley have called on -- talked about 2016 politics today, so I figured I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President express an opinion about the appropriate number of debates among the Democrat candidates. \xc2\xa0Clearly, there should be debates, and clearly there should be an opportunity for Democratic voters across the country to have an opportunity to evaluate the performance of those candidates in the debates. \xc2\xa0But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President weigh in with a specific number.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharlie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, has the President seen a picture of this clock that was made in Texas that caused so much problems?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President has seen a picture. \xc2\xa0I saw one shortly before I came out here. \xc2\xa0I know that it was starting to be tweeted shortly before I walked out here. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President\xe2\x80\x99s seen it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it possible he\xe2\x80\x99d concede that the Secret Service would make a similar mistake if they saw this device, this homemade clock, near the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess the point, Charlie, is that this was a device that was brought to a school and shown to a science teacher, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at this point speculate about what anybody\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical reaction to it would be. \xc2\xa0What is clear is that the local police department took a look at it and promptly closed the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think that the blame should be placed -- you mentioned the teachers. \xc2\xa0Should blame be placed on the teachers or the police officers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There will be ample opportunity for people to assign blame here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And do you think this calls into question sort of the zero-tolerance policies in public schools for any device that appears threatening?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific policies that may not have guided the response here, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to comment on that without knowing what those policies are.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0On Syria, Secretary Kerry said today that Russia has asked for military-to-military talks with the U.S. \xc2\xa0And given the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re now on the ground with their military there, and President Obama says that he does not want U.S. troops on the ground, and our training effort has seemed to fall very short of the goal, why not open up those military-to-military talks with Russia, and specifically with Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make. \xc2\xa0I will say that obviously the destabilizing strategy that Russia pursued inside of Ukraine had an impact on the military-to-military relationship between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, we have been quite clear about welcoming Russia\xe2\x80\x99s constructive support for the anti-ISIL coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s operating in Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear both publicly and privately. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about the current status of our military-to-military relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I could ask really quickly about the budget. \xc2\xa0The President said earlier today that Republicans have -- or a faction of Republicans have gone off the rails. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a follow-up to what he said earlier last month about Republican crazies who are blocking him on everything and having conspiracy theories. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if he thinks that kind of argument is going to help as we get so close to a deadline where, as he mentioned, billions of dollars were lost in the last government shutdown. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t look like we\xe2\x80\x99re anywhere close to solving this one. \xc2\xa0So does he think that rhetoric is actually going to move us closer to solving that goal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, appeals to their rationality have not moved them in the right direction, at least when it comes to the interests of the country. \xc2\xa0What I will say is that there is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to sit down together and build a bipartisan coalition in support of a budget agreement that is in the best interest of the country and adequately funds our national security and economic priorities. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I guess the good news is if Republicans are willing to work faithfully with Democrats, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to build a sufficiently large bipartisan coalition that even if there are a couple of Republicans that continue to spurn rationality, the legislation will still pass. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is hopeful that Republican leaders will do; that they will follow the model that was established two years ago, which is Democrats and Republicans in Congress sit down together, hammer out a bipartisan agreement -- one that clearly reflects the bipartisan consensus about the best interests of our national security and our economy. \xc2\xa0It will yield a piece of legislation that no one believes is perfect but that a strong majority of Congress can support and the President can sign. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that we believe Congress should take and we believe they should do that before the deadline on September 30th.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President on more than a few occasions has compared himself to Ronald Reagan, citing some policies that he and President Reagan would have agreed on. \xc2\xa0He had one over the summer with the Iran nuclear deal very recently. \xc2\xa0When Republicans meet in California tonight -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some of them will be asked to compare to President Ronald Reagan, given the setting -- what kind of things would the President hope that Ronald Reagan and the President could agree that these candidates could talk about? \xc2\xa0Is there some common ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there certainly is -- I read -- there was an interesting Washington Post story I guess about this a couple of days ago where they talked about how many of the policies that are aggressively opposed by Republicans now are the kinds of policies where President Reagan and President Obama both supported. \xc2\xa0And so whether that\xe2\x80\x99s expanding Medicaid or the notion of trying to resolve diplomatically disagreements that you may have with other countries that wish ill upon the citizens of this country, we saw President Reagan who, despite the rhetoric emanating from the Soviet Union at the time, did have the courage to begin the kinds of negotiations to reduce the nuclear threat to this country that continue to serve as important foundations of our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are just two examples. \xc2\xa0Maybe the moderators tonight will come up with a couple more. \xc2\xa0But I think it does serve to illustrate that there should be an opportunity for us to find common ground, even on some of the priorities that the President has identified. \xc2\xa0The fact that they are supported by a Democratic President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make them automatically partisan. \xc2\xa0It does mean that we would welcome support from Republicans when the President is advocating policies that many Republicans have traditionally supported. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not been the spirit or the attitude of many Republicans in Congress. \xc2\xa0It certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the spirit by those Republicans in Congress that are now running for President. \xc2\xa0But I guess that dichotomy may make for an interesting debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody. \xc2\xa0Have a good day.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:32 P.M.
