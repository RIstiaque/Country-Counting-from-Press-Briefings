EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- if I can, let me just start with a few thoughts.\xc2\xa0 I want to reiterate our administration and our country\xe2\x80\x99s strong condemnation of the violence and the images that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past many hours.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe government of Egypt has to ensure that peaceful protests can take place.\xc2\xa0 We have obviously seen the remarks of the Prime Minister today and hope that his acknowledgment that anybody that is involved in this will be held accountable is something that the government is serious about.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to say a word for a second on the systematic targeting of journalists in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 This also is completely and totally unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 Any journalist that has been detained should be released immediately.\xc2\xa0 I think we need to be clear that the world is watching the actions that are taking place right now in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate again that the actions of targeting journalists, that is unacceptable, and that those journalists should be, if they are detained, released immediately.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has been briefed on this as part of the daily briefing this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, I would like to again reiterate that the -- as we have said all along -- that the time for the transition in Egypt is now, and it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps toward that transition and that negotiations take place between the government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through, as I said, the transition toward free and fair elections.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, let me take a few of your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I heard that Ambassador Wisner perhaps has already met with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if that\xe2\x80\x99s happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I will double-check that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that off the top --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know -- who should we say is representing the United States right now with Wisner back in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret Scobey is our ambassador in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Margaret obviously was fully aware of and spent time with former Ambassador Wisner.\xc2\xa0 Margaret is -- has spoken directly with the President in the past few days.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had a deputies committee meeting this morning in the Situation Room at 8:30 a.m.\xc2\xa0 Those meetings have, for the past many days, started with Margaret providing an update of the situation on the ground, of embassy personnel and of American citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo she\xe2\x80\x99s in contact with all levels of Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the President call the President of Yemen to discuss what happened in Yemen and Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get a readout of the call.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with President Saleh yesterday afternoon in Washington.\xc2\xa0 From Washington, excuse me.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you talk a little bit about the conversations, the latest conversations that the government has had with Israel and what -- and sort of the impact on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have, Michael, a readout beyond the readouts from the weekend and the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know that there have been -- have there been conversations since then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not with the President, but certainly in staff -- staff at the NSC continue to -- folks like Dan Shapiro and Dennis Ross are in touch with their counterparts in the Israeli government and we\xe2\x80\x99re in touch with governments throughout the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration want Mubarak to step down now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my answer on that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the private conversations that the President has had with President Mubarak.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe time for transition, as the President said, is now.\xc2\xa0 And it is important that the world see some concrete steps toward meaningful change.\xc2\xa0 As I enumerated a minute ago, that change should begin with broad-based negotiations between the government and opposition leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else that would be a concrete step that you would look at and think of as a good sign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously the ability to protest peacefully.\xc2\xa0 We continue to call for restraint and nonviolence.\xc2\xa0 I think an immediate step is, as we talk about the individual rights and freedoms that those in Egypt must have, one of those freedoms has to be the rights of journalists to be able to move around and report on the goings-on in the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been any consideration of the need for an outside force in Egypt to separate the two factions, like a U.N. involvement to prevent any escalation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any discussion on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s role?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some chatter in Washington that he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of acting as a proxy for the administration, or do his comments reflect the views of the administration after his talk with the President yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 I think Senator McCain was -- I think they had a very good conversation on a whole host of issues, foreign and domestic.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you should see -- necessarily see his comments as comments that are -- I think they\xe2\x80\x99re reflective of his position.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:18 A.M.
