Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:57 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 Let me just begin with a comment similar to something you heard me say yesterday, which is I know there continues to be intense coverage and interest in details of the ongoing investigation into the incident -- the terrible incident in San Bernardino earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 Investigators are obviously devoting significant resources and time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got hundreds of federal law enforcement officials who are working closely with local law enforcement officials who are working basically around the clock at this point to learn as much as they possibly can about the attackers, their background, their potential motives.\xc2\xa0 This includes things like their foreign travel, their contacts with other individuals, their use of social media.\xc2\xa0 And it means that there are some details of that investigation starting to dribble out, sometimes in garbled form.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to share new details or to confirm details that are currently reported.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the investigators to put out information to the public that have an understandable, legitimate interest in understanding exactly what transpired.\xc2\xa0 But they will do that consistent with their judgment about what best serves the investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I am aware that the FBI is planning to provide you with some updates, at least before the end of the day today.\xc2\xa0 So that all being said, I will take a shot at answering your questions as best I can.</p>\n<p>\n\tJosh, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to release new details or confirm them about the investigation, but I will ask you to provide some reaction to details that law enforcement authorities have released, such as the fact that the woman in this attack, Tashfeen Malik, apparently had pledged allegiance to ISIS in a Facebook post.\xc2\xa0 Now that that information has been disseminated, does the White House believe that it would be accurate to characterize this as a terrorist attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, there is information that has been disseminated, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to confirm it.\xc2\xa0 So again, when the FBI has information that they have obtained that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to release publicly, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0 And until that time, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to confirm these reports.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just say in general, though, as an attempt to answer your question, without confirming that information, the FBI is leading this investigation, as the President said yesterday, because of the possibility that this is a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 And the President summoned his national security advisor, his top counterterrorism advisor, his Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, and the Deputy Director of Homeland Security to the Oval Office yesterday to get an update about what exactly transpired, and to make sure they understand how determined he is to get to the bottom of what exactly transpired.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the FBI and law enforcement officials and intelligence officials and others are doing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re using the significant resources of the United States government to learn as much as they can about what exactly transpired.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been getting regular updates, including as recently as this morning.\xc2\xa0 But it will be the responsibility of the investigators to make information public when they have concluded that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t harm the investigation to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you about a rather stunning scene that played out on live television just a few moments before we came out here, in which reporters and television crews broadcasting live were permitted into the home of these killers and allowed to broadcast all kinds of passports, photos, ID cards that were left in there.\xc2\xa0 Since the FBI is, as you said, running this investigation, and the landlord said this was handed back to him by authorities, does the White House think that that was an appropriate decision by the FBI to allow that to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this ongoing investigation is being led by the FBI, but in close coordination with local law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 And for decisions about the investigation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to either local or federal law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have complete confidence in the way that the FBI is carrying out this investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course he does.\xc2\xa0 Again, there are significant resources, investigative resources that are being dedicated to getting to the bottom of what exactly transpired, to learning as much as we possibly can about the shooters, about their foreign travel, about their foreign contacts, about their use of social media, about their potential motives.\xc2\xa0 And that work is well underway.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any reaction from either the President or from officials here at the White House who are closely following this investigation at seeing that level of detail of things that appear to be sensitive made public in that fashion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the President about this.\xc2\xa0 I saw some of the footage on television, but just watching it like the rest of you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to be meeting today with some gun control advocates.\xc2\xa0 What will his message be to them in terms of what they can expect from the administration about further steps to reduce gun violence?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, the administration is in an open dialogue with outside organizations and with those who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion for taking some common-sense steps to make it harder for those with bad intentions to get their hands on guns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is obviously important work that the administration has been quite focused on.\xc2\xa0 And the administration has worked closely with some of these outside groups to amplify the call of people across the country so that members of Congress can be responsive to those public priorities.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the intended effect.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, we saw just yesterday that Republicans stood up once again with the NRA and in the face of common sense to vote down a measure that would close the loophole on background checks.\xc2\xa0 Currently, individuals can purchase firearms over the Internet and at a gun show without going through a background check.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it doesn\'t make any sense if we\'re actually committed to making it harder for individuals that are criminals, that are the subject of a court order, or have mental problems -- documented mental problems.\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it so easy for them to get a gun.\xc2\xa0 And we can do that without undermining the basic rights of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0 But once again, Republicans blocked that effort, and Republicans also blocked the effort to make it illegal for people who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple question:\xc2\xa0 Why on Earth do we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea for somebody that the government thinks is too dangerous to board a plane to be allowed to buy a gun?\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t make any sense.\xc2\xa0 But once again, Republicans block legislation that would make that illegal.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got some additional work to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the White House concerned at all that just days after this shooting, the apartment where the suspect shooters lived was not secured?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, for how and whether that specific location was secured, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the FBI and to local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to put a finer point on it, is the White House at all concerned today that reporters were allowed to just walk through that scene?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the White House is focused on is making sure that our investigators get to the bottom of what exactly transpired; that they conduct the kind of thorough investigation that will allow us to learn as much as we possibly can about the individuals who carried out this terrible act and about their potential motivations; and frankly, to learn what we can to try to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what they\'re focused on.\xc2\xa0 So again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the FBI and local law enforcement about whether the media access that was granted earlier today is going to have any impact on their ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, you\'re not prepared to say whether the White House is concerned about that at all, during the investigation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, for any impact that that may have on the ongoing investigation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the investigators.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How worried should Americans be -- just to take a step back for a second -- about the risk posed by copycats or self-radicalized people in America?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as he mentioned yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to be vigilant.\xc2\xa0 And I think people can be vigilant knowing that the United States government, particularly since 9/11 -- going back to 9/11 -- has been quite focused on securing the homeland and securing the American people.\xc2\xa0 And in the aftermath of 9/11, so much was learned about what the government can do to better orient our defenses to keep the American people safe.\xc2\xa0 And in the years since, there have been a number of steps that have been taken to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo one thing that happened in the aftermath of 9/11 was we more effectively fused our law enforcement, our military, and our intelligence capabilities to make sure that when information was coming in it was being properly shared with relevant authorities and that action could be taken to secure the homeland.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we knew was important for us to do is to strengthen the coordination between federal law enforcement and military intelligence authorities, and local law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 These first responders are on the front lines of keeping communities across the country safe.\xc2\xa0 And we have strengthened those relationships.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of millions of dollars a year that is provided by the federal government to local communities all across the country to make those communities safer and more resilient, and more effective at preventing these kinds of actions from taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\tA lot of effort, as we discussed at some length yesterday, has been invested in countering violent extremism and making sure that we have a robust effort, particularly online, to counter the radical messaging that we see from extremist organizations around the country and around the world.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that while we have made progress in countering that message, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more than can be done to make those efforts more effective, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in a variety of ways, we have actually seen the important results of this work.\xc2\xa0 That can be quantified by the aggressive efforts of law enforcement to arrest people who have stated an intention to travel to Syria, for example, to fight alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We have also seen first responders act effectively to save lives and to respond to terrible incidents when they do occur.\xc2\xa0 I think the situation in Boston is a good example.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a place where we saw first responders work quickly to save the lives of people who were badly injured in that attack, and over the course of a few days bring to justice those who were responsible for carrying out that attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the response that we saw from the citizens of Boston was absolutely inspiring -- this appeal to the notion of being Boston Strong, and that just days after this terrible attack was carried out at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, tens of thousands of Bostonians turned out at Fenway Park for a baseball game.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of response and spirit and patriotism that the American people have shown in the face of this threat, and the President continues to be confident that while the U.S. government is vigilant in doing what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary -- all that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, all that\xe2\x80\x99s possible to protect the American people, that the American people can continue on with their lives with a sense of confidence about the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to follow along that line that you gave to Roberta.\xc2\xa0 In the midst of the efforts to try to find out who is radicalized, or what have you, in this nation, particularly after Paris and after what just happened in California, is there a concern?\xc2\xa0 And what level of concern is there for the fact that some of these possible suspects have gone underground because of the magnitude of the situation and the fact that they know that the FBI is conducting raids, trying to find those who sympathize with the terrorists here in this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for updates on the investigation and any raids that may or may not be conducted by the FBI, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you this, so you can understand what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, because maybe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not necessarily talking about the raid.\xc2\xa0 What is the level of concern here when it comes to finding those who are sympathizers of terrorists or sympathizers to ISIS who could possibly want to conduct something here?\xc2\xa0 And especially what is the concern of finding them when it\xe2\x80\x99s gone so public with Paris and the attempts to find people in Paris and in this country, and what happened in California?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the situation in California because there\xe2\x80\x99s still an ongoing investigation to determine exactly what transpired and what motivated those individuals to take the terrible indefensible, violent action that they took.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just say in general that the President and our national security officials have talked about how challenging it is to disrupt particularly lone-wolf attacks.\xc2\xa0 And that is work that has drawn the intense focus of law enforcement both at the state and federal level.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously something that the intelligence community is focused on, as well.\xc2\xa0 But if you take a look at the track record, and particularly the important work that is done by the FBI and the Department of Justice, their record of disrupting these kinds of plans before they\xe2\x80\x99re carried out is good and should give the American people confidence in the capabilities that we have and in the resources that are used to confront this threat.</p>\n<p>\n\tJoe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of information on the record.\xc2\xa0 Travel from Saudi to the United States.\xc2\xa0 One of these individuals from Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an amassing of weapons that we know about.\xc2\xa0 Bombs.\xc2\xa0 Are we at the point where the administration is ready to, if not concede, become concerned about the possibility of a major intelligence failure on these individuals on the West Coast?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Joe, I think at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s far too early to reach that kind of conclusion.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still learning exactly what was motivating these individuals, what steps they took to carry out this terrible act of violence.\xc2\xa0 So I think before we make any grand pronouncements along those lines, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for investigators to learn more about what exactly happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it time for the President, perhaps, to change the guidance to Americans, that they should feel confident that we are going to be able to defend ourselves, especially during the holiday season, given what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Joe, the American people can continue to be confident that the U.S. government, that our law enforcement professionals, that our intelligence professionals, that our military professionals, that those who are charged with protecting the homeland take very seriously the responsibilities that they have.\xc2\xa0 They are keenly aware of the threat that we face, and that there is an all-of-government approach that is taken to protecting the homeland, to protecting the American people, and to protecting our interests both in this country and around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about, if anything, the vetting process for Tashfeen Malik, the wife?\xc2\xa0 It does appear that she was vetted by the government to some extent before she traveled here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Joe, this is one of the things that is part of the investigation, is to learn exactly the circumstances of some of the international travel that we saw from one of the individuals who was an American citizen, and also to learn more about the circumstances that the other shooter entered the United States.\xc2\xa0 So this is the subject of an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a significant difference between the vetting of someone coming through on a K-1 fianc\xc3\xa9 visa as opposed to someone coming to the United States as a refugee from Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a good question.\xc2\xa0 And what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us say quite a bit over the last few weeks is that refugees seeking to be resettled in the United States are subjected to the most rigorous, intensive screening of anyone who attempts to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0 That process can take typically between 18 and 24 months, and including in-person interviews, the collection of biographical and biometric information, the vetting of individuals running their names through a variety of databases, including databases that are maintained by the intelligence community, by the military and by international law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe standards for individuals who enter the visa that you just described is not as strict.\xc2\xa0 And there still is information that is being collected about the circumstances of this person\xe2\x80\x99s entry.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s more to be learned on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that this was a woman on the West Coast involved in this situation, what is the implication for migration policy now?\xc2\xa0 We know in the case of refugees coming from Syria, women and children were given preference over young men of military age, for example.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States need to look into whether women should be held to a stricter standard coming from certain countries due to the fact of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve just seen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Joe, I think we -- part of this investigation is to collect information that we believe could be used to adjust our security posture to ensure that we keep the country safe. \xc2\xa0And so, again, this will be a question that our investigators will consider and that ultimately our homeland security professionals will have to evaluate, as well.\xc2\xa0 They, like all of us, are trying to follow the admonition not to jump to conclusions.\xc2\xa0 But obviously this is something that they will carefully consider.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So one that\'s slightly off-topic from what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about, do you think Paul Ryan is going to have more power with his conference than John Boehner did in the fall and get this omnibus passed?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would say that I hope so.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody in this room or in any room on Capitol Hill that relishes the prospect of a mid-December or even a late-December government shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned earlier this week, there does, however, continue to be a significant concern in this building that Republicans in Congress appear to be insisting on the inclusion of ideological riders in a budget bill.\xc2\xa0 And the inclusion of those riders does risk a government shutdown for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I don\'t think -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of support across the country for the inclusion of ideological provisions in a budget bill.\xc2\xa0 And there certainly would not be a lot of support across the country for shutting down the government about the inclusion of ideological provisions in a budget bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is, the inclusion of these ideological provisions, not surprisingly, has a rather polarizing effect in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m quite skeptical that a piece of budget legislation that includes provisions that would offer a special benefit to large companies that pollute our air and water, or benefits to the largest financial institutions on Wall Street, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of bipartisan support for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have seen -- in fact, Speaker Boehner on occasion demonstrated for us -- that trying to pass budget legislation strictly along party lines doesn\'t work, doesn\'t pass.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why hopefully Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell who preside over majorities in their respective houses of Congress will set aside those kinds of riders and focus on passing a budget in advance of next Friday\xe2\x80\x99s deadline.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think the criticism of the President in the last day seemed to be that he, in the immediate aftermath of this shooting in California, that he seemed to express sadness and frustration with Congress instead of outrage and anger at the possible terrorism-related issues here.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that the President\xe2\x80\x99s kind of at least emotional response to this was, maybe as we learn more and more about their connection to foreign terrorist organizations, maybe not quite appropriate?\xc2\xa0 That he should have been closer on the scale to sort of outrage and anger than sadness and talking about sort of domestic issues like gun access?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Gardiner, I think what the American people expect of their President is someone who is going to step up, make sure that the resources and capabilities of the federal government are properly and effectively mobilized to get to the bottom of what happened.\xc2\xa0 And that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s first response.\xc2\xa0 The President less than 24 hours after this incident occurred summoned to his office for his first meeting of the day yesterday the Director of the FBI, the Attorney General, his National Security Advisor, his top Counterterrorism Advisor, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security to sit in his office and have a conversation about what needs to be done to find out what exactly happened and what steps need to be taken as a result of that investigation to further enhance our national security.\xc2\xa0 Those are the steps that the President took, and I think those are the steps the American people expect their President to take.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the consensus of that meeting?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in hard facts?\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably what Gardiner is looking at.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the meeting was principally focused on providing the President an update about the status of the ongoing investigation, but I think the consensus was that there was shared determination among those who participated in the discussion about getting to the bottom of what exactly transpired -- learning as much as we possibly can about the individuals who carried out this vile act, exploiting their social media, learning who they had recently been in touch with, understanding the circumstances of recent foreign travel, and trying to divine their motivations, and collecting that information to paint a picture of what exactly transpired so that we can learn from this incident and, if necessary, adjust our security posture to better strengthen our homeland security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President then charge them to come up with a response within a certain amount of time, Josh?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President charged them with conducting an investigation that gets to the bottom of what exactly happened, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the stage that we\xe2\x80\x99re in right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back in July, the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to pick up our game to prevent lone-wolf attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is he confident that his homeland security team and I guess, beyond that, law enforcement around the country, has \xe2\x80\x9cpicked up the game\xe2\x80\x9d to deal with this ISIS long-wolf threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think the President would say that we have.\xc2\xa0 And I think the statistics that the Department of Justice can share with you about the number of individuals and the number of plots that have been disrupted I think is a pretty good accounting of how focused our law enforcement and our intelligence professionals are on this.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s quite challenging, and the President has talked before about how disrupting lone-wolf plots is probably the most significant challenge facing homeland security professionals these days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it -- and, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to call this a lone-wolf attack -- but is it inevitable that some will get through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is resigned to that kind of inevitably. I think the President and his national security team remain vigilant.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got national security professionals who work 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, focused on keeping the homeland safe and trying to detect these plots and disrupt them when necessary.\xc2\xa0 So this continues to get the intense focus of the President and his national security team.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he need more tools?\xc2\xa0 And have any of the changes -- the pendulum had kind of swung the other way, and you obviously, you had to do what you did with the metadata program.\xc2\xa0 is he confident that he has the tools he needs and that the homeland security team has the tools they need to deal with these threats?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our national security professionals did say that they believed that the reforms that have been instituted to the so-called 215 program do effectively preserve the capabilities that they need to protect the homeland while also enhancing the right to privacy.\xc2\xa0 There is one issue that does stand out as a particularly thorny one that\xe2\x80\x99s related to striking that balance, and that is this issue of encryption, and that there is a challenge for our law enforcement who are concerned about people who use encryption to make these kinds of plots more difficult to detect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing work sort of at a policy level.\xc2\xa0 There have been some conversations with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 There certainly have been a host of conversations with leaders in the technology community about what can be done to ensure both that we protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people -- the vast majority of law-abiding citizens that use this technology -- while also ensuring that people with bad intentions don\xe2\x80\x99t use this technology to successfully carry out an attack against the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you lean any further forward on whether or not this was terrorism?\xc2\xa0 I mean, given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned since you last spoke yesterday, the number of pipe bombs that were found, the extent of the ammunition, the apparent planning that went into this, this does not look -- you will acknowledge this does not look like workplace violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This looks like -- I mean, what it looks like is people who were obviously intent on carrying out a terrible act of violence.\xc2\xa0 But for divining their motives and getting a better sense of what their eventual plan may have been, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the FBI will need to speak to.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would the administration have to see to get to the terrorism description?\xc2\xa0 Are you sticking to this very specific FBI definition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to evaluate the information that our investigators are able to undercover and confirm.\xc2\xa0 And I think based on the information that they collect, based on where the facts lead that investigation, that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately how we\xe2\x80\x99ll draw some conclusions about what their motives were and what their broader intent may have been.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the threshold to terrorism, is what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it will require a careful examination of the facts that are collected, and better insight into what their intent may have been.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly vague, or is it -- words like \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintimidation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical motive,\xe2\x80\x9d those are things that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and those sort of fit the legal definition.\xc2\xa0 So, in some ways, there are a couple of different questions here.\xc2\xa0 One is, what are the kinds of -- what is sort of the legal classification of this, and then how should the American people understand exactly what these individuals were attempting to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a more general question.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a level of concern that the parsing of all this by the administration is adding to the anxiety of the general public out there.\xc2\xa0 Has the President received any communications from other leaders, individuals, expressing that anxiety and concern, and perhaps even confusion about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on because of this parsing of all this -- what this is and what it isn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ron, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus and the focus of his national security team is on the investigation and on the steps that are necessary to protect the homeland.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what our focus is.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no parsing that.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority is homeland security and countering terrorism and protecting the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the immigration issue, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as you said to Joe, about how the refugee process is very strict and all that, and apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s not been -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no concern about that.\xc2\xa0 The K-1 process, has that ever been something on the radar of the administration as something that we might need to look at as a way -- because there are people out there saying now that they long thought that this was a way that someone could exploit the immigration system to get into the country.\xc2\xa0 Has this ever been on the radar?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would do is I would encourage you to check with the Department of Homeland Security on this.\xc2\xa0 And they obviously are responsible for administering these programs and making sure that people who enter the country are properly vetted, consistent with their assessment about whatever risk that individual may pose.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that as all of these programs are implemented, that protecting the United States and protecting our homeland is, in fact, their top priority.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with them about whether or not any reforms have been considered in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can confirm for you is that as we learn more about this case, and as we investigate the circumstances under which this individual entered the country, that I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the potential of reforms being implemented in the future to strengthen that program if we determine that that\'s necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 In terms of homeland security, the FBI Director I think recently said that there are at least three dozen individuals who might commit violence who are under heavy surveillance in the country.\xc2\xa0 And you said a minute ago that the DOJ could tell us the number of plots that have been disrupted.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me some indication of what that number is, of plots disrupted?\xc2\xa0 And does that three dozen individuals under heavy surveillance sound about right still?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for individuals that may or may not be under surveillance, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 As it relates -- my reference to plots disrupted is that it is not uncommon for the Department of Justice to send out a news release indicating that an individual has been arrested, either because they were planning to travel to Syria or because they were planning to carry out a lone-wolf attack here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And for a compilation of those announcements, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the Department of Justice can provide that to you in relatively short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- can you tell us whether there\xe2\x80\x99s been an increase in that kind of activity -- disruption, arrests, so and so forth?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Check with the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 This is their responsibility.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they can give you some numbers that will provide some texture to that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The White House is backing a change that would ban people on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms.\xc2\xa0 You talked about it at the top of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any concerns that such a bill would deprive some Americans of a constitutional right without due process?\xc2\xa0 These are people that are suspected of something.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t been convicted or charged.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Byron, in this case there is a view that if the government has determined that it is too dangerous for you to get on an airplane, it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the administration that you should not be able to legally purchase a firearm.\xc2\xa0 There is a process for considering -- there have been well-documented incidents where people have suggested that their inclusion on the no-fly list was not appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And they had a venue for addressing that, in some cases getting that fixed.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, if we\'re talking about national security and people keeping people safe, I think the idea is a sound one.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous for you to get on an airplane, it\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous for you to purchase a gun.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can play devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Flying on an airplane --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Part of your job description.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is not a constitutional right.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court found in Heller, however, that there is a constitutional right to bear -- individuals have a constitutional right to bear arms.\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\'t there be a higher bar for depriving someone of a constitutional right than just curbing their travel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not a constitutional lawyer in a position to debate this to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to ask him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But I think the principle that we\'re operating under here is I think pretty common-sense and self-evident and one that we obviously stand firmly behind.\xc2\xa0 If the government has determined that it\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous for you to board an airplane, you should not be able to legally purchase a firearm.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President still -- does he still broadly believe in a constitutional right to bear arms?\xc2\xa0 I know he said he believes in common-sense gun safety measures.\xc2\xa0 But does he philosophically believe the Second Amendment gives Americans the individual right to bear firearms?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, he would probably give you a more drawn-out, constitutional answer.\xc2\xa0 But I think the direct answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s why every time you hear me talk about common-sense gun legislation, it is in the context of, yes, there are changes that we can make that don\'t undermine the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding American citizens.\xc2\xa0 That is a principle that the President has long advocated.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Different subject.\xc2\xa0 Highway funding -- that expires today.\xc2\xa0 Will the President sign that bill today?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any more comments on the bill that passed yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President will sign that bill as soon as it arrives at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when that will be.\xc2\xa0 And I think that you can expect a written statement from the President about that legislation.\xc2\xa0 In general, let me just say that it does reflect some positive progress.\xc2\xa0 For a long time, Congress has been passing transportation funding in small increments, several months at a time.\xc2\xa0 What we know about infrastructure projects is that the most impactful ones take years to implement and build.\xc2\xa0 And trying to carry out a years\xe2\x80\x99 long project based on monthly or several months of incremental funding is not particularly efficient or effective.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why the White House has been supportive of this compromise legislation that would fund infrastructure projects for five years.\xc2\xa0 Now, the White House has obviously put forward a proposal for increasing that funding substantially, because we believe that there is more that could be done; that there are other worthy infrastructure projects that are not being built right now because funding is not available.\xc2\xa0 And if we were able to initiate those projects it would both create jobs in the short term, but also do something important for our economy over the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99d say about this is that it is, like any piece of bipartisan legislation, a compromise.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a perfect bill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there are some things about the bill that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t love.\xc2\xa0 There are some things about the bill that Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t love.\xc2\xa0 But by identifying some common ground, Democrats and Republicans in Congress were able to do something good for the country and good for our economy.\xc2\xa0 We hope that members of Congress will take precisely the same approach in passing a budget bill before December 11th.</p>\n<p>\n\tJames.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 First, on health care, the Senate passed an outright repeal of Obamacare, and I just would like to have your reaction to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Congress on a number of occasions pass legislation with the goal of repealing Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to report to you that once again Republicans have failed in that effort.\xc2\xa0 And I know there are a lot of Republican presidential candidates on the campaign trail who talk about how weak and ineffectual Republicans in Washington, D.C. are, and they often hold up the failure, despite strong Republican majorities in Congress, to repeal Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 It looks like they\xe2\x80\x99ve got their latest example.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that Obamacare is now the law of the land and has survived some Supreme Court challenge, is it the position of the administration that the fact that something is the law of the land should allow it to stand and that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be challenged once is it so established?\xc2\xa0 In other words, there are some things that become the law of the land that subsequently time reveals have been bad law, right?\xc2\xa0 And obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say Obamacare is bad law, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to suggest, are you, that people should cease challenging it simply because it\xe2\x80\x99s the law of the land?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, James, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually said since the law passed is that the President would be willing to work with Democrats or Republicans, people on either side of the aisle, who had a genuine desire to try to strengthen the law.\xc2\xa0 And there are a couple of examples -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have them in front of me, but a couple of examples of bills that the President has signed earlier this year that represent very small but still represent improvements to the law.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the President continues to believe that there may be additional steps that can be taken to strengthen the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the frustration that the administration has felt is that time and time again, the goal of Republicans has been not to strengthen the law but rather to undermine it.\xc2\xa0 And just to serve as one example here, this latest piece of legislation that the Senate voted on, according to the CBO, if it were to pass, it would actually prevent 22 million Americans from getting health insurance.\xc2\xa0 That certainly does not represent a strengthening of the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick topics, please.\xc2\xa0 I saw your comments yesterday from the podium to the effect that the President supports the decision that was reached by Secretary Carter to open up all combat roles to women.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a view on whether, given the fact that now this gender standard has been removed from the question of combat operations, similarly we should see the removal of the gender standard where the Selective Service is concerned?\xc2\xa0 As you know, only men are required to register for the Selective Service for the possible restoration of the draft.\xc2\xa0 Should that gender standard also be removed now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the thing that I learned shortly before coming out here is that this is actually something that the Department of Defense is taking a look at.\xc2\xa0 And as part of the Department of Defense offering notification to Congress about this change, the Department of Defense provided an analysis about any impact that this decision would have on the Selective Service Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress to look at that analysis, to review it, and sort of get others\xe2\x80\x99 opinions to determine if additional reforms or changes to the act are necessary in light of this specific decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has not conveyed to Secretary Carter any view on it so far?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He has not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 I want to pick up on some of Ron\xe2\x80\x99s questioning earlier.\xc2\xa0 As you know, administration critics have long suggested that there is a kind of deficit to the President\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric when it comes to terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And this argument has taken many forms.\xc2\xa0 For example, there was widespread dissatisfaction when the administration initially referred to the Fort Hood shootings as an example of workplace violence and it was later fairly well established that that was an act of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a situation right now that for all intents and purposes appears to be an act of terrorism, where the administration is reluctant seemingly to say so.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the question about whether or not the President should properly be making reference to Islam jihadism or radical Islamist terrorism as opposed to just violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 These are questions that go, as you know, to the rhetorical function of the presidency.\xc2\xa0 And so I just ask you, does this President have a problem with his rhetoric where terrorism is concerned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe in the mind of his critics, but he certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t when it comes to his resolve in confronting terrorism and keeping the country safe.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have redoubled our efforts to secure the homeland.\xc2\xa0 It is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this President build and lead an international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The reason that the President has initiated 8,000 airstrikes on the part of our coalition against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria is because the President is determined to do everything we can to prevent ISIL from establishing a safe haven that they could then use to\xc2\xa0plot and even carry out attacks against the United States or our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The thrust of the criticism is that as a Commander-in-Chief, President Obama will always be handicapped in his ability to really effectively confront this threat precisely because he isn\xe2\x80\x99t properly defining it in his rhetoric or therefore in his own mind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess, James, the fact that our harshest critics, that the best criticism that they can come up with is to criticize what the President says, I think is a pretty strong endorsement of all the actions that the President has taken to keep the country safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I only identified it as one strain of criticism.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t identify it as the best that they have.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Fair enough, fair enough.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is it fair to say that the White House will hold off on any policy response, perhaps executive action on gun control, until after the full investigation of San Bernardino concludes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline for you to share with you in terms of any additional executive actions that the administration may take to put in place some common-sense gun safety policies.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily say that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I ask because you\xe2\x80\x99ve emphasized you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to name it until you really know what happened in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 Do you also have to wait then before it\xe2\x80\x99s determined what type of terrorism or type of workplace violence before the President does something in terms of a policy change?\xc2\xa0 Or is there pressure to look responsive and to look like the President is acting in response to an event that has scared a lot of people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, are you talking just specifically about gun safety policies?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking more generally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A policy shift, a policy change, a policy response --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 With regard to homeland security or our campaign against ISIL?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about any of these things?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about any and all of those things.\xc2\xa0 I guess that gets to the idea of whether you need to name it and know exactly what it is before you respond to it.\xc2\xa0 Because we have heard from the President very specific policy prescriptions he has to access to guns that isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily applicable as yet to the attack in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 The no-fly list, for example, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to these two individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, based on information that is uncovered in the investigation, if there is information that is collected that highlights a needed change in our security posture, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll implement that change immediately.\xc2\xa0 And there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any hesitation to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the conclusion of an investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think even in the course of an investigation.\xc2\xa0 If we learn that there is a significant homeland security vulnerability -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that will be the conclusion or even something that is uncovered in the context of this investigation -- but if it is, securing the homeland continues to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a step that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take right away.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to these questions of gun safety policies, or executive actions that could make it harder for individuals who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have guns from getting them, that has been something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on for a long time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on in advance of this latest incident.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess in some ways -- we had a little bit of a discussion about this yesterday about whether or not there are specific steps the President could have taken to prevent this specific situation.\xc2\xa0 And so one question is, well, why is it important to, for example, pass a law that prevents anybody on the no-fly list from buying a gun if we knew that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have prevented the situation in San Bernardino?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess the thing that I would say is, are you suggesting, therefore, that we should wait until somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s on the no-fly list walks into a gun store in America, purchases an assault weapon, and kills a bunch of Americans before we pass that law?\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a very good way to either run public policy or to run the greatest country in America.\xc2\xa0 We should be taking common-sense steps now that we know will make the country safer.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is advocating.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked that because in that sort of climate of fear, critics are saying -- they sort of call for the President to do something, whatever that something is.\xc2\xa0 Is that not something that the White House thinks is a valid criticism, or perhaps that\'s the wrongheaded response to act during the immediate aftermath of an attack?\xc2\xa0 Is there an approach of how to go forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach is to be very focused on facts, on evidence.\xc2\xa0 The facts will guide the investigation.\xc2\xa0 And based on the facts that are uncovered, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take whatever steps are necessary to protect the country and to protect the homeland.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you as well, separately -- in that culture of fear, is the White House concerned about backlash against the Muslim community, specifically?\xc2\xa0 Whether or not this radicalism or violence was inspired by that, there is among some the perception and certainly rhetoric in public space linking that violence to Islam because that was the religion of the two attackers?\xc2\xa0 Is that specifically a concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has expressed his concern about some of the grossly irresponsible -- and in some cases, outright bigoted -- political rhetoric that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard over the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President does not believe that that is consistent with American values.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe, importantly, that that makes the country safer.\xc2\xa0 In fact, President George W. Bush was somebody who keenly understood that targeting Muslims or somehow marginalizing them only advances the narratives of our enemies.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why President George W. Bush went out of his way to make clear that the United States and the West are not at war with Islam.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\'re at war with extremists who are capitalize -- who are trying to capitalize on some vulnerable populations, including many Muslims to try to inspire them to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that the United States, the American people, and the American government need to work with the millions of patriotic Muslim Americans in this country to make our country safer, and to make it harder, if not outright prevent extremist organizations from radicalizing vulnerable members of their community.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s very challenging work, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something that has attracted a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that I would commend to your attention that I noticed earlier today is this op-ed in the New York Times by an American Muslim who is a naval reservist.\xc2\xa0 His name is Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, and he writes very persuasively about some of the issues that you raise.\xc2\xa0 And he cited specifically the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s community outreach program in Minneapolis, where we saw the U.S. government and some law enforcement elements of the U.S. government work effectively with a local Muslim community in Minneapolis to counter radicalization efforts and, in some cases, even prevent terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat kind of coordination is critical to our ongoing success, and it is a priority of this administration.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, it was the priority of the previous administration, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that President Bush certainly deserves a lot of credit for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the need for additional security?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there have been threats against mosques.\xc2\xa0 There is certainly a perception among the Muslim community that they are being viewed with scrutiny right now.\xc2\xa0 Is there a need, or was that discussed in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday of looking at the security of mosques and other institutions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware to what degree that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are local officials, including local law enforcement officials that are quite concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think this is the kind of question that local law enforcement will consider, and obviously they can count on the support of the United States to target people, based on their religion, runs directly counter to the founding principles and values of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Now that the Senate has blocked the effort to bar people on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms, is that an area where the White House believes President Obama has executive authority to tighten those rules?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is that on the list of proposals that the President is scrubbing as he considers executive action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jordan, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of the ongoing work to scrub the law, as the President described it.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the group of individuals who are working on that have cast a wide net in doing so, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you at this point on what they\xe2\x80\x99re considering or when they may be prepared to make an announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrancesca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions kind of tying up all this talk about terrorism today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with a follow-up on the most recent one.\xc2\xa0 You were specifically asked if the President fears that Muslims could be attacked in retaliation -- the specific word being used is \xe2\x80\x9cbacklash,\xe2\x80\x9d and that is because his own Attorney General said yesterday evening that her greatest fear is that there could be a backlash against the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 So I just wanted to ask one more time, possibly more directly, does the President fear that there could be a backlash against Muslims because of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has been disturbed at a lot of the political rhetoric that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen directed at Muslims, and the President has spoken about that I think quite forcefully over the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I think the President is confident that the vast majority of Americans understand this core principle that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t targeted for violence based on their religious beliefs.\xc2\xa0 That is a core value of our country.\xc2\xa0 That is a value that is worth defending.\xc2\xa0 It is also a value that is broadly shared by just about every American.\xc2\xa0 If there are some specific steps that need to be taken to protect a mosque against a specific threat, I have total confidence that local law enforcement is committed to that effort.\xc2\xa0 And if they need the support of the federal government, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they will receive it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it has been instrumental to our efforts against groups like al Qaeda and ISIS and other terrorist organizations to make clear that the United States is at war with those organizations, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not at war with Islam.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not at war with Muslims around the world.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there are a number of Muslim countries that have joined the U.S. coalition against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re invested in this effort.\xc2\xa0 There are patriotic American Muslims serving in our military right now to keep this country safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd all of that undermines one of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful weapons, which is their narrative that they are the inheritor of the legacy and message and inspiration of Islam, and that they are using all of that to wage a war against the West.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fantasy.\xc2\xa0 It is not true.\xc2\xa0 And any effort to marginalize Muslims in this country only advances that narrative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama and President Bush and other leaders in this country who have stood up to make that clear deserve a lot of credit, because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for our country, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for our national security, and it is entirely consistent with the basic founding principles and values of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that leads me to my second question.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the threshold for terrorism, just to take that a little bit further and put up a threshold for radical Islamic terrorism, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying to me that the President is never going to call it that.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what the results of this FBI investigation are, that the threat -- I guess my question is, what is the threshold?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that\xe2\x80\x99s never going to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the President is going to take all the steps that he believes are necessary to protect the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that he believes is critically important to protecting the United States of America is undermining the narrative that is advanced by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And to seek to marginalize or isolate Muslims in America or anywhere else only serves to advance that narrative.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he won\xe2\x80\x99t call it radical Islamic terrorism?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, let me do the week ahead and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys get started on your weekends.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President and the First Lady will attend -- well, they\xe2\x80\x99ll host and attend the congressional holiday ball here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will participate in a DNC roundtable here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will travel to the United States Capitol to deliver remarks at an event commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 13th Amendment.\xc2\xa0 The President will be joined by members of both the House and the Senate, including congressional leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus in marking this historic event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat afternoon, the President will welcome Israeli President Rivlin to the White House for a meeting.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing with President Rivlin a range of issues of common focus, including the unprecedented bilateral security cooperation between the United States and Israel, regional developments, combatting extremism in all its forms, and the need for genuine advancement of peace between Israelis and Palestinians and a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 President Rivlin will also be an honored guest at the White House\xe2\x80\x99s annual Hanukkah reception following the meeting between the two Presidents.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday and Friday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House, and hopefully in that period of time the President will be signing a budget agreement to avert a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, hope you all have an excellent weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>\n\t1:56 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
