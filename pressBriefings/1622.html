EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 So I didn\'t -- first, I\'m glad to be here.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t expect that the off-camera part -- first, it\'s not my decision, but I\'ll do it.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'ll have to have a discussion as to why I\'m not considered physically presentable.\xc2\xa0 But never mind.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I just wanted to say that, from the impressions I\'ve been getting in this meeting, I think it\'s been going very well.\xc2\xa0 As you well noted, the President has brought many of this top senior leaders in his team together that signifies the importance he puts on this summit meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of energy, I want to reiterate that the problems this Western Hemisphere faces in terms of energy and climate change are problems that are very serious, that this is a new administration that has definitely -- taking the United States in a different direction, that we regard the energy and climate change problems as something that we in the Western Hemisphere, indeed we in the world, have to face together.</div> <div class="legacy-para">There are other issues that have been discussed at this conference.\xc2\xa0 Since I\'m, you know, I\'m the Energy Secretary, I\'ll confine my remarks mostly to that.\xc2\xa0 But I think there -- my feeling is that there is this new mood, that we\'ve come here with an outreach and open hand to start a new chapter in the relationships with the Americas.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I\'m very optimistic, the President is very optimistic that good things come of this.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve announced today that we would like to establish a framework, an energy framework, and a climate change framework.\xc2\xa0 Previous to this meeting, the day before, the President and his group were in Mexico where it was announced -- a similar energy framework was announced in Mexico to cooperate on energy and climate change issues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We have ongoing relationships with Mexico on some programs, mutual cooperation, both on energy efficiency and the development of new sources of energy.\xc2\xa0 We are entering discussions with Chile; we have entered into agreements and mutual help with Brazil on biofuels and, in particular, for us fourth-generation biofuels using lignocellulose and converting it to not only ethanol but fuels beyond ethanol.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So there are many things that are starting.\xc2\xa0 And again, we are very hopeful that many countries in the Western Hemisphere will join in this energy and climate change framework.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Do you want to, before I turn it over for questions --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Forgive the association of your good looks with the rest of ours lack of the same.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President just wrapped up the third plenary.\xc2\xa0 It was a very good discussion.\xc2\xa0 It was basically a wide-ranging discussion on democratic governance.\xc2\xa0 It included interventions from six or eight heads of state or heads of government from the region, each of whom outlined their views of -- principally of the challenges facing the hemisphere but also their hopes as it relates to U.S. relations with the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Notwithstanding the speaker and the ideological predisposition of each speaker, there was, I think it\'s fair to say, uniform enthusiasm for what Secretary Chu outlined, which is the open hand and openness with which President Obama and his team of very senior officials came to town to represent.\xc2\xa0 The President did not speak or did not intercede in this particular session, but took copious notes and commented afterwards that he appreciated the free flow of conversation and communication very much.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Over lunch, as we suggested to some of you yesterday, the President was looking for an opportunity to meet one on one with several leaders in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 So over lunch he asked to be seated next to President Uribe of Colombia and President Garcia of Peru -- had very productive discussions with both.\xc2\xa0 Robert gave you a little bit of a sense earlier today of what the President is doing on the free trade agreement and Ambassador Kirk was of course a topic of considerable discussion with President Uribe.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And he is going to -- he has requested to be seated with President Preval of Haiti and President Bachalet of Chile at tonight\'s supper.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll look forward to discussing a range of bilateral and regional issues with them, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">That\'s all I have.</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Before you start questions, I forgot to mention something.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to repeat what the President said in the plenary session on energy.\xc2\xa0 The first thing he said is that the lowest-hanging fruit in decreasing the carbon footprint of the world is to emphasize energy efficiency; that, using the example of the refrigerators in the United States, due to increasing standards, the refrigerators have increased their energy efficiency four times -- fourfold, so that the average refrigerator in the United States today uses four times less energy than it did in 1975, even though the average size went up; that it doesn\'t cost more money.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the inflation-adjusted price of refrigerators went down by a factor of two, because the better insulation meant you could build a smaller compressor, which is the most costly part of the refrigerator; that the amount of energy saved in refrigerators in the United States is significant.\xc2\xa0 The energy saved, had we been using the 1974 standard refrigerators today, we\'re now saving more energy than all of the renewable energy in wind, solar, thermal, photovoltaic generation in the U.S. today.\xc2\xa0 Over 3 percent of the energy in the United States is saved in refrigerators alone.</div> <div class="legacy-para">He went on to say that building efficiency is the next big challenge; that one could reduce the electricity costs in buildings by as much as 40 percent.\xc2\xa0 It would mean that the United States can go on and dramatically decrease the use of energy and save a lot of money; that energy efficiency, that kind of energy efficiency, is something the United States is going to strive very hard to achieve; that we will be working to help and discuss and compare notes with everybody; that energy efficiency will benefit anyone in the Americas.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Consider if you\'re an oil and gas exporting country.\xc2\xa0 The oil and gas you can sell abroad will bring in hard cash, that it increase the prosperity, that that energy you save in your own country means you can sell more abroad.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so there -- energy efficiency and conservation will help everybody and dramatically decrease the carbon footprint.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the things that\'s very, very important.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Going beyond that, the development of new sources of energy, the United States is looking forward to working with as many people as possible, not only -- especially in the Americas, but over the world -- in developing new sources of clean energy; that this is something that -- the impacts of climate change, as the world goes forward, we learn more about what has happened and what is happening and what will happen is becoming more frightening each succeeding year; that the irony of these climate change scenarios and predictions is that, in many instances, the poorest countries all suffer who -- countries that had very little to do with the predicament we\'re in will suffer disproportionately, and the United States is aware of that, sensitive to that, and now is -- wants to show some leadership in this respect.\xc2\xa0 And also, going forward, that this is something that, again, it\'s not only the poorer peoples of the world that will suffer disproportionately, but going forward to our children and their children, they will suffer disproportionately.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So the irony is that the most innocent parts of our population are the ones that will bear what we\'re doing today.\xc2\xa0 And this message is something that the entire world has to take note of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so the President feels very strongly that this climate change issue, wrapped up with the energy issue, wrapped up with all these things, is a very important part of his agenda.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Laura.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, in your discussions about energy, did the question of the tariff on Brazilian ethanol come up?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that was addressed in any forum?\xc2\xa0 And has the position changed at all on that?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And let me just get my second question out, which may be for Denis, which is, during the conversations with President Uribe at lunch, did they come -- make any progress on the issue of the free trade issue or the labor questions or was it a more general conversation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to be meeting with the Brazilian representative tomorrow, so our answer to your question is it\'s not come up, but let me also say that the U.S. and Brazil are working together going forward on many things having to do with biofuels.\xc2\xa0 I think the United States, and particularly the Department of Energy, is investing a great deal in developing new methods of converting lignocelluose into biofuels -- not only ethanol, but into gasoline- and diesel-like fuels that can be blended at any ratio.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so this technology we want to make available to the world.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it will benefit Brazil as well because of their bagasse.\xc2\xa0 And so it\'s something that has great promise to many countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 If you can use lumber wastes, if you can use agriculture wastes like wheat straw, rice straw, corn stover, bagasse and convert it into a diesel-like fuel, a jet plane-like fuel, a gasoline-like fuel, this will help a lot of countries\' problems.\xc2\xa0 Many countries are spending a considerable amount of their income on transportation fuel.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And this is not completely a dream.\xc2\xa0 Already the Department of Energy laboratories have developed a yeast and bacteria that actually takes simple sugars and turn them into gasoline- and diesel-like fuels today.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not practical, but in six months of research that was already done.\xc2\xa0 And so maybe in several years we can hope that we can begin to test and pilot this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 Laura, let me just preface my comments by saying that I think you see why, given both the expertise that Secretary Chu has, as well as just what he elucidated, in terms of the impact of climate on those least responsible for the situation -- is one of the reasons the President has expanded the National Security Council to include the Department of Energy and the Secretary of Energy on it.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s one of the reasons the President invited Secretary Chu on the trip.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s also one of the reasons the President is so excited to have him on the National Security Council.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">As it relates to Colombia, I think I would characterize the President when he -- it was just the three leaders; none of us were in there with him, so I debriefed with him.\xc2\xa0 And I would describe his characterization of the discussion as fruitful.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t elucidate any particular progress on it except I think it would be worth your while if you want to write the story or you want more on this to ask the Colombians their view of it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s -- I think they would have a not dissimilar view of the conversation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Scott.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, I think one for Secretary Chu and one for Denis.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, in your discussions about climate change and the seriousness of it, are you getting any -- does anyone disagree with your assessment of it?\xc2\xa0 I\'m thinking of an oil-exporting country, an OPEC member like Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 Are they raising concerns that maybe -- that the characterization of just how grave this is is wrong?</div> <div class="legacy-para">And just for Denis, why didn\'t the President speak in the plenary session on the -- on democracy?\xc2\xa0 Was it just he wasn\'t invited to?\xc2\xa0 You have, you know, questions about Chavez\'s tactics against the opposition, Daniel Ortega\'s, as well, and a democratic movement of secession in Bolivia.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if that was part of the discussion and why did the President want to join that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Well, I had no discussions in this summit meeting on the issue as to whether the climate is really changing or what are potential economic consequences.\xc2\xa0 Now, in full candor, I haven\'t talked with representatives from Venezuela yet, but I think they\'re -- in terms of discussing whether the climate is changing or whether humans have caused it, I think for the most part this debate is over.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something -- yes, it\'s changing; that\'s a demonstrable fact.\xc2\xa0 If one looks at the latest IPCC reports, there\'s very, very convincing evidence -- very high probability it was caused predominantly by greenhouse gas emissions.\xc2\xa0 And what is not known with certainty is what are the range of effects that might happen, and -- because that, quite frankly, also depends on what the world does.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But let me just say that there are certainly a reasonable probability that -- I\'m sure the people in this room have heard this -- that in the last IPCC report, the 2007 report, they said that it\'s going to be somewhere between two and four -- two and a half, four and a half -- I\'m not sure of the exact numbers -- degrees Centigrade change.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so let me remind you that the Earth has already warmed up by about 0.8 degrees Centigrade; that the experts acknowledge that there is another 1 degree Centigrade already built into the system, even if humans stopped carbon emissions today flat.\xc2\xa0 That\'s because we put enough greenhouse gases up into the atmosphere, the sun continues to warm up the Earth, and until you reach a new equilibrium or the heat from the Earth then reaches the equilibrium -- what\'s coming in and what\'s getting reflected back -- there\'s 1 degree change already; that there\'s a reasonable probability we can go above 4 degrees Centigrade to 5 and 6 more.\xc2\xa0 That means we have a -- there\'s a reasonable probability, and certainly in business-as-usual scenario, we can go to 5 or 6 degrees Centigrade.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Now, what does that mean?\xc2\xa0 The last ice age, we were 6 degrees Centigrade colder than we are today -- a very different world.\xc2\xa0 Okay, only 6 degrees Centigrade means, in North America, ice sheet from Canada down to Pennsylvania, Ohio -- year round in ice.\xc2\xa0 So imagine a world 6 degrees warmer.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to recognize geographical boundaries.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to recognize anything.\xc2\xa0 So agriculture regions today will be wiped out.\xc2\xa0 Yes, there are parts of Canada will be -- can grow more food, but, you know, the other thing is, the Earth is spherical and the sun hits at an angle up north.\xc2\xa0 So there are going to be huge consequences if we go up to that 4, 5, 6 degrees.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long would it take?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about that temperature in -- by the end of this century.\xc2\xa0 And the other thing is, you stick that carbon in the atmosphere, it cycles around, but it\'s up there for a couple hundred years.\xc2\xa0 Okay, so you\'ve just bought a couple hundred years of this effect.\xc2\xa0 So -- and that could have dramatic consequences on the world, but especially the more vulnerable people in the world.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu, so did any of the leaders, especially from this part of the world, talk about the specific concerns about rising ocean levels?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Yes, very much so.\xc2\xa0 I think the Caribbean countries face rising oceans and they face increase in the severity of hurricanes.\xc2\xa0 This is something that is very, very scary to all of us; that if you consider what has been happening, especially in the polar regions in the north, and you look at the predictions of the IPCC beginning in 1990, this is something they didn\'t do so well.\xc2\xa0 It\'s melting considerably faster than anyone predicted ten years ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So\xc2\xa0we are terribly afraid there will be an increase in temperature if the ice in the Antarctica and Greenland melt.\xc2\xa0 This is bad news.\xc2\xa0 If Greenland melts -- it\'s two or three kilometers thick -- we\'re looking at a seven-meter sea level rise around the world.\xc2\xa0 Some island states will disappear.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So there was specific -- at the lunch today, there was specific discussion represented from the island states that this is of great concern, and the island states in the world represent -- I remember this number -- one-half of 1 percent of the carbon emissions in the world.\xc2\xa0 And they will -- some of them will disappear.\xc2\xa0 So this is pretty serious business.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- let me just go back and I\'ll ask -- answer Scott\'s second question.\xc2\xa0 The President, I think as you\'ve heard him say before, thinks it\'s very important that he listen, and he took that opportunity today in the third plenary; he had been heard in the first and second plenaries.\xc2\xa0 He also -- just a reminder, Scott, that he had a meeting this morning with UNASUR and had an opportunity to obviously hear but also to be heard on these issues at that time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on that last question that he had, just -- what about U.S. shorelines, though?\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about some of these island states may disappear and sea levels may rise drastically, but then what about the U.S. shorelines and what are you doing as a precaution to try to stave that off other than just building it up with sand?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Well, if -- in certain scenarios, one could see as much as -- well, the official -- let me state what the official IPCC prediction is:\xc2\xa0 It could go up as much as three-quarters of a meter in this century, but there is a reasonable probability it could be much higher than that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And if you go up three meters, for example -- even if you go up one meter, a lot of the seashore land -- Florida, around Louisiana, New Orleans -- three meters, much, much -- there will be lots of newly defined beachfront property.\xc2\xa0 Lots of area in Florida will go under.\xc2\xa0 New Orleans at three-meter height is in great peril -- you just don\'t build bigger dikes, something like that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So the United States will certainly -- if you look at, you know, the Bay Area, where I came from, all three airports would be under water -- three meter high.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So this is -- this is serious stuff.\xc2\xa0 There\'s -- the impacts could be enormous.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so what -- what is at issue here is you can look at the average prediction of what might happen, but then there is also, let\'s say somewhere out on the wing with a 25 percent probability, a 10 percent probability, you can enter what we call, what the scientists call a tipping point.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Let me give you one example.\xc2\xa0 If the tundra warms up, as it\'s warming up -- and we actually see this -- as the tundra warms up, there\'s a lot of carbon that\'s been accumulating for millennia in the frozen tundra.\xc2\xa0 This is in Siberia; this is in Canada, Greenland.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot of vegetation.\xc2\xa0 It grows very slowly but when it falls down it doesn\'t rot.\xc2\xa0 In the Brazilian rain forest, the microbes actually recycle the vegetation very quickly.\xc2\xa0 They turn it back into carbon dioxide, methane, and up it goes and it just cycles around.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The tundra has been slowly, over thousands -- millions of years been accumulating carbon.\xc2\xa0 If the tundra thaws, those microbes wake up.\xc2\xa0 They begin to digest that carbon and begin to release it.\xc2\xa0 And so it\'s a very sudden tipping point, because it\'s just -- the analogy is you have this experienced in your own refrigerator.\xc2\xa0 You have a piece of meat; it\'s in the refrigerator, can last for three or four days.\xc2\xa0 You put it in the freezer, it can last a long, long time.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 The microbes aren\'t as active.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just a few degrees difference.\xc2\xa0 Means they wake up.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So what has come to pass in the last five years is there\'s a deeper-growing concern that if these microbes wake up, they begin to release carbon at a rate that could exceed all of human emissions, which means it\'s out of our control.\xc2\xa0 And there could be more carbon in the tundra than is in the atmosphere today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So that\'s the tipping point.\xc2\xa0 How much do you -- how close do you want to get to that?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to say, we\'re willing to gamble; there\'s only a 50 percent chance that will happen?\xc2\xa0 And when we -- oh, by the way, when that happens, don\'t see three meters.\xc2\xa0 See much -- see deserts all over the place.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So see -- ice age, us, us to a new world.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a tipping point.\xc2\xa0 So that well exceeds anything in the IPCC report.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Now, why didn\'t they include this in the IPCC report?\xc2\xa0 Because it was considered, well, we didn\'t know enough to be really sure, so we\'ll just say, yes, it\'s a concern -- and there\'s a few paragraphs in there, but it\'s not folded into their official predictions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu, if --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question of Denis, is that okay?\xc2\xa0 No offense, Secretary Chu.\xc2\xa0 President Chavez put out a statement today saying that he was reconsidering -- he was considering sending an ambassador back to Washington; he had talked to Secretary Clinton and there was going to be talks.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you knew any of this or could elaborate on any of it, maybe Dan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- do you know?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t, but we\'ll get somebody.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, can I follow up on the democracy aspect?\xc2\xa0 Did anybody else -- I know that President Obama didn\'t speak during plenary three, as you said -- I\'m taking your word for it -- did anybody else speak up on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 I hope you have no reason not to.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did any other countries at all say anything, hint at Venezuela, hint at Chavez, that they were concerned about the state of democracy in that country?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 Boy, you know, we\'re careful to not characterize other people\'s comments, in keeping with tradition.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\'s fair to say that -- I think as the President did in his opening remarks last night, I think there\'s a deep appreciation throughout the hemisphere of the recognition that elections are very important to democracy, but that\'s not the only indicator thereof.\xc2\xa0 The President talked last night about corruption, talked about capable police forces, talked about judiciary and the rule of law.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think it\'s fair to say that that was a strongly held view among a lot of people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did other countries step up and say something, you know, sort of hint at sort of disappointment with what\'s going on or nervousness at what\'s going on in Venezuela or Bolivia?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to characterize anybody as singling out any other particular country.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody talked about their view of governance and what are the important aspects thereto.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Venezuela in particular come up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 The President of Venezuela spoke during the session.\xc2\xa0 So Venezuela did come up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did that become the session?\xc2\xa0 Is that why President Obama didn\'t speak?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 It did not become the session and it\'s not the reason President Obama didn\'t speak.\xc2\xa0 As I suggested to Scott, President Obama thought it was very important to listen in this plenary, but he has obviously -- as with his opening remarks last night -- been very clear what his views are on this issue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No other countries, or you just won\'t say that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 The answer is still the same.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Denis, still on Cuba, coming into this Chavez and some of the others were insisting there have got to be changes, we\'ve got to talk about lifting the embargo in the final summit communiqu\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be any changes or is that going to be exactly as it was negotiated all along, as you said?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate any further changes in the communiqu\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the most recent draft -- I don\'t know if Dan has.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s fair to say that there\'s a disagreement on Cuba and the President was clear on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu, two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, after the description you\'ve just laid out about the scary scenario of global warming, do you believe that the U.S. proposal for Copenhagen to reduce greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels by 2020 is enough?</div> <div class="legacy-para">And secondly, can you discuss what exactly an energy framework means in the context of this summit?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, there are two parts of the proposal.\xc2\xa0 The President -- the first step is what you just described.\xc2\xa0 The second step is to reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050.\xc2\xa0 I think if you get on that target I think this gets us further away from getting close to a tipping point.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s the overall thing of what we want to do both in the short and near term in 2020, but also by 2050 -- 80 percent is very significant.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what the environmentalists say -- or what the Europeans say.</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the -- correct me if I\'m wrong, but I think the Europeans, 2020, would like to see a more aggressive stand.\xc2\xa0 I agree with you that they want to see that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think it\'s something that\'s under discussion.\xc2\xa0 This is -- as you well know, the United States operates with a President and a Congress and we have to agree on that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think it\'s enough?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that target is good for 2020?\xc2\xa0 Or as a scientist would you like to see the U.S. go further?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 I think that rather than debating a few percent, the best thing we can do is to get started as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And let me also say that I think -- in these scenarios you can say, this is where we\'re going to go.\xc2\xa0 But the other thing I need to remind everybody is that the Department of Energy, science and technology in general will be needed and called upon to provide the world with the solutions to get us to these 2050 targets.\xc2\xa0 I think the 2020 targets, most of that is going to be done by energy efficiency, conservation type of things.\xc2\xa0 To go to the very aggressive targets of 80 percent and more by 2050, it would be nice to have better choices; that in the past science has given us very much better choices than we thought were possible.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that is part of why I\'m here, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d still like to know if you think the U.S. should be more aggressive.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you talk about the framework -- Jeff\'s other question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Okay, the other question is the framework.\xc2\xa0 What we are looking for is actually -- we don\'t have a hard and fast idea of what the framework should be.\xc2\xa0 In fact, this is a reason to reach out.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it doesn\'t do us any good to say this is what the United States thinks the framework should be; this is meant in the spirit of collaboration to say, okay, how is it that we can mutually develop a framework not dictated by the United States but done in collaboration with the other partners.\xc2\xa0 And so this is a beginning -- this is what we\'d like to have happen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Was there any sense that you received from the leaders here that the United States needed to do more, and more rapidly, on greenhouse gases because of its sizable greenhouse gas emission footprint?\xc2\xa0 That\'s question one.\xc2\xa0 Question two:\xc2\xa0 In this global economic recession, was there any dialogue about potential economic disruptions from trying to reduce greenhouse gases, either through higher energy taxes or some other means?\xc2\xa0 I know those are sort of different views of it, but I wonder if either were expressed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I mean, there\'s a -- this is something that is always in the air and in people\'s mind -- is this the time to be thinking about climate change and something that will happen 30, 50, 80 years from now, given the worldwide global -- the global recession.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s also a recognition that, yes, we are in tremendous strains today, but you have to start working on this today, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of -- let me see, so you asked about the -- you know, is this the time to start doing it -- what was the other part of your question?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the leaders here express a desire for the U.S. to do things more aggressively, considering its substantial contribution?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY CHU:\xc2\xa0 I would say most of the feeling I was getting was that the United States has reentered the dialogue on addressing in a serious way climate change and they\'re looking to the United States to exercise leadership in this now.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, we have not been in the past and so it\'s really the recognition that this is a -- decidedly a different and new and a positive direction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Denis, when the President relayed the conversation with Uribe earlier today, did he talk at all about -- Uribe today said that the President said the next time he visits Latin America he\'ll go to Colombia and Uribe said that he\'d be coming to the White House to talk about the Colombian free trade deal.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you could elaborate on that.\xc2\xa0 And also, today Chavez said that he has no doubt that there will be going forward greater closeness between Venezuela and the United States, and I was wondering if the U.S. shares the same view?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. McDONOUGH:\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the conversation with President Uribe, I can confirm that the President did say that on his next trip to Latin America he\'d like to go to Colombia.\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you that he did invite President Uribe to Washington.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have a date for that, but he does look forward to continuing a conversation and the relationship that he has built with President Uribe.</div> <div class="legacy-para">As it relates to the quote that you just read, I only heard it now the first time, I would just mention what I said earlier today when I had the good fortune to be with you all, which is that the President believes that, you know, pictures and smiles and handshakes are important, but not nearly the test that we will need to see whether -- to determine whether this in fact is a new era or a new opportunity for better relations.\xc2\xa0 There will be more significant tests of that in the days and weeks and months ahead, and the President looks forward to following that very closely.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Just on a programming note, I know everybody would be very excited if Dan would now do it in Spanish, but we\'ll forgo that today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In terms of further readouts, the President is attending a dinner tonight but we will read that out tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 And thank you very much for being with us.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  7:35 P.M.
