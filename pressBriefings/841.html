EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, good morning.\xc2\xa0 I think we are getting near the end of our flight, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll move quickly here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to start, but I think Jen has a couple things she wants to preview.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just wanted to go through the convention schedule for you guys, just to remind you of who\xe2\x80\x99s speaking.\xc2\xa0 So tonight, Americans will heard from San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, the keynote speaker, whose story reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s story and the American story -- if you work hard, play by the rules, this is the land of the opportunity, you can get a fair shot and a fair shake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMayor Castro will talk about those values that define us and discuss the choice the American people face in the election between going forward and moving back.\xc2\xa0 We can invest in things like education that was key to his success and critical to a strong middle class and growing economy, or we can provide additional tax cuts to millionaires and pay for it with tax increases on middle-class families while cutting education.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe night culminates with the First Lady, Michelle Obama, who knows the President best, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll speak about the values and experience that drive him.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll give a personal and passionate speech.\xc2\xa0 After a moving introduction from Elaine Brye, a military mom from Ohio, she\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s deep connection to the struggles middle-class families are facing, because he\xe2\x80\x99s lived it, and why he\xe2\x80\x99s made the choices he\xe2\x80\x99s made to strengthen the middle class and move our nation forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m just going to run quickly through the other speakers:\xc2\xa0 Governor Lincoln Chafee, Governor Pat Quinn, Governor Ted Strickland, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Governor Deval Patrick and Tammy Duckworth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about President Clinton tomorrow night?\xc2\xa0 Has the campaign seen his remarks?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of what points he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hitting?\xc2\xa0 And also, is there the risk that in talking about the economic boom of the \xe2\x80\x9890s, that a broader audience now will be drawing comparisons to the current economic situation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 So President Clinton is -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in close contact with him, and he is working on his remarks.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, when he\xe2\x80\x99s done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see them.\xc2\xa0 We have absolute confidence about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say.\xc2\xa0 And we think who better to deliver a message to the American people about the choice middle-class families in this country are facing, the difference between what the vision President Obama is presenting to the American people and the vision Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are presenting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is somebody who can speak directly from experience, not only from his time as President in the \xe2\x80\x9890s, but also as somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s been deeply involved in the last decades, post-presidency, about what we need to do to move the country forward, what the right choices are for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to all of that tomorrow evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President speaks on Thursday ahead of the Friday jobs report.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that an uptick in the unemployment report might diminish any positive impact that might be seen coming out of the convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t know what the jobs numbers are until Friday morning, as you know.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve to date had 29 straight months of private sector job growth, 500,000 manufacturing jobs.\xc2\xa0 We know that more needs to be done, but we feel good about the steps that -- the direction the country is moving in.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegardless of what the numbers are on Friday, we know that the American people are still facing a choice about who they would rather have standing up for them in the White House -- who has a better chance for the middle class, who has a better vision for the country moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And when people are sitting at home, talking about this at their kitchen tables, they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about who\xe2\x80\x99s going to help them send their kids to college, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to help them make sure that they have access to affordable health care, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to make sure that their middle-class tax cuts are continued.\xc2\xa0 And on that, along those lines, we feel pretty good about the choice we\xe2\x80\x99re presenting.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about that on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, a few of the Republicans are seizing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s comment that his work on the economy is incomplete -- that\xe2\x80\x99s how he graded himself.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what he meant by that and also how that squares with you guys also saying that people are better off than they were four years ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- the question he was asked, and I was there for the interview, was what grade he would give himself.\xc2\xa0 And they clearly haven\xe2\x80\x99t done their homework because he\xe2\x80\x99s said that countless times -- in part because we know, despite the fact that millions of people have access to affordable health care, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had 29 straight months of private sector job growth, that the troops have been taken out of Iraq -- we know -- he feels that there\xe2\x80\x99s more we need to do for the American people and for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe alternative is to go with the failed policies, the bad study habits, the rotten ideas of the Romney/Ryan team that no doubt would lead to failing grades.\xc2\xa0 And the President knows more work is -- there is more work that needs to be done, and he wants the American people to send him back for four more years so he can continue to fight for the middle class and continue to do more to make their lives better.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as a recipient of many \xe2\x80\x9cincompletes\xe2\x80\x9d myself, I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a passing grade.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So how do you make your pitch to the American public that an incomplete deserves a reelection?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what an incomplete means is that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that he wants to do for the middle class and for the American people.\xc2\xa0 The alternative is to go back to the old playbook of failed policies and failing grades, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to do.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where they want to lead this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you have a choice: Either you have somebody who has accomplished a great deal, who has helped bring the economy back from the brink of collapse and still wants to fight more for the middle class and do more for the American people, or you have the Romney/Ryan team that wants to go back to the failed, rotten policies of the past.\xc2\xa0 So I think an incomplete and a desire to do more is far better than a failing grade.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One thing that I would interject as a matter of policy is that the other reason that an incomplete is an appropriate assessment of where we stand is there are a number of things sitting on the steps of the Republican-led House of Representatives that could be done that would strengthen our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Senate has passed a piece of legislation that would ensure that taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up on 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses.\xc2\xa0 That would be something that would improve our economy.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are several components to the American -- of the President\xe2\x80\x99s American Jobs Act that would put construction workers and teachers and police officers and firefighters back to work.\xc2\xa0 Outside analysts indicate that that could actually add about a million jobs to our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the work is incomplete, but a lot more could be done if Republicans in Congress -- the reason those things haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten done is because Republicans in Congress are insisting that we actually protect the tax benefits that are currently enjoyed by millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s stopping a number of policy initiatives that could have a tangible, positive impact on the economy.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the Republicans drop their opposition to these measures that would actually have a positive benefit for the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys have said that the President is going to watch the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s speech tonight at the White House and you\xe2\x80\x99ll send a picture out.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about where he\xe2\x80\x99ll watch President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech, and give other details about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is on Wednesday, in Charlotte, and Thursday before he speaks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re arriving, as you know, at 2:45 tomorrow afternoon.\xc2\xa0 At some point in the evening, he\xe2\x80\x99ll do a walkthrough, as is pretty standard.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on where he\xe2\x80\x99ll watch President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech, but we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to get back to you as soon as we have more specifics on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What else will he be doing?\xc2\xa0 Will he be meeting with other Democrats and things there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other updates on his schedule for tomorrow, but if there are more details to share we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly make sure you have them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything concerns about the weather forecast right now with the stadium?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the convention proceedings at Bank of America Stadium will take place rain or shine, similar to other events at the stadium.\xc2\xa0 Of course, there are many sports teams that I hear do some business there.\xc2\xa0 We have an advisory team in place, and if any changes need to be made that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something we would adjust.\xc2\xa0 But at this point in time we don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that and we expect they will proceed as planned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have more trouble filling the stadium if there is rain?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the last couple of weeks reaching out to the people of North Carolina and had an overwhelming response to a desire to come see the President deliver his remarks on Thursday evening.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely confident we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have an energetic crowd, full crowd in the stadium Thursday evening.\xc2\xa0 If changes need to be made because of weather, that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with at that point in time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask -- the Navy SEAL\xe2\x80\x99s book comes out today, hits shelves, on the bin Laden raid.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any comment on what folks can read from that?\xc2\xa0 Or does the White House have any response to what may be right from that book?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do want to remind you of something that the President said on the night that Osama bin Laden was brought to justice last summer, which is the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Bringing Osama bin Laden to justice is a testament to the courage and service of our men and women in uniform, and particularly the special operators who performed so courageously that evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the specifics that are included in the book, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense who have been -- who have taken some questions on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it was appropriate for this former SEAL to write the book?\xc2\xa0 And does he support the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s threat to perhaps proceed from a prosecution standpoint?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, this is something that the Department of Defense is handling, and this is something they\xe2\x80\x99re doing independent of any advice or consultation with the White House or the President.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this is pretty clear, which is that the successful mission really was a testament to the courage and service of our men and women in uniform.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that these events take place rain or shine, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t you concerned about safety if he tries to give the speech and it is bad weather in the stadium?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have an advisory team who is closely watching the weather working with our team, and if any changes need to be made, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other day Vice President Biden made a comment about a reference in a Rolling Stone article and Mitt Romney securing what he called a bailout from the FDIC for Bain Capital while he was working there.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post, David\xe2\x80\x99s fine organization here, has fact-checked that statement and given it three Pinocchios for saying that there was no -- the FDIC, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t receive taxpayer money, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really give a taxpayer bailout for anything like that.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing more about on the stump?\xc2\xa0 And do you think the Vice President will change his language at all on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I spend time with the President, obviously listening to what the President has to say.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the comment you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something the President talks about out there on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 He does talk about the contrast between his vision for the economy and his vision for the future for the American people and how that differs from Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it has become a major part of any stump or that -- and it certainly -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I expect it would be since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even heard of the comment before you just mentioned it now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the comment either, but I do think that there is a pretty clear difference between the approaches that the two candidates are advocating on this front.\xc2\xa0 The President has advocated for Wall Street reform that would ensure that taxpayer-funded bailouts aren\xe2\x80\x99t needed in the future.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan say that they would undo if they were to take office.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo since we\xe2\x80\x99re landing, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we call it a day.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:34 A.M.
