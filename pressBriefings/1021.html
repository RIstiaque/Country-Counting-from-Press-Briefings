(Local)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So this is on background, senior administration officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can I just start by I think clearing up something that\'s very important to understand because I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some misunderstanding, and that\'s reflected in some of the early stories we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen?\xc2\xa0 There is no discussion, no plan, no thought of U.S. troops returning to Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The discussion today regarding U.S. training in Iraq is something entirely different, and let me explain what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s already agreed that as we do in embassies around the world, we will have and we, indeed, already have what\xe2\x80\x99s called an Office of Security Cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And its purpose is to help Iraqis acquire and then learn how to use military equipment that they buy from the United States.\xc2\xa0 And in Iraq that office will have -- and these people are under the authority of the ambassador -- but it will include about 157 people assigned to the embassy, some of whom are military.\xc2\xa0 And then it will also include people who come in on an individual contract for two or three months at a time to again help the Iraqis train on the equipment they bought, and then they leave.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is what we do in embassies around the world in countries where we have a military sales relationship, and that\'s already established and is up and running.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about going forward as possibilities of training beyond the Office of Security Cooperation includes things like the possibility of doing ongoing training of Iraqis outside of Iraq in other countries, integrating Iraqis into regional exercises, possibly rotational training where people could come in for a short period of time, but even that is unlikely.\xc2\xa0 None of this involves the deployment of U.S. forces to Iraq to be stationed here.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to make sure that that\'s clear because it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s some confusion about that based on some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just say a few things at the top and then open it to questions on anything.\xc2\xa0 I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today and what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see tomorrow really is a pivotal moment.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s visit marks I think an important moment in both the life of the United States and our relationship with Iraq.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the end of nearly a decade of war and the start of a new relationship with a sovereign Iraq. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to sort of put this in perspective, more than a million American soldiers have come to Iraq since 2003.\xc2\xa0 A quarter of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s population was born after 2003 and has only experienced in their short lives this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, the country of Iraq has defined itself for more than 50 years basically in opposition to the West.\xc2\xa0 And today what you witnessed with the meeting of the Higher Coordination Committee of the Strategic Framework Agreement is an Iraq that\'s seeking to build with the United States a comprehensive new relationship based on trade, education, culture, science, security and many other things, so this is really -- as the Vice President said repeatedly -- a promise kept, a promise fulfilled.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and Vice President came to office committed to ending the war in Iraq responsibly, and that\'s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re marking now with the end of the military mission in Iraq and the start of this new relationship.\xc2\xa0 And again, today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting I think marked that transition very well and as you heard already lots has been achieved in these different areas, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a very significant agenda going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President today also held meetings with Prime Minister Maliki, President Talabani, Speaker Nujafi.\xc2\xa0 They covered a broad array of issues in these meetings, including this transition to a civilian lead in Iraq for the United States, the security relationship going forward.\xc2\xa0 They talked about the resolution of some of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s remaining international issues; its Chapter Seven obligations, including its relationship with Kuwait.\xc2\xa0 They talked about regional issues including Syria, Turkey, for example.\xc2\xa0 They talked about internal security, especially the need to keep the pressure on violent extremist groups, and they talked about outstanding political issues in Iraq including Arab-Kurd relations, hydrocarbons, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 And of course, they discussed the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming visit to Washington where he will see President Obama.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of this is very powerful evidence that the United States is not disengaging from Iraq, rather the nature of our engagement is changing from what has been a military lead to a civilian lead.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve moved, as the Vice President put it, from the security agreement that governed our military operations in Iraq to the strategic framework agreement, which is the basis for this comprehensive new relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me end it there and invite any questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what they discussed on Syria and Turkey?\xc2\xa0 Given what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria at the moment, a source a great concern for the Iraqis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is a source of concern and it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable because -- and I don\'t want to over-characterize the Iraq position.\xc2\xa0 You should really get that from them, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been clear from comments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the past that they are concerned about the situation in Syria and sectarian conflict that spills over to Iraq and causes or helps spark that kind of tension here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One, we don\'t see any signs of that actually happening in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But two, to the extent that\'s a concern what the Vice President said is the source of instability in Syria right now is President Asad.\xc2\xa0 And if he is allowed to continue killing his own people then there is a danger that what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria does turn into sectarian conflict, exactly what the Iraqis fear.\xc2\xa0 And so the answer to this is to see that President Asad follows through on the calls of his own people and the international people to leave office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if Asad stepped down, do you think the tensions and the factional splits that are coming to the surface now are going to just die down?\xc2\xa0 I mean the cat\xe2\x80\x99s kind of out of the bag there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Look, you can\'t know -- no one can know for sure what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is that what is causing these tensions to come to the surface now is the fact that there is a government in place in Syria that is killing its own people on a daily basis, and that has to stop.\xc2\xa0 That we know.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that you can\'t predict.\xc2\xa0 All you can do is know what the basis of the situation now is a government that\'s killing and repressing its own people.\xc2\xa0 That is the cause of instability in Syria.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can -- go back to the troops for a second.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Maliki said no doubt there is a role for U.S. troops in providing training for Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 As far as you can read into what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying is that the limited definition that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?\xc2\xa0 Or did that strike you as a more broad interpretation of what might be possible --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the limited definition of what I talked about earlier.\xc2\xa0 Again there is no discussion, no contemplation, no thought of returning U.S. troops to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But it was exactly the opposite.\xc2\xa0 What the Vice President said repeatedly, what we have said repeatedly is that we\xe2\x80\x99re making good on the commitment to remove our troops from Iraq by the end of this year as we promised to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so when the -- when the Prime Minister talks about a training relationship, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about these limited functions that I talked about earlier, that is the training that\'s already been agreed to as part of the Office of Security Cooperation to help Iraqis acquire and learn how to use American weapons systems and the possibility -- none of which is agreed -- but the kinds of things we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing about ongoing training outside of Iraq, integration into regional exercises, technical assistance and expert level assistance on things like counterterrorism intelligence which can be done by people who are assigned to the embassy working with Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 But nothing about redeploying U.S. forces to be stationed here to train Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 That is not part at all of any discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent did Iran come up today?\xc2\xa0 And can you give me a sense for what message the Vice President may have brought relative to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s role and whether Maliki said something -- anything to you about the role he saw Iran playing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Iran was discussed in -- I think it came up in most of the meetings.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President made clear something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear repeatedly which is, one, we fully expect Iraq to have a relationship with Iran.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a long border and a long history.\xc2\xa0 And that is fully understood.\xc2\xa0 But what is not acceptable and not understood would be to in any way allow Iran to use our presence in Iraq as a target. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve committed in the past not to use Iraq as any kind of staging ground to act against other countries.\xc2\xa0 That would include Iran.\xc2\xa0 Reciprocally, it is fully our expectation that the government of Iraq not allow Iraq to be used as an area to target U.S. personal.\xc2\xa0 And so we were very gratified this summer when -- after there had been an uptick in militia attacks against U.S. personnel that Prime Minister Maliki had his forces go on the offensive in Maysan.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also the Iraqis told Tehran that they had to stop their support for extremist militias and that Iraq considered an attack on Americans in Iraq to be an attack on Iraq and its own sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since a significant decrease in these actions.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s something that needs to be sustained going forward, and so there was discussion of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they talk about air support for Iraq --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Air support in what sense?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like Iraq would have (inaudible) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Oh, well, one -- yes, one of the things they talked about was the fact that Iraq is buying American F-16s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it will take time, but we will have again as part of the Office of Security Cooperation, American experts here to help Iraq acquire those planes an train on them.\xc2\xa0 Before that -- this was not discussed, but there may be things that can be done before that regionally and outside of Iraq to build up Iraqi capacity in the air, but there was no discussion of that today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the short-term how can Iraqi air space be defended -- lack of fighter aircrafts, surface-to-air missiles, et cetera?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, in the first instance, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all clear to me where any threat -- external threat to Iraq is coming from.\xc2\xa0 The security challenges in Iraq now are internal, and it\xe2\x80\x99s our assessment that Iraqi security forces are very much capable of dealing with those threats.\xc2\xa0 We have -- as the Vice President said today, we have spent many years and many resources helping Iraq build up its capacity of its security forces -- army, police and others and special forces.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated significant effectiveness.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that while tragically Iraq continues to be plagued by violent incidents and extremist attacks, overall what is striking is that those incidents are at an historic low and have remained so for almost two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 2007, 2008 at the height of insecurity in Iraq, there were about 1,600 violent incidents every week.\xc2\xa0 Now there are fewer than 100 violent incidents a week, and so you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a more than tenfold decrease in violent incidents.\xc2\xa0 And again, this has been constant over the last couple of years.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s I think for two -- primarily for two reasons:\xc2\xa0 one, because of the capabilities and capacities of the Iraqi security forces, but two, because politics has emerged as the basic way of doing business in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 All of the major stakeholders are finding that they can protect their interests and advance their interests through the political process, and so that\'s extremely encouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned hydrocarbons.\xc2\xa0 Did the Exxon contract with the Kurdish regional government get discussed?\xc2\xa0 And what can you tell us about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask my colleague.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t recall that being discussed.\xc2\xa0 Hydrocarbons were discussed, and we heard from the Iraqis today some confidence that the long-awaited hydrocarbons law would actually come up and be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many years has that been?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, 2007 I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 What we heard today from a couple people was that it would come up to the Council of Representatives before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Now hope springs eternal.\xc2\xa0 This has been going on for a while, but there was some optimism expressed about the prospects of actually getting that done, and that would be a very significant step forward because what you see when you look at both the reality and the potential for oil production in this country is extraordinary but not yet realized.\xc2\xa0 A tremendous amount of investment has already been made, but a much greater amount of investment still needs to be made if Iraq is to realize its potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that investment while some of it\xe2\x80\x99s happening is itself not going to be fully realized until there is certainty about the legal aspects of hydrocarbons.\xc2\xa0 And if this law gets done and creates that kind of certainty, it creates a much greater prospect for the kind of investment that\'s needed to help Iraq realize its production capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 My colleague is right in terms of the necessity of the hydrocarbons law to really unlock this full potential.\xc2\xa0 In the interim, over the last year, oil production has increased because some of the contracts that have been signed related to existing oil fields to improve their output, so it has gone up by about 500,000 barrels a day in the past year, and it\xe2\x80\x99s anticipated to increase by another 500,000 over the next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So while this doesn\'t fully realize what Iraq is capable of here, it does show that some demonstrable progress has been made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on this?\xc2\xa0 Exxon -- I mean the Exxon issue got a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 The central government actually threatened Exxon with sanctions, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been asked about and talked about in a number of different venues.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just interested why you don\'t think it came up.\xc2\xa0 I mean you obviously chose not to raise it, but then they chose not to raise it either.\xc2\xa0 Is it because there was a desire not to get involved in what is a business negotiation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You have to ask the Iraqis about that.\xc2\xa0 From our perspective, this is a private transaction.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not in the business of telling companies what to do and what not to do.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, when they ask us or consult with us, we lay out for them how we see the situation in a particular country, what the obstacles or concerns might be, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not in the business of telling them what to do.\xc2\xa0 They have to make their own decisions and their own judgments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again as to the Iraqi perspective, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned violence is down compared to the peak in \xe2\x80\x9906, \xe2\x80\x9907, but in the past six, seven, eight days, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a number of fairly major attacks:\xc2\xa0 19 dead in Basra; at least 13, 14 in Taji, bombings in Abu Ghraib, Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly high tempo of significant attacks in recent days.\xc2\xa0 What is your assessment of this? And is this kind of a last challenge to the U.S. here?\xc2\xa0 Or how do you assess it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past is particularly al Qaeda in Iraq is unfortunately able to conduct occasional spectacular attacks.\xc2\xa0 And typically it takes it some weeks or even months between attacks to essentially rearm and be able to conduct another, so I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last few days reflects another spasm from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, for sure there are groups that are -- that would like to create the impression through violent attacks now, create the narrative that they\'re responsible for chasing us out Iraq or forcing us to leave, which, of course, is fundamentally wrong.\xc2\xa0 But that is probably an objective.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, what\xe2\x80\x99s important to emphasize here is that these attacks are tragic.\xc2\xa0 They\'re terrible.\xc2\xa0 They take innocent Iraqi lives, which is why they\'re in such total revulsion in Iraq in all communities against the violent extremists.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the larger context, the trends remain as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been for the last two years which is violent incidents remain at historic lows, and we don\'t see that changing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any plans for the Iraqi (inaudible) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have several programs that would allow Iraqis to seek to immigrate to the United States, including programs for those who have worked directly with us.\xc2\xa0 And so there are avenues for that.\xc2\xa0 We are constantly looking at those programs to make sure that they are as effective as they can be.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to people who put their lives on the line in very difficult moments to work with us and work for a better Iraq, so it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly looking at and thinking about and making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the best job that we can in meeting any demand that exists.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s taking a long time --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, these things --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) asking about myself.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And these programs across the board unfortunately when it comes to immigration take time.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly looking to see if we can improve and move things more quickly.\xc2\xa0 But these are -- as you know apparently from personal experience -- complicated matters, and we keep working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to Turkey.\xc2\xa0 The Turks talked about creating a buffer zone potentially in northern Syria.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view on the advisability of something like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that, and I also don\'t want to get into non-Iraq-related subjects for now.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d leave that to Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ask a kind of a processy question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President talked about that there was going to be a sort of a joint defense and security coordinating committee under auspices of the higher committee.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t that already exist?\xc2\xa0 Or was it handled differently?\xc2\xa0 And what significance does it have that a separate subcommittee is being organized?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think to understand this committee it\xe2\x80\x99s going to start up operations early next year as we transition into this new civilian phase.\xc2\xa0 And this committee, just like all the others, is going to fall within this structure.\xc2\xa0 And it will have civilian leadership.\xc2\xa0 It will be led by State and Defense Department civilians, and so very much underscoring that the security and defense relationship will be much like it is managed with other countries with which we have normal relations and robust security and defense partnerships.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so beforehand, you could say that those aspects were governed under the security agreement.\xc2\xa0 With the expiration of the security agreement, as we go toward a more normal relationship, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to come under the strategic framework agreement with this defense and security commission.\xc2\xa0 Does that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think it was deceptive today the way they announced it that it was something that they have launched when it was part of the process all along and just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- is now coming into fruition because of circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But with SOFA expiring you need to have some kind of a formal structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Because the strategic framework agreement always included a security relationship.\xc2\xa0 That was part of the understanding of what a comprehensive relationship would be between the United States and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But as my colleague just said, up until -- or until December 31st that security aspect was governed by the security agreement, separate from the strategic framework agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the things -- just to follow up something you said at the top, which was Arab-Kurd relations were raised.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been this concern about secession.\xc2\xa0 What was sort of said on that in private discussions today that you can share?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Again, don\'t want to characterize what the Iraqis said.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President in his meetings and in the many conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s had over the months with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders has continued to talk about the importance of resolving the outstanding issues in that relationship:\xc2\xa0 the disputed -- boundaries; the status of Kirkuk; hydrocarbons also fits into an Arab-Kurd relationship; the integration of the Pesh Merga into the Iraqi security forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by the way on the latter, there\xe2\x80\x99s been -- there was some significant progress in that the central government has now agreed to put a significantly greater number of Pesh Merga on the security payroll, so that\'s encouraging.\xc2\xa0 But this is just something that is a regular part of the conversation asking -- basically asking the Iraqis for their assessment of progress, outstanding issues and how they want to be handling these.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I should add that we\xe2\x80\x99ve also had discussion and the Vice President talked to the head of the United Nations mission here.\xc2\xa0 And one of the U.N.\xe2\x80\x99s functions here is to help deal with those issues, so that was also part of the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean Salahuddin recently declared some degree of autonomy, which is potentially a flashpoint.\xc2\xa0 Was that discussed in terms of a trigger? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, but the Iraqi constitution provides mechanisms for the various governments to form regions if they choose.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole process for that.\xc2\xa0 So there are -- discussions about that come up from time to time as they have recently.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s an internal Iraqi matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to be it, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 7:55 P.M.
