EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I have no special announcements or statements, so I will begin by calling on Mr. Feller.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on Syria, and then I wanted to ask you about the Afghanistan meeting.\xc2\xa0 In Syria, the Assad regime, as you know, continues to assault its own people.\xc2\xa0 Protesters there continue to die by the day.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could articulate from the White House perspective why Syria is different than Libya and why have we not heard President Obama say, for example, that Assad has lost the confidence of his people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question, Ben.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you did see the President\xe2\x80\x99s very strong statement of Friday where he condemned in the strongest possible terms the use of force by the Syrian government against demonstrators; referred to an outrageous use of violence to quell protests.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned how this administration for two months has been repeatedly encouraging President Assad and the Syrian government to implement meaningful reforms, and yet they have refused to respect the rights of the Syrian people or be responsive to their aspirations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people have called for the freedoms that all individuals around the world should enjoy -- freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and the ability to freely choose their leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said, and I say here, that we strongly oppose the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of its citizens, and we continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, to your question about the differences, of which there are many, I would simply say that Libya was, again, a unique situation.\xc2\xa0 We had large portions of the country that were out of the control of Muammar Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 We had a Qaddafi regime that was moving against its own people in a coordinated military fashion and was about to assault a very large city on the promise that it would show -- \xe2\x80\x9cit,\xe2\x80\x9d the regime -- would show that city and its residence \xe2\x80\x9cno mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We had an international consensus to act.\xc2\xa0 We had the support of the Arab League to act in a multilateral fashion.\xc2\xa0 And we supported that move to save the lives of the people of Misurata and elsewhere in Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Libya was a unique situation.\xc2\xa0 However, we continue to look for ways and are pursuing a range of possible policy options, including targeted sanctions, to respond to the crackdown in Syria and to make clear that this behavior is unacceptable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you know obviously that Syria already is under some significant sanctions by the United States, but we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at other means to increase the pressure on the regime and the Syrian government in a targeted way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Assad still does have the confidence of his people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s up for -- it is up, as it is for all of these countries, it is up to the people of Syria to decide who its leaders should be.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe.\xc2\xa0 And the Syrian people should certainly be respected, their rights should be respected.\xc2\xa0 They should not be attacked; they should not be killed as they express their grievances to the Syrian government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, our position in all these countries has been that it is up to the people of those countries to decide who their leaders are, and we call for processes of reform that allow that to take place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned sanctions would be targeted.\xc2\xa0 Can you offer any sense of what that means and how they could potentially help stop the killing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics for you because we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing a variety of options, or looking at, rather, a range of options, including targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen is that sanctions can put pressure on governments and regimes to change their behavior, and I think that would be obviously the goal of this.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to encourage President Assad and his government to honor the promises that President Assad has made to lift the emergency law, for example; to institute reforms; and obviously to cease the violence against his own people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And -- thanks.\xc2\xa0 On the AfPak meeting, can you describe whether -- I know this is a monthly meeting, but obviously some big decisions coming up -- can you describe whether this is in any way a decisional meeting for the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is not a decisional meeting.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- one of the regular, as you mentioned, monthly meetings, run by the President on Afghanistan and Pakistan with the usual principals involved in that meeting, but it is not decisional.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, one on Syria, and then on an economic subject -- would the sanctions that you mentioned, that are being contemplated against the Syrian government, would that be -- would those target individuals and perhaps even Assad himself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about -- beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, which is to say that we are pursuing a range of possible options, including targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I should note for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have had a fairly aggressive regime of sanctions in place, unilateral sanctions, since I believe 2003 -- and this would be in addition to that, if we were to pursue that course of action.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly looking at different ways to make clear to the Syrian government how appalling we find this behavior to be, and to encourage them both, as we have, by speaking out against it, but another means to stop the violence and to move towards serious reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But sanctions against individuals -- individual leaders, individual --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, targeted -- you can parse that -- but targeted sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the oil industry is something that has escaped sanctions before from the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Would there be any look at targeting Syria\xe2\x80\x99s crude oil business?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at targeted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And the other question is actually about the dollar.\xc2\xa0 The administration\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is the administration concerned about the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s really been a growing weakness of the dollar on world markets, and does it remain committed to the strong dollar policy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will leave a comment on the dollar to my colleague at the Treasury Department, Secretary Geithner, if I may.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you seen any evidence that having an ambassador in Syria has had any positive effect whatsoever?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Having an ambassador in Syria has allowed us to be in Syria, basically in the presence of the government, to make our views known directly and not via long distance.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, it has been useful to have our ambassador there, precisely because we can communicate directly what our positions and views are.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that has been a useful avenue for us to pursue in terms of communicating our points of view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not in terms of influencing behavior, I suppose?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we condemn the behavior we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, so clearly we are not pleased by or do not support what we have seen the Syrian government do to its own citizens.\xc2\xa0 But as a means of communicating directly our points of view, I think it is useful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First-quarter GDP growth numbers are expected this week and they\xe2\x80\x99re not expected to be encouraging; they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be worse than last quarter.\xc2\xa0 So much of this recovery, as the President has said, is psychological.\xc2\xa0 So much about the American people being prepared or allowing the economy to grow has been based on feelings about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re headed in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 The President has said that.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the White House and the Treasury Department and the administration in general has prepared the country sufficiently for what look to be disappointing GDP numbers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Americans judge how they feel personally about their economic circumstances based on a report on GDP.\xc2\xa0 The fact that Americans still feel stress is true today, it was true a month ago, and it will be true a month from now because we are still climbing our way out of a very deep hole.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is still far too much joblessness.\xc2\xa0 We have worked very hard in this administration to attack that problem, to bring down unemployment.\xc2\xa0 Remember in that terrible recession -- the worst since the Great Depression -- this country lost 8 million jobs before this administration had a chance for its economic policies even to go to work.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a deep hole.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have been growing for a number of quarters.\xc2\xa0 We have been creating jobs for more than a year, private sector jobs -- quite a few, in fact.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not out of the hole.\xc2\xa0 And I think we speak about that quite frankly all the time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re -- in the budget negotiations for the fiscal year 2011, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President\xe2\x80\x99s starting position was that we should do nothing that harms the recovery; we should do nothing that arrests the growth or the job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is his approach as he looks forward to our negotiations on long-term deficit reduction and fiscal reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all with a purpose.\xc2\xa0 Grow the economy, increase job creation, because he knows very -- in his -- as he wakes up every morning and goes to sleep every night, this is what he thinks about.\xc2\xa0 He knows that there are Americans out there who are still struggling, still suffering -- too many.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I would say in terms of preparing the American people, we are very clear and blunt about what we see out there, what needs to be done, why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important not to take any actions that arrest the recovery, to do everything we can to speed it up, increase growth, increase job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anybody from this podium or the President talk about how things are actually now sliding back a little bit in terms of GDP growth.\xc2\xa0 I mean --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about GDP growth.\xc2\xa0 The President and his various spokesmen speak all the time about the fact that unemployment is still too high; the fact that we are still climbing out of this very deep hole; that fact that we need to do everything we can to continue to grow the economy and increase job creation; and that, concurrently -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him speak about quite a bit about lately because it\xe2\x80\x99s on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 minds and it\xe2\x80\x99s a real issue -- the fact that rising gas prices have hurt Americans in their wallets and pocketbooks and have hurt their economic bottom lines.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he understands that that creates economic insecurity, combined with all these other factors.\xc2\xa0 So he speaks frequently about it -- in fact, I think at all three of his town halls last week he did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Syria has significant economic interest in Europe compared to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to European allies to see what maybe they will do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we speak with our allies all the time about the situation in the region, in other countries as well as Syria.\xc2\xa0 But I have no specific announcement to make about discussions with our allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is it for European allies to take a similar track here as the U.S. considers sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to dictate to other countries from here what they should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that we are very concerned about it, as I think many others countries are, and we are looking at a variety of options, a range of options, including targeted sanctions, more targeted sanctions aimed at the Syrian government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about international sanctions and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s desire --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the things -- I mean, you have to -- when the United Nations acts or other bodies act, it\xe2\x80\x99s a collective group action.\xc2\xa0 Right now what we can do in a relatively short period of time is express our views very clearly and review possible unilateral actions we can take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the disclosure of new material from WikiLeaks and other apparently -- as well as other sources about the situation following 9/11 when a lot of information was assembled about various actors, were there lessons learned from that, in terms of what we might have been able to do with the information that we had but didn\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish, as in tracking down Obama bin Laden?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to comment on the release of the documents?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to comment on what we might have done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the release of classified information we condemn in the strongest possible terms.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that The New York Times and other news organizations have made the decision to publish numerous documents obtained illegally concerning the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issue in terms of the content of that material, obviously we had been aware of the detainee assessment briefs.\xc2\xa0 The publication of them has not made them -- does not make them new to us.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure in terms of the question about the substance of the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it make them -- the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s now out there, does it offer an opportunity for reflection on what we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is what the President is committed to, which is working towards the ultimate closure of the detention facility, consistent with the good security practices and values that we have a nation; consistent with the previous President, George W. Bush, John McCain when he was a candidate, uniformed military leadership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talking more about the intelligence developed on various --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on the specific intelligence.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the assessment briefs were compiled by the Department of Defense between 2002 and early 2009, and obviously the President in early 2009 created his Guantanamo review task force, which took into account those assessment briefs but also other sources of information.\xc2\xa0 And you should not assume that the conclusions of that task force were the same as the conclusions in those briefs about individual detainees.\xc2\xa0 I just think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important point to make, because these are not -- a detainee assessment brief in 2006 may or may not be reflective of the administration or the government\xe2\x80\x99s view of that particular detainee in 2011.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Syria, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the impression from your comments that the ongoing activity of the Syrian government in repressing its people have speeded up this decision process on possible new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Has it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard me say from here before, or others, that we are considering a range of options, including targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I think that we are very concerned by the actions --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say you\xe2\x80\x99re considering them.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that there are likely to be new sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make an announcement.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing options, and obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that in light of the actions that have been taken by the Syrian government against its people.\xc2\xa0 So -- and I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s very frank and strong statement on Friday speaks to how we view the behavior of the Syrian government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I count Syria as the only country on the list of state sponsors of terrorism with whom we have diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?\xc2\xa0 Or conversely, why do we not have diplomatic relations with Sudan, North Korea and Cuba?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, I would just go back to the point that we believe that sending an ambassador and having diplomatic relations with Syria was a useful and it remains a useful course to take because it allows us to communicate directly with the Syrian government, including to voice very clearly our strenuous objections to the behavior that it\xe2\x80\x99s perpetrating in recent days.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of decisions about diplomatic engagement and non-engagement, I can take that question.\xc2\xa0 I can also send you to the State Department in terms of other states.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there was a decision made in this case that having an ambassador there was a useful thing to have and has been useful in communicating directly precisely because we can speak very clearly in this case regarding our opposition and concern about the behavior of the government against its people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some idea of the amount of communication?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine you can tell us about the communication itself, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you -- in terms of communications between the ambassador and the embassy and the government, I would refer you to the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman suggested aid to the opposition in Syria -- communications equipment, something like that.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that would be considered along with these sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, I would simply say that the -- as far as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to tell and others, I think more importantly others here, there is not an organized opposition to whom we would give aid at this point.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to be clear about where we are in this process, which is we have sanctions that have been in place.\xc2\xa0 We are considering a variety -- a range of options, including targeted sanctions, and the President has issued a very strong condemnation of the violence that the government has used.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few minutes ago you talked about how the unemployment rate is still too high, the administration wants to do everything it can to help spur job creation.\xc2\xa0 But at this point what more can the administration do to accelerate hiring among companies?\xc2\xa0 Beyond hoping or waiting or urging companies to do more hiring, is there anything you guys are looking at legislatively or credits or something that could be done to give another boost?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal, as well as his fiscal reform framework that he put forward, includes within both cases the kind of investments, continued investments we need in clean energy, for example, which is so vital to the long-term economic future of this country in two different ways:\xc2\xa0 one, to create the industries that are -- industries of the future that are in this country, and therefore jobs in this country; and two, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, an issue that is of high priority right now as we all deal with the high prices at the pump.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And within the context of that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to point out that in both the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 budget proposal and in his fiscal reform plan, he calls for the elimination of subsidies to oil and gas companies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major oil and gas companies are going to report this week significant, if not record profits.\xc2\xa0 Given the constraints that we are under, given the need to tighten our belts, given the need to reduce the deficit, this President feels very strongly that it is inappropriate to continue those subsidies.\xc2\xa0 And when Americans are going every day of the week to their local gas stations and filling up and seeing a tank of gas cost $60, $70, $80 or more, I think they would be appalled to learn that major oil companies -- oil and gas companies will be announcing record profits this week, in the tens of billions of dollars in some cases -- certainly collectively.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for American companies to have profit.\xc2\xa0 What is not necessary is for the taxpayers to subsidize companies that are experiencing those kind of record or substantial profits, and especially when we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.\xc2\xa0 We need to use that money elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 We need to use that money for clean energy investment so that we have the industries of the future and we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 The President has made very clear we need to do that by 2025 by a third.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe need to diversify our energy sources, because there is no silver bullet solution to these price hikes that we see in oil prices.\xc2\xa0 So we need to take a comprehensive approach.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things we need to do is end that subsidy, because I think most Americans would agree with the President that it\xe2\x80\x99s simply crazy and unsustainable to continue to subsidize the oil and gas companies when we need to reduce our deficit and invest elsewhere.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So beyond the budget -- which sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lay some groundwork, a foundation, to clean energy jobs and investments to create jobs down the road -- there is nothing more immediate that would be stimulative to the economy -- nothing like -- that could get through Congress, like tax -- any more tax credits or breaks for companies?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s basically the longer-term budget stuff that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at than more immediate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, yes.\xc2\xa0 Basically, there are a lot of long-term proposals out there that are very important to continuing our economic growth.\xc2\xa0 I think most people -- economists would agree that if we could reach a bipartisan solution towards significant deficit reduction that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced and maintains our investments, that allow us to grow and create jobs, that that would have a highly positive impact on the economy and job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would also say that the tax cut deal the President and members of Congress -- leaders of Congress from both parties negotiated in December continues every week in the paychecks Americans receive to provide a stimulative effect, if you will, especially through the payroll tax holiday; putting money in Americans\xe2\x80\x99 pockets that they can then spend, in part to cover the high price of gas, but in other areas to help stimulate the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when the President was in San Francisco --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going over here.\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Syria, you mentioned that you\xe2\x80\x99re considering targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. also working for some sort of U.N action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific.\xc2\xa0 We obviously work with the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 We work with our allies and partners around the world regularly on the -- in unrest in the region and different ways to approach it, and to try to affect outcomes there in a positive way, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific for you on U.N. action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be helpful in this situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on -- I think it always helps to work together with our partners, but we take actions multilaterally, unilaterally all the time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In San Francisco --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get through this and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the trip last week, President Obama did six fundraisers in two days, of which four were print pool only; only two open to radio and TV coverage.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how you decide which of these fundraisers are going to be open to full coverage and which ones --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I believe we have a policy in place that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for a long time in this administration that demonstrates --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem consistent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to discuss with you how we do that.\xc2\xa0 What we do provide is access to these fundraisers in a way that I think is certainly as great as previous Presidents, if not greater, and that we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 But how each one is decided I think is based on the ways that we have approached this in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the meeting with the Attorney General about today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting with a member of the Cabinet the President has periodically.\xc2\xa0 There is no specific agenda item.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Roger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk a little bit about the agenda tomorrow when the President meets with the Crown Prince of the UAE?\xc2\xa0 And will he be making any specific requests of the Crown Prince?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing regional security issues, as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 The UAE has been a very helpful partner with the coalition in dealing with Libya.\xc2\xa0 But I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about broader issues, as well as specifically Libya.\xc2\xa0 But I have no announcement to make about possible announcements, if you will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the AfPak meeting, has Petraeus sent along any recommended number for withdrawal starting in July?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we at that stage yet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I said is we\xe2\x80\x99re not at a point where the President is making a decision specifically on an approach to that transition point.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- this is a discussion that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing, but nothing will be firmly decided today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more -- one, just a clean-up thing.\xc2\xa0 On the updated list of attendees, the Secretary of State wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listed.\xc2\xa0 Is there any significance to that, or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, considering the bombing of the Qaddafi compound over the weekend, Libya is suggesting that this is NATO and the United States trying to assassinate Muammar Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?\xc2\xa0 And going on that assumption, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this beg the question of how far NATO and the U.S. should be going in this effort?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will tell you that it is not the policy of this administration and it is not the policy outlined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 to effect regime change through force.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You should go to NATO to ask NATO about the specific decisions in terms of bombing missions, but the mission -- the goal of the mission is clear:\xc2\xa0 protect the civilian population, enforce the no-fly zone, enforce the arms embargo.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I have frequently in the past gotten questions about why not, why the U.S. military or NATO isn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to effect regime change through force, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because it is not prescribed in the United Nations Security Council 1973, and because this country, this administration does not believe that that is the right course of action to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So these raids on the compound, this is strictly for strategic purposes, or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For the specifics, I would -- on a specific bombing mission, I would refer you to NATO.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly not the policy of the coalition, of this administration, to decapitate, if you will, or to effect regime change in Libya by force.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Jackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, do you -- can you tell us what, if anything, the President is doing this week by way of moving the ball on the budget front since there\xe2\x80\x99s so little time remaining before the debt limit votes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Congress continues its recess, and a number of members are traveling around the world, as well as the country.\xc2\xa0 So meetings are hard to come by, although not impossible.\xc2\xa0 There will be discussions at the staff as well as probably the presidential level.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to the meeting that the Vice President will host -- bicameral and bipartisan meeting -- on May 5th.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that we -- that that meeting begin a process of negotiations towards a bipartisan agreement on areas of consensus where we can actually reduce the deficit in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced and helps the economy rather than hurts it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the number of comments from Republicans that don\xe2\x80\x99t -- simply don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a big negative consequence, let alone default, if the debit limit isn\xe2\x80\x99t raised, does the President plan anything for May and June by way of making the case that this is something you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play around with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s made the case.\xc2\xa0 And I would just say simply that those members of Congress who have suggested that are dead wrong.\xc2\xa0 There are severe potential consequences to not raising the debt ceiling, and that assessment is not just this administration\xe2\x80\x99s assessment; it\xe2\x80\x99s the assessment made clear by leaders of Congress, Republican leaders of Congress in statements they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the past.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an assessment shared by economists, independent economists across the board, both here in America and around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be terrible folly to play games with this.\xc2\xa0 We simply as a nation cannot afford to be thrown back into recession, to have all the work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done, and the American people have worked so hard to climb out of this recession -- to have -- for political purposes to have the United States default on its obligations, send markets around the globe into a tailspin, interest rates dramatically upward would be a truly terrible thing to do.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the President will continue to make that point, the Secretary of Treasury and others.\xc2\xa0 And we will remind you and others that leaders of Congress of both parties have said the same thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We understand the need to reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 The President is very committed to that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we created a fiscal commission when Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote to create one.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has announced this process that the Vice President will lead negotiations, bipartisan, bicameral negotiations toward reducing our deficit, getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 But you simply cannot play games with the full faith and credit of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, on the -- one more on the Afghanistan meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know you said that this is not a decision meeting.\xc2\xa0 But surely the President is at the point where he\xe2\x80\x99s actively soliciting views on troop levels, since he\xe2\x80\x99s got the decision -- I mean, if the actual withdrawal starts as early as July, and presumably there\xe2\x80\x99s lead time for orders and all that, he must be at least getting very close to a decision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at a variety of options about the course forward that he wants to take with regards to that July 2011 transition date.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make about which proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s choosing from, but simply to say that that obligation will be met, that commitment will be met as he made clear when he announced his strategy and his policy and has been reiterated over the months since.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if July is the date, when we are likely to see him actually announce the decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule handy to give you that information, but it will be done in a timely fashion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow on this meeting.\xc2\xa0 Did the President ask for any assurances today that the escape of more than 400 Taliban from an Afghan prison isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect evidence of how the U.S. couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly start withdrawing this summer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered this before.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you never gave an answer, and the President came to the podium and said, we cannot control earthquakes.\xc2\xa0 Does he also mean we cannot predict earthquakes?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for that on you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get an answer for me?\xc2\xa0 It would be very important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Chicago on Wednesday, can you say why or do you know why he chose to do this particular interview that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing with Oprah?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a regular daytime television viewer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s -- she\xe2\x80\x99s -- her show is coming to a conclusion of a terrific run, and I think, as you know, he considers Oprah a friend, and he looks forward to being on the show with the First Lady.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also is there anything else in Chicago on Wednesday?\xc2\xa0 Will there be a town hall or something like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any schedule updates for you.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you can check back later, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll just put something out if we do have a change or an addition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do have a follow-up to that.\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to you, Lynn.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a question on the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 Back in 2008, the President outlined to the LGBT community a litany of objectives he wanted to achieve over the course of his administration.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that as we get closer to November 2012 that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to reissue some sort of list of what he wants to achieve with the LGBT community in the second term of his administration, perhaps making new promises?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate reissuing a list.\xc2\xa0 I think his position on a number of issues has been clear and his accomplishments on a number of issues have been clear.\xc2\xa0 So as is true with a number of the goals he set forward during his campaign and in the first two-plus years of his administration, remains those that are unfinished.\xc2\xa0 As he\xe2\x80\x99s been saying a lot lately we still have a lot of work to do and we\xe2\x80\x99re not done yet.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that he will remain committed to a number of policy objectives that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been achieved yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, just to be clear -- two major promises that he made to the LGBT community back in 2008 remain unfulfilled.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and full legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.\xc2\xa0 Do you still see those happening in the course of the Obama administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a pretty significant action on DOMA.\xc2\xa0 And on the other issues, I think he remains committed to the agenda on a variety of issues that he laid forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to try to clarify on Syria -- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about -- anything about our allies or the Arab League, but the way that this has worked, both in the case of Egypt and in the case of Libya, although they had different outcomes, was that we were certainly talking with our allies, talking with Arab League folks, talking for -- with pro-Democracy folks inside those countries to try to leverage a response, is it safe to assume that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing all the same stuff -- that the U.S. is doing all the same stuff that it\xe2\x80\x99s done in all these previous cases?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that the United States and this administration is doing everything it can, including discussions with allies, with the United Nations, leaders and governments in the region, to make clear its policy position and to make clear to the Syrian government that we believe it needs to cease and desist from the violence it\xe2\x80\x99s been perpetrating against its own citizens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the conventional wisdom would probably say that the hurdle in Syria is much higher because it\xe2\x80\x99s such a Pandora\xe2\x80\x99s box, right?\xc2\xa0 That there are so many implications if there\xe2\x80\x99s any substantive -- really substantive response by the U.S. or the West.\xc2\xa0 Is it the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s position that the U.S., either with its allies or unilaterally, may, in fact, continue to ramp up pressure and act more aggressively sort of despite the conventional wisdom?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the warning to Syria?\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve condemned them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, every country is different.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, as we have, as there has been unrest in a variety of countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 Two, we are looking at a range of options, including -- I mentioned targeted sanctions, but including and not exclusive to targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- by that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hint that there is some larger thing coming.\xc2\xa0 These are -- this is a process in reaction to the appalling violence.\xc2\xa0 These are steps that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking because of it, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement, and going forward we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xc2\xa0 But we are reviewing a range of policy options.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Clare Gillis, the American reporter who was detained in Libya, was allowed to talk to her parents last week but she\xe2\x80\x99s still in a women\xe2\x80\x99s prison in Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on efforts to secure her release?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is -- and what I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to say is we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very concerned.\xc2\xa0 We oppose the detention of journalists, human rights activists and others.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we can to help in this situation.\xc2\xa0 To comment further would be counterproductive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, very little has been said since Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s statement about the President speaking on Middle East and North African policy approaches.\xc2\xa0 Will we be hearing from the President between now or before Prime Minister Netanyahu addresses the Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling update for you on possible remarks the President may give.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has spoken quite a bit about the region, the Arab Spring that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he discuss this on the phone with the Prime Minister when he talked to him recently?\xc2\xa0 You talked about the conversation --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Over -- to wish him and Israel Passover greetings?\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think that was -- but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say no.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I think that was mostly a call to express America\xe2\x80\x99s greetings over Passover.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There were reports last week about a draft executive order to implement parts of the DISCLOSE Act, and Senator McConnell had called this a \xe2\x80\x9ceffort to silence or intimidate political adversaries through the contracting process.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s just incorrect.\xc2\xa0 And first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s fully acknowledged that there is a process underway; a draft is just that.\xc2\xa0 It could change as it makes its way through the process.\xc2\xa0 But what the President is committed to is transparency, and he certainly thinks that the American taxpayer should know where his or her money is going.\xc2\xa0 So I -- this is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his last three appearances, the President appeared to be drawing a line in the sand about project Head Start as something he would not let be touched in the budget process.\xc2\xa0 And I know that many people, including Congressman Joe Walsh, himself a fellow Chicagoan who taught in the inner-city schools, said Head Start has considerable administrative problems.\xc2\xa0 Just last year the President\xe2\x80\x99s own HHS Department and General Accountability Office listed reports showing Head Start not really meeting the mark in its administrative capacity or results, in one case.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of the critical reports of his administration when he defends Head Start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about what you reference, but I know the President remains committed to funding Head Start because he believes it is vital and it is important and that when we\xe2\x80\x99re making budget choices that that\xe2\x80\x99s a choice we have to make to fund that program, especially when we need to look at our government and the ways we fund programs with an eye towards future economic growth and development in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the education programs, including Head Start, are vital in terms of preparing Americans for the future.\xc2\xa0 And if you -- and there is a huge economic impact to not doing that, including the effect on the economy when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have kids who are properly educated and their inability to be highly productive members of society in terms of entering the workforce, and you decrease the opportunity to fill those high-skill jobs that will be the jobs of the future in this country.\xc2\xa0 So Head Start is very much a part of that package as he sees it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the criticisms from the HHS Department and GAO, which are only a year old --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a discussion with him about analysis of this particular program.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that a particular program may not be run perfectly or may have problems with it, that may or may not be true.\xc2\xa0 But the President is committed to Head Start and he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to investments in education, precisely because of the economic imperative we have in this country to make sure our kids are educated and prepared for the 21st century -- because we will not win the future if we do not have the best educated workforce in the world, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s so focused on this even as we tighten our belts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Kara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 You guys traditionally put out statements or proclamations on various religious holidays and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I saw one from the President on Easter yesterday and was just wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason one didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, the President went to the church yesterday; it was well covered.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if we put out a statement or not, but he obviously personally celebrated Easter with his family and went to church to celebrate that.\xc2\xa0 And -- *<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 The highest Christian holiday and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he put out a statement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, come on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re asking these key important questions, guys.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the President took his family to church in a very high-profile way to celebrate Easter.\xc2\xa0 I think it was highly visible to most Americans.\xc2\xa0 And he -- as a devoted Christian, he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important holiday for him personally, for his family and for Christians around the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, David.\xc2\xa0 Last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Another religious question.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Franklin Graham said that the President has some issues to deal with when it comes to proving he was born in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And last month the Reverend Graham said also, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Muslim Brotherhood is very strong and active in our country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s infiltrated every level of our government,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning your administration.\xc2\xa0 So I want to know if the White House is concerned that a top religious figure is making charges of this nature about the President and his administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 David, I would just say I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that a religious leader would choose Easter Sunday to make preposterous charges.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:25 P.M.
