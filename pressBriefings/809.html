EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we begin this awesome two-day journey across the country that the President is looking forward to, as I know all of you are.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements on the official side this morning, but Jen has something for you from her end.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to quickly tick through the schedule.\xc2\xa0 And also, when you all arrive in Davenport, there will be some lovely printed books for you that include facts of each of the states we\'ll be visiting, even a map, has visual aids -- very exciting.</p>\n<p>So just to tick through, so the President will kick off his America Forward tour in Davenport, Iowa today.\xc2\xa0 Following the event in Iowa, the President will travel to Denver, Colorado for a grassroots event.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll then tape a Tonight Show with Jay Leno in L.A.\xc2\xa0 He will then hold a late-night rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, where Katy Perry will perform at the event.</p>\n<p>We\'ll return here, all snuggle on the plane.\xc2\xa0 The President will then fly overnight to Tampa, Florida for a morning grassroots event on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll travel to Richmond, Virginia, and then on to Chicago to make history by being the first sitting President to vote early.\xc2\xa0 And then he will end the America Forward tour with a tarmac rally in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Throughout the tour, as he\'s crisscrossing the country, he\'ll spend time on Air Force One calling undecided voters, rallying national team leaders and volunteers, and engaging with Americans across the country and reminding them of what\'s at stake in this election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ll also make some local stops as we tend to do on these sorts of visits, and we\'ll keep you abreast of those as they develop.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Questions, please.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, the President centered on a message lately that Governor Romney is untrustworthy, and I\'m wondering if you have any concern that that line of approach at the end here might turn off undecided voters, not just on what the President is running on but the central theme that Romney can\'t be trusted.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mitt Romney has made that case in this election on his own.\xc2\xa0 He has been untruthful about his positions with the American people.\xc2\xa0 He has hidden from the extremely conservative positions he\'s taken on issues ranging from women\'s health care to foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 And the stakes are high in this election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President not only lays out every day when he\'s out there on the campaign trail his positive vision for this country, his plan to continue to help the economy recover, make sure people have access to affordable health care, the ability to go to college, but he also reminds people of the choice and why it\'s so important to get engaged and involved in this stage in the election.</p>\n<p>And I think what we saw from Mitt Romney the other night at the debate was somebody who was not only uncertain but uncomfortable with his own positions on issues.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s simply just a reminder that people in this country want a commander-in-chief who they can trust to deliver on what they promised when they go into the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Polling shows that the number of undecided voters is incredibly small.\xc2\xa0 At this point in the campaign, is the President\'s goal still to try to sway people to his side, or have we shifted realistically to more of a mobilization of voters to get out the vote?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re right, we agree that the number of undecided voters is a very small pool and has been for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 So our focus is twofold:\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a far larger number of voters who have decided, who the President will be spending the next two days, crisscrossing six states, reminding them it\'s time to get out there to early vote, to get engaged, to door-knock, to make phone calls, and reminding them of what\'s at stake in this election.</p>\n<p>But there are also -- we certainly are also still fighting for every single one of the undecided votes that we can get.\xc2\xa0 We think there are persuadable people who are still out there, who are soft Romney supporters, but also people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet made up their minds.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President goes out there every day, lays out his vision for the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we have put out a plan that the President has talked about for months, but now people can share with their friends and neighbors so they have a very specific understanding of what the President would do with four more years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, can you talk a little bit about the genesis of this trip -- how long has it been being planned, where did that come from, and why are we doing it now and not the last week of the campaign?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, what if we do a 98-hour tour the last week?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'m just joking.\xc2\xa0 This has been a trip that has been in the works for weeks.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something we\'ve been very excited about for weeks.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously a number of complicated logistics involved with moving Air Force One, moving a plane of reporters, events, local stops, phone calls involved. So it\'s taken quite a bit of planning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re doing this now because we feel this is a pivotal time in the election -- always has.\xc2\xa0 On early vote, which is a big priority for us, people have started early voting; they\'re starting to early vote in places like Colorado, where we will be visiting today, this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As a reminder, four years ago, 78 percent of people in Colorado either voted by mail or early voted, which is a huge number.\xc2\xa0 Nevada -- they just started on Saturday early voting.\xc2\xa0 So -- and this is also not just about reminding people to go to the polls, which is a big part of it, it\'s about engaging our supporters, engaging volunteers.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you\'re volunteering one night a week; we need you to do three.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you are voting, but you haven\'t yet come in to make phone calls; we need you to make phone calls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is going to be pounding the pavement over the next two days, visiting all these states because he feels this is a pivotal time, and every single extra doorknob, every single extra phone call could make all the difference in what we think will be a razor-thin election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, the only states that we\'re visiting, the polls are deadlocked.\xc2\xa0 The President over the last few weeks has actually lost support in these states; Romney has gained support.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday on a conference call, Jim Messina, David Axelrod said that they expect the polls to stay this tight until the end.\xc2\xa0 So with no more debates, what are you guys looking for, what could change the dynamic?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would dispute one piece of that, and that is that we did see a slight bump in the polls for Romney after the first debate.\xc2\xa0 We fully expected the polls would tighten -- for months we have.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve long said that.\xc2\xa0 And whether it was the debate or something else that caused it, we always knew they\'d be closer towards the end.\xc2\xa0 The race has been very stable over the past -- actually since -- for the past week plus.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a couple -- so what we want out of this, out of the next two days, is to spend time in these pivotal states reminding people what\'s at stake, what the choice is in this election, and that now is the time to get engaged, to get involved and to vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you expect this trip to change polls?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We expect the race to be razor-thin until the end.\xc2\xa0 I will dispute a couple of things, since I have the opportunity here.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Romney team is spinning overtime about their secret momentum.\xc2\xa0 But the facts are not their forte.</p>\n<p>And there are a couple -- three points I just want to make on that.\xc2\xa0 One, we\'re tied or ahead in every single swing state.\xc2\xa0 Two, we\'re winning the early vote in every single swing state and we\'re ahead of where we were in 2008 on the early vote. And finally, even though the Romney team has been talking down the potential for minority turnout -- African American and Latino populations in this country -- we think it will be a record turnout.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen every indication of that up to date.\xc2\xa0 And that disputes kind of some of the points.</p>\n<p>So I know they\'ve thrown out secret polls, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any data to back up their points.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why aren\'t we going to North Carolina?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re going to six of the six to nine swing states over the next two days.\xc2\xa0 We have 13 days to go.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t even tell you what we\'re doing next week because we\'re still planning it, but we have plenty of time to go back there.\xc2\xa0 We sent the First Lady there.\xc2\xa0 We\'re up on the air.\xc2\xa0 We have people on the ground.\xc2\xa0 We feel very encouraged about the response to early vote that started just last week.</p>\n<p>And I know, again, that the Romney team is trying to spin that we are -- that they\'re so over-confident that -- we hope they are.\xc2\xa0 We hope they\'re over-confident there, because we\'re pounding the pavement there, we\'re getting voters out to the polls.\xc2\xa0 That is one of our best ground operations in the country. We\xe2\x80\x99ve registered hundreds of thousands of new voters.\xc2\xa0 And as far as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, they\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled one person out to have them work in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s hardly backing up their verbal assertions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on some of those stats that you just shared, would you say that it\xe2\x80\x99s your campaign that has the momentum?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we feel great about the last two debates and that has certainly energized our supporters.\xc2\xa0 We think we have a better candidate, that we have a ground game that\xe2\x80\x99s second to none, and that we have a better deal we\xe2\x80\x99re offering to middle-class families across the country.\xc2\xa0 Those are all advantages.</p>\n<p>But we know this race is going to be very, very close -- razor-thin in some of these states -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99re running.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to run like we\xe2\x80\x99re five points behind in every state, even when we\xe2\x80\x99re five points up, because we have 13 days to go and we\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep on November 7th.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And as I can say as a matter of policy that fundamentally this is a choice about plans for the future.\xc2\xa0 And Americans understand the depth of the crisis that faced this country when President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 They know the policies that precipitated that crisis.\xc2\xa0 They recognize that those same policies are being offered up to them again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And they know that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies have reversed what could have become a Great Depression; led to the creation of over 5 million private sector jobs; led to the salvations of the American auto industry; led to the resurgence of the manufacturing sector in our economy; led to historic investments in energy sectors that are crucial to our energy independence in the 21st century; led to a situation where we are importing less oil from foreign countries than in more than 15 years; led to the fulfillment of the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise to end the war in Iraq, refocus our attention on those who attacked us on September 11, 2001; led to the decimation of the senior leadership of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s central, including Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And I could go on.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a choice here, a policy choice here.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels very confident that the prescriptions he\xe2\x80\x99s putting forward are the right ones for continuing to grow the economy, continuing to create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in contrast, the alternative proposals out there -- his assertions are backed up by the analysis of independent economists.\xc2\xa0 When plans put forward by the other side have been assessed by outside sources, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been called, essentially, fraudulent.\xc2\xa0 A $5 trillion tax cut that benefits disproportionately the wealthiest Americans coupled with $2 trillion in additional defense spending the Pentagon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even want cannot be paid for by closing loopholes without sticking it to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 It is mathematically impossible.</p>\n<p>And having done this a few times -- with Brian and others -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the issues are.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the minutiae of momentum and ads and stuff.\xc2\xa0 In the end, Americans go to the polls to make a choice about which direction they want the country to go in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there are some emails that have emerged, which suggest that the White House and other areas of the government were told within hours of the Benghazi attack that an extremist group had claimed responsibility.\xc2\xa0 How is that compatible with the idea that it was a spontaneous attack?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There were emails about all sorts of information that was becoming available in the aftermath of the attack.\xc2\xa0 The email you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to was an open-source, unclassified email referring to an assertion made on a social media site that everyone in this room had access to and knew about instantaneously.</p>\n<p>There was a variety of information coming in.\xc2\xa0 The whole point of an intelligence community and what they do is to assess strands of information and make judgments about what happened and who was responsible.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve already said about, and what the DNI has already said about, the initial assessments of the intelligence community, and the fact that throughout this process, I and others made very clear that our preliminary assessments were preliminary, that an investigation was underway, and that as more facts became available, we would make the American people aware of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, this was an open-source, unclassified email about a posting on a Facebook site.\xc2\xa0 I would also note I think that within a few hours, that organization itself claimed that it had not been responsible.\xc2\xa0 Neither should be taken as fact -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation underway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One light question to end -- how much sleep did you guys get last night?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Not enough.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much are you going to get tonight?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be having a big party up front while you guys are sleeping.\xc2\xa0 No, just a few hours.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to be going on adrenaline for the next 36 hours or so.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the fun of it.\xc2\xa0 Nobody walk into oncoming traffic or into any glass-plated walls and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be good.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President get sleep last night -- hours?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not enough.\xc2\xa0 Not enough, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about the trip and the physical sort of rigor on him?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s excited about it.\xc2\xa0 He loves being on the ground, spending time visiting people where they work, where they\xe2\x80\x99re watching football, where they\xe2\x80\x99re eating.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to do that on this trip -- surprising people, which is always fun.</p>\n<p>And he\xe2\x80\x99s really energized by the crowds, the people he meets on the rope line and the people he meets backstage.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is a great way, and he feels this is a great way to kick off the final two weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he also be doing some interviews?\xc2\xa0 Phone interviews?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I will double-check for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he has any scheduled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, do you guys have any response to the Des Moines Register, what they\xe2\x80\x99ve written about the President doing an off-the-record discussion with them?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure, well, some important context here -- as you know, the President does interviews every single day, many of them you all use in your reporting, many of you have done interviews with him.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done many with the Des Moines Register, including one just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>This was a call -- he\xe2\x80\x99s done many editorial board meetings with them as well.\xc2\xa0 This was a call that was meant to be a personal check-in with a publisher and an editor, one of whom he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with in four years, one of whom he\xe2\x80\x99d never spoken with before.\xc2\xa0 They expressed a desire to put this on the record, make it public.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said that\xe2\x80\x99s fine and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be posting it this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They will print it?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Actually, can I add, since you didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you have all seen the comments of Senator Mourdock -- or not senator -- Mr. Mourdock from Indiana.\xc2\xa0 That was a bad slip.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously put out a statement from Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\xc2\xa0 I also wanted to add that the President felt those comments were outrageous and demeaning to women.\xc2\xa0 This is a reminder that a Republican Congress working with a Republican President, Mitt Romney, would feel that women should not be able to make choices about their own health care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is an issue where Mitt Romney is starring in an ad for this senator.\xc2\xa0 And it is perplexing that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t demand to have that ad taken down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say about Mitt Romney that he endorsed him to begin with?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Mitt Romney, that many Republicans who are running office, including him -- including Mr. Mourdock, have very extreme positions on issues that women care deeply about in this country, and that if they have the opportunity to be partners in the White House and in the Senate, that that\xe2\x80\x99s something women should have and will have concern about as they\xe2\x80\x99re going to the voting booths.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t9:52 A.M.
