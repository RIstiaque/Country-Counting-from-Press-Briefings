EDT</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have with me, as you can see, Betsey Stevenson, a member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers.\xc2\xa0 You may recall she briefed with me recently, and by popular demand she\xe2\x80\x99s back today to discuss the events, the roundtable the President is doing today, and the fact that it is the beginning of a series of events.</p>\n<p class="p4">So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask Betsey to speak to you first.\xc2\xa0 If you could direct questions on those subjects to her at the top, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to other subjects right after that.</p>\n<p class="p4">MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Great, thank you.\xc2\xa0 So, as you know, last week the President announced the date of the Working Families Summit, June 23rd.\xc2\xa0 And as Jay mentioned, today kicks off the first of a series of events and gatherings leading into that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be at Valencia College talking with a number of women with various experiences about their experiences in the labor force and their experiences in getting the skills they need to succeed in the labor force.</p>\n<p class="p4">Following this, there will be a series of regional events around the country in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Denver, and another one that I\xe2\x80\x99m forgetting.\xc2\xa0 But the -- New York?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the one I forgot?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">The goal of these events is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from real people along with hearing from businesses, from state and local governments, from members of Congress, for us to try to figure out what are the policies and changes that we need to make to better address the needs of working families in the labor force.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">The labor force, as I said in last week\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, has been changing and changing quite rapidly.\xc2\xa0 We are moving to a world in which soon women will be the majority of the highly skilled workers.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re now graduating at rates much higher than men, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing so now for two decades.</p>\n<p class="p4">And as women continue to gain skills, continue to participate in the labor force, and continue to earn a large and increasing share of household earnings, making sure that the labor force is making the best use of their talents is important not just for women and for families, but to make sure that the U.S. stays as competitive as possible in the 21st century.</p>\n<p class="p4">So why don\xe2\x80\x99t I turn to questions.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Is the President planning to do any of these other regional events, or just this first one?</p>\n<p class="p4">MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 The President will be doing this first one, and then other members of the administration will be doing the other events.\xc2\xa0 I believe Valerie Jarrett is going to be in New York.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be in Boston.\xc2\xa0 I know Secretary Perez is going to be in San Francisco, and I think a few of the other ones.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to be involving members of Congress in these events.\xc2\xa0 So, for instance, I know that the event in Boston will have members of Congress there.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If women are increasingly getting higher education degrees and occupying the workplace -- better jobs in the workplace, what is the government\xe2\x80\x99s role in speeding that process or improving that process?</p>\n<p class="p4">MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Improving which -- the process --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why should the government become involved in effecting that?</p>\n<p class="p4">MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the government should become involved in, say, changing the degree to which women -- the government should be involved in making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to make the best use of America\xe2\x80\x99s talent, whoever is holding that talent, and making sure that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t artificial or unnecessary constraints that prevent that talent from reaching its potential.</p>\n<p class="p4">The point of this summit is to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s the role\xc2\xa0 -- what government can and should do; what businesses can and should do; what individuals can and should do; and what state and local governments can and should do in order to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re making the best use of our talent, and not having people make decisions that perhaps reflect artificial barriers.</p>\n<p class="p4">And to give you an example -- academics -- notably, Claudia Goldin, has pointed out that a lot of women today choose professions not based on necessarily where their talents are best suited, but where they might have more flexibility in balancing work and family.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, to the extent that we can, it would be better to remove some of those barriers so that women could go where their talents were going to be most successful, rather than making choices based on the constraints they face of balancing work and family.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why Florida for the first event?\xc2\xa0 How much did politics play into the location of the first one?</p>\n<p class="p4">MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t pick locations, so I can\'t answer that.\xc2\xa0 I think what we know about Valencia College -- so I can certainly tell you what is so great about Valencia College.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, the President announced in 2010 the Aspen Prize for community college that demonstrates excellence, and Valencia College was the first community college to win that price.\xc2\xa0 They won it in 2011.</p>\n<p class="p4">This is a community college that\xe2\x80\x99s been extremely successful in educating both men and women, helping them transition successfully into jobs or, actually, into higher education.\xc2\xa0 They do a really good job of educating older students and students with children.\xc2\xa0 So this is a location that certainly demonstrates I think many of the multiple challenges that women face.\xc2\xa0 So it demonstrates -- one thing people don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate is more than a fifth of female college students have children.\xc2\xa0 So when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about balancing family and work, a lot of times they\xe2\x80\x99re balancing the need to get skills in order to support their family at the same time they actually have that family.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And I think a lot of the students at Valencia College are dealing with exactly that challenge.\xc2\xa0 Many of the workers within the community deal with some of the challenges that everyday women face, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re able to get a good snapshot at some of the challenges that women face through the people invited to participate in this roundtable.</p>\n<p class="p4">The only other thing is just the BLS released the annual report on veterans data today; it came out at 10 a.m.\xc2\xa0 And it showed that we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to make progress in bringing down the unemployment rate of veterans.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we can look at the unemployment rate of veterans every month, but this annual report allows us to dig deeper into looking at veterans who\xe2\x80\x99ve recently served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and understand who is doing a good job of transitioning back to the civilian workforce.\xc2\xa0 And the top line of this was that where it shows that for Gulf War II veterans or more recent veterans, we have now brought the unemployment rate down from its peak of 12.1 in 2011 to 9 percent in 2013.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to make progress.</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you all heard -- or I hope you heard, because you were on the plane -- did you hear the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement?\xc2\xa0 Were you able to hear it?</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We got notes from that.</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You got notes from it.\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, as you know, the President this morning, prior to leaving the White House, announced new sanctions under the existing executive orders designating additional individuals in the Russian government as well as individuals not in government office but who have substantial assets and substantial influence over and with government officials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">He also announced that he has signed a new executive order that creates the authorities for sanctions in sectors of the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 For details about that, I would refer you to the Treasury Department, which I know has put out paper on it.\xc2\xa0 But that was essentially the announcement he made.\xc2\xa0 And he also reiterated that taking these actions has been necessitated by choices the Russian government has made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p6">Pursuing sanctions, especially those that would come potentially with the authorities created in the executive order<span class="s1">,</span> is not our preferred choice, because in addition to the damage those sanctions might inflict on the Russian economy, there could be an impact on the global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p6">But what Russia has done has flagrantly violated international law as well as the agreements that Russia has with the sovereign state of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And Russia still has the opportunity to de-escalate and take steps to engage in a dialogue with the Ukrainian government in order to address the concerns the Russian government says it has in a manner consistent with international law and in a manner that does not violate the sovereignty of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">Any questions?</p>\n<p class="p5">Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see if there was a list put out of names.\xc2\xa0 Are these more members of Putin\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle that have been added?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there are additional government officials, as well as influential individuals who are not in government.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the list, unfortunately.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the list put out?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was the bank named as well?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are these sanctions that the President told Putin in his phone call would be imposed were he not to take certain actions?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more detailed readout of that phone call.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, President Putin and other Russian government officials should not be surprised that these actions are being taken both by us and by our allies.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear all along that the intervention in Crimea, the violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, the escalation intentions have all been at odds with international law and with the interest of stability in the region.\xc2\xa0 So those are the consequences if Russia chose not to de-escalate and if Russia chose to continue down the path that it\'s on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p8">So I don\'t have a specific exchange in a conversation to relate to you except that you can be sure that Russian government officials understand that these are the kinds of actions that their choices have made it necessary to take.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any other calls today on the plane at all since making this announcement?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Any other calls?\xc2\xa0 I have no calls to read out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid sent a letter supporting Senator Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with regard to CIA spying on the committee; called it a breach and unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 In light of adding his voice to those concerns, does the President feel the need to take any action to rein in the CIA or to address this difference between -- obviously the Senator has been a strong supporter of the CIA.</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The disputes around the protocols established in 2009 for the provision of documents to the committee are being reviewed by an independent inspector general as well as the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s appropriate, and I\'m not going to comment on what are ongoing reviews.\xc2\xa0 So I have nothing new to add to that discussion.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that General Sinclair received an appropriate sentence?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on an individual case like that.\xc2\xa0 You understand from what the President has said in the past how seriously he views the issue of sexual assault in general, and in particular in the military.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the actions that we\'ve taken and the actions the Department of Defense has undertaken.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to comment on an individual case.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are we on this plane today?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have the specific guidance here somewhere, but the larger plane required maintenance and so we\'re on this plane.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And speaking of planes, the FBI obviously is involved in the search and investigation in Malaysia.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything to read into their involvement that there is indication of criminal action?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are assisting in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 We, the United States are providing assistance through the FAA and the NTSB, and through the FBI.\xc2\xa0 We are receiving excellent cooperation from the Malaysian government, which has the lead obviously in both the search and in the investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p8">We have no new information or conclusions to provide about what happened to the plane.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously assisting in the search in the Indian Ocean in the areas that the Prime Minister outlined over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And in case you were going to ask me about the reports of the debris, I just have no updates on that except that we\'re participating in the search as a general matter.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason that the President is not appearing with Governor Crist today?\xc2\xa0 Clearly, Governor Crist has been a big, outspoken supporter of the President and his health care plan, and I know you all said you want to help out with the gubernatorial, the races in the midterm.</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Governor Crist.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the answer to that question.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p7">END<br/>\n1:09 P.M.
