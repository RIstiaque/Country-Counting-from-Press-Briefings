EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One. As you know, we are en route to Atlanta, where the President is going to talk about the rising challenge in this country of helping students afford a higher education and manage their debt.</p>\n<p>Right before we left, the President did sign a memorandum directing the Department of Education and other federal agencies to work across the federal government to do more to help borrowers afford their monthly loan payments through 19 new executive actions.\xc2\xa0 That memo requires a new single system for student complaints, contractors to respond when borrowers fall behind in their payments, and recommendations for other policy changes to protect borrowers.</p>\n<p>The actions we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing today will help reach our goal of providing an affordable, quality education for all Americans, underscored in the Student Aid Bill of Rights, based upon the fundamental principle that every student in this country deserves access to a quality, affordable education at an institution that\xe2\x80\x99s cutting costs and increasing learning.</p>\n<p>With that, I am happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the Admiral who joined the President this morning -- what can you tell us about him?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The Admiral is a proud and active alum of Georgia Tech University, so he is joining us in that capacity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a different topic, Hillary Clinton is going to give some remarks today publicly for the first time since the whole swirling email controversy.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specific you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to hear from her?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on a press conference that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask some Hillary follow-ups?\xc2\xa0 Is the expectation that in her disclosure of all the emails that she has asked the State Department to turn over that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing emails between her and the President?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As Josh acknowledged yesterday, there are some emails that were sent and received between the Secretary of State and the President of the United States in that first term.\xc2\xa0 Those emails, A, would have been preserved, as Josh has said, under the Presidential Records Act, based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s email; and, two, have now been turned over to the State Department for review for release.\xc2\xa0 So the State Department, by matter of course, goes through those documents and judges for a host of criteria what\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for release.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let that process play out before I prejudge it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But one of the criteria would be if the President exerts privilege over them in some way.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys plan to do, or do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re happy with the State Department releasing any email between the President and Secretary Clinton?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re jumping about 10,000 steps ahead of where we are, so let\xe2\x80\x99s just let the State Department review that process under their regular order and then we can make a determination from there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the Democrats that are on the House Benghazi panel have asked -- there is some 800 or so pages of emails that have already been turned over to the Benghazi committee -- they want those emails to be prioritized and released -- reviewed for release first, before the other 55,000 pages.\xc2\xa0 Is that a request that the White House supports?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.\xc2\xa0 But, again, the review of that set of documents has to go through the State Department, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to defer to their folks and their team so they can evaluate it under the proper criteria before releasing those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have his own private email, a nongovernmental email that he uses occasionally or at all?\xc2\xa0 And has he used it to conduct government business?\xc2\xa0 And if so, would he be subject to the policies that Josh outlined?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Mike, both the President and my colleague, Josh Earnest, have addressed this in the past couple of days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- addressed it.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, in engaging questions on the security and integrity of the President\xe2\x80\x99s email, we have made clear that part of the security precautions we take around that email account is not talking about it much publicly.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to talk about the email account.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about whether he has a private email account.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a different question than asking about the secured -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for what it is, although if you want to give it to me, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with that.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Mike, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s email account.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you that anything sent or received there is preserved for a couple of different reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, nobody understands more the scholarly value of that material than the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 As you saw a few days ago, the President took his family to see President Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Second Inaugural Address.\xc2\xa0 So we understand the scholarly value.\xc2\xa0 We also understand the rules and guidelines that dictate this sort of material and we abide by them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President -- Josh said that the President had, in fact, received those emails, as you mentioned today.\xc2\xa0 When he is receiving emails from other members of government or other world leaders that are from .gov or other official accounts, was it not at all weird to him or questionable that his emails from Secretary Clinton were not as such?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation when sending or receiving an email from any Cabinet Secretary is that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be preserved, maintained, and archived in accordance with the Federal Records Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given he knew it was a personal email, that didn\'t seem weird to him that someone was emailing the President of the United States from a Clintonmail server address?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation in real time is that those emails are archived and preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, are you and your colleagues sick of answering questions about Hillary Clinton and what emails she did or didn\'t send?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, our view is that we take these guidelines seriously.\xc2\xa0 We take compliance very seriously, so we are happy to engage you in questions on this today or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the college thing?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait till you hear my question.\xc2\xa0 Seems like small potatoes.\xc2\xa0 I mean is this because Congress is in the hands of the Republicans and you can\'t really do much more than create a new complaint system?\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t seem to address in any sort of fundamental way the challenges of somebody paying back a $50,000 loan.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I guess I would disagree with your characterization of this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the 1.4 million student loan borrowers in the state of Georgia, for example, who have accumulated more than $44 billion left in outstanding student loan debt would call these sorts of improvements small potatoes. I do agree with you there is lots more to be done in addition to what we\'re talking about specifically today.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why the President has called on Congress to support his plan to allow for a free community college for two years for responsible Americans.\xc2\xa0 That is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve called for an expansion of the Pell program.\xc2\xa0 That is why we\'re looking for increased investments in our first in the world expansion, where we seed innovation and scaling what works in higher education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I agree with you this is a priority.\xc2\xa0 I agree with you there\xe2\x80\x99s lots to be done.\xc2\xa0 We think the steps being announced today are an important step.\xc2\xa0 But surely -- hopefully those in Congress share your drive to do more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Iran real quick?\xc2\xa0 Foreign Minister Zarif today said that the letter sent by Republicans was evidence that the U.S. was unreliable in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 This was sort of a break from what we had heard from him yesterday where he had sort of dismissed the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 letter.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you guys interpreted that as him sort of playing to the hard line audience that he was speaking to, or if you guys are worried that this letter has not tangibly damaged or jeopardized the negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think we feel like this was a blatant, flagrant, and partisan attempt to interfere with the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 As my colleagues have said, we have one President at a time in the United States, and that President is charged with conducting our foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 As the Vice President said quite eloquently last night, the letter that was released yesterday is without precedent from the past two centuries based on the role that the United States Senate has played.\xc2\xa0 So we feel like that letter was reckless, was irresponsible, was misguided, was a partisan attempt to undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to negotiate with a foreign government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has it been effective in that goal, though?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys seeing tangible concerns being expressed through the negotiating?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any data on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a real-time update on the actual negotiations, which, again, are sort of happening in real time.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have any update for you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me tackle that from a different direction.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s argument to Congress has been that if these talks are unsuccessful there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any excuse for Iran to say this is on the U.S. as opposed to on Iran.\xc2\xa0 But between the Bibi speech and this letter and the sanctions legislation in Congress, if these talks now fail, doesn\'t Iran already have a pretty persuasive argument that it\xe2\x80\x99s because of Congress that this deal fell apart, not because Iran walked away from the table?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised an important point, Josh, that the negotiations that the United States is a part of are not bilateral with just Iran.\xc2\xa0 We are involved in a complicated, sensitive negotiation with Russia, with the United Kingdom, with France and Germany, the European Union, and China.</p>\n<p>So you are right that these are sensitive and these are complicated.\xc2\xa0 And so if there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be 47 members of the same political party who attempt to inject themselves in an attempt to undermine the negotiation, we do feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s misguided.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the White House doing, particularly with its partners in these talks, to sort of address any concerns the White House has about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xc2\xa0 Like are partners asking questions about what does this mean?\xc2\xa0 What is the White House actively doing to sort of talk to people about this?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations or communications specifically with the P5-plus-1 group to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I can say that through the State Department, the negotiations to reach a deal continue, they continue in earnest, and they continue with an urgency as the deadline approaches.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious there\xe2\x80\x99s a real rift here now between Republicans in the Senate and the White House.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House going to do for its part to try to address this rift or repair this rift, if anything?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is it\xe2\x80\x99s important to realize that, historically, the President has the role of executing on our foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 So whether that\xe2\x80\x99s looking at basing agreements for troops around the world, whether that is the agreement to rid Syria of chemical weapons -- a framework that we establish with Russia -- or whether that is a withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, those are agreements that the President of the United States, the executive branch, worked on and coordinated with foreign governments around the world.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important piece of history.</p>\n<p>And then the second thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is that there is a robust role for Congress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an oversight role, there\xe2\x80\x99s a consultative role.\xc2\xa0 The reason we have such severe sanctions right now on Iran that brought them to the negotiating table is because of those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 So we are on constant communication with the Hill, but what we don\xe2\x80\x99t think is a good idea is a partisan attempt to undermine the negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Senator Menendez really quickly?\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Josh\xe2\x80\x99s spiel about how you guys can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on whether or not an indictment is coming, but we heard from Kathleen Sebelius last night that she had been interviewed by prosecutors about Senator Menendez and the donor in question. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, do you know if anybody on the White House staff has been interviewed by federal prosecutors?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the White House cooperate with such an investigation, or is that a situation where if a meeting between a donor and a White House staffer had come up that you guys would exert any sort of privilege?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think you are presupposing a lot of facts that aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily been stipulated, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have anything to engage you on that hypothetical.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, on the situation in Myanmar and the protestors that have been beaten by police while demonstrating against an educational law.\xc2\xa0 This is the country that the President has repeatedly held up an as example of moving towards democratization, so is Myanmar still on the right track?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw those reports.\xc2\xa0 We, of course, deplore any violence.\xc2\xa0 The values of human rights and fundamental freedoms are something that the President holds dear, something that this White House takes very seriously, and something that we work to spread around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I guess on one other foreign policy question, the President and his aides have said that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a decision on whether to send lethal aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Germany\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the U.S. told the AP yesterday that in the meeting with Merkel the President agreed to hold off and not to send lethal aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So was the German ambassador incorrect in that statement?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I saw the story from your colleague.\xc2\xa0 The truth is we do not have an update from when the President addressed this with most of you in the room with Chancellor Merkel there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes, first and foremost, that this is a situation that is going to have to be resolved diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s for a couple of different reasons.\xc2\xa0 First, increasing arms and lethal aid to the region would only increase bloodshed; two, nobody doubts Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military capacity to expand its military presence in the region; and three, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see increased bloodshed --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re making the case against sending lethal aid, so is that a conclusion that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached by this administration?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to finish my answer.\xc2\xa0 But the President has also said we are constantly reevaluating the situation there, constantly looking at new options. And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that at this time, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you said it remains where it was, where it was was he said that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet made a decision.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 That is what he said during the Merkel thing.\xc2\xa0 So it remains that he has not yet made a decision?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has said a couple of different times why he believes this is a conflict that has to be resolved at the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 One, adding lethal aid only increases bloodshed; two, nobody doubts Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to increase their military presence in the region.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to exhaust diplomatic agreements; that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that Russia has to live up to its agreements in the Minsk agreements that were agreed to repeatedly, several times now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator\xe2\x80\x99s Menendez and Corker sent the President a letter yesterday asking for a report that under law was due on February 15th, and the report is supposed to spell out the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy on defensive lethal aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you have any update about when that report might be delivered to Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I will be honest with you, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that letter.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on this I think is fairly well-known.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing different than when he addressed this with Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 He also addressed this with CBS over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And I think I tried to just outline where the President\xe2\x80\x99s head is on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I ask real quickly about the statement on Scott Walker that came out last night?\xc2\xa0 Irrespective of the merits, is this going to be something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President do more, kind of dip his toe into 2016 and the Republican primary process by talking about issues that are coming up with some of their candidates?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is irrespective of the merits, so I sort of reject that framing of the question.\xc2\xa0 I think that this is an issue that the President has spoken out on repeatedly, whether it\'s in Wisconsin, whether it\'s been in Michigan, or Ohio.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that unions have been the backbone of our middle class and helped build our economy, our workforce, and that we should be doing everything possible to help workers join unions and build unions, not tear them apart.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is at least the third time that the President has spoken about one of the potential Republican 2016 contenders. Is this something that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to do, to sort of inject himself into the 2016 race?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I saw a lot of the political commentary speculating that that\xe2\x80\x99s what we were doing, but our bottom line is this is an issue that we have spoken out whenever it rears its ugly head.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that unions have played a central role in building the middle class and raising workers\xe2\x80\x99 wages.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, instead of rolling back workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights, states, including Wisconsin, should be expanding workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights, like raising the minimum wage and paid sick leave.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:20 A.M.
