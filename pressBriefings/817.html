PDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Bakersfield, California, where, as you know, the President will be speaking about the designation of La Paz as a national monument.\xc2\xa0 We discussed that yesterday, can certainly take more questions on that if you like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I have no other announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 Jen may have something at the top.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Just as a follow-up to a question you guys asked yesterday, because I\'m here to please you -- on the fundraising the 48 hours after the debate, I know the Romney team released their number, which I believe was $12 million in the 48 hours.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you because of a strong response from our grassroots supporters, from people who want to see the President go back for another four years, that we raised more than that in the 48 hours following the debate.\xc2\xa0 In fact, if you look back at our numbers from September, that\'s about the daily average -- about $6 million a day if you were to do the daily average of our numbers in September.</p>\n<p>So I don\'t have any other specifics than that, but I just wanted to get back to you on that particular piece.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What made you decide to tell us that?\xc2\xa0 Because usually you guys don\'t reveal those sorts of things in the middle of the cycle.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We have before.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was just important to remind you that we have a lot of people out there who are excited to see the President go back for another four years; that we had 30,000 people in Wisconsin last week; we\'ve had an overwhelming response from our grassroots supports.\xc2\xa0 And it was something you asked and it was something I was able to deliver the information on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\'t give us the exact number, just that it was more than $12 million?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I cannot.\xc2\xa0 More than $12 million.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, before the debate, the campaign told us that you expected Romney to do well; that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the measure, the measure was what comes of it.\xc2\xa0 Particularly in states like Ohio, will we see any changes?\xc2\xa0 Can you speak from the campaign\'s perspective whether you are seeing any changes, whether there is any tightening of the polls?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speak to our internal poll numbers, as I\'m sure comes as no surprise to you.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve long said long before the debate that we expected the race to tighten and we don\'t expect that in the polls that showed us 10 points and even more points up in Ohio that that would be the final margin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the people in Ohio are looking at who\'s going to be a better fighter for them in the White House.\xc2\xa0 And the decision -- the factors haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed since the debate, so who\'s going to fight for middle-class tax cuts, who\'s going to fight to make sure kids have access to affordable health care, can go to college.\xc2\xa0 In Ohio, there are some specific issues, like who is -- who fought to bring the auto industry back.\xc2\xa0 We all know Mitt Romney wanted to let the auto industry go bankrupt, and one in eight jobs in Ohio relies on the auto industry.</p>\n<p>We\'ve been back to Ohio; we\'ll be back again.\xc2\xa0 We know there are many other states that we\'re going to be competing in and fighting for every last vote.\xc2\xa0 But the decision-making -- the issues that we were debating before the campaign and the choice between the candidates has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the reasons the President\'s message has been so consistent, not just before and after the debate but for months.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President read or heard Mitt Romney\'s foreign policy remarks?\xc2\xa0 What\'s his reaction, and what\'s your reaction to the details that he laid out today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe the President has read or seen the remarks yet, but we have, and I\'ll let Jen start.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 A couple things I\'ll say.\xc2\xa0 One is this is Mitt Romney\'s seventh attempt by our count to reboot his foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 When you\'re commander-in-chief you don\'t get to bring an Etch-a-Sketch into the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t get second chances, never mind seventh chances.</p>\n<p>And as the American people are looking at what he had to say today, but also his record from the last few months, the areas that should be of concern are that this is somebody who leads with chest-pounding rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 He\'s inexperienced.\xc2\xa0 He\'s been clumsy at his handling of foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 And most of all, all of these factors lead to a risk that we\'re going to go back to the same policies that led us to some of the challenges we faced in the last few years.</p>\n<p>He\'s surrounded himself with people who are out of the mainstream.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to highlight a couple of things that were in the speech that stuck out to us.\xc2\xa0 One is that he doubled down on comments he made in a closed door -- the 47 percent closed-door event that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all chatted about quite a bit, where he talked about leaving troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He led -- he said today that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the handling was done correctly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President disagrees with him on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn down our troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 They have a strong difference of opinion.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proudest accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Second is he indicated that the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t signed trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 That is not only absurd, it\xe2\x80\x99s inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s basing it on an absurd premise that President Bush signed a couple of trade agreements, but the fact remains that the President renegotiated the trade agreements -- made them better for American workers, made them better for the American auto industry and the American meat industry -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we not only got them through Congress, but the President actually signed them into law.</p>\n<p>So overall, we heard a lot of rhetoric, an out-of-the-mainstream rhetoric from Mitt Romney this morning.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that the American people have some serious questions about whether he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to be Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, who would you describe as being -- in Romney\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy circle as being outside the mainstream?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s surrounded himself with a number of people who were advisors to past President Bush, people who have been saber-rattling -- have used saber-rattling rhetoric when it comes to Syria and Iran, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we think the American people should take a look at.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on his -- he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention China and obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s been a big campaign issue.\xc2\xa0 Were you guys struck by that in any way?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And also, Jay, if you could address what he said about Egypt in terms of putting conditions on U.S. aid?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on Egypt I would simply say that this President has supported the people of the region in their historic attempt to transform their countries and their governments into ones that are responsive to the interests of the people, that are more democratic and more able to create prosperity for more people.\xc2\xa0 And that has been true in Egypt as it has been true throughout the region.</p>\n<p>The President believes we need to support a democratic transition in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that I think is striking about the speech that Governor Romney gave is that on the one hand he says -- he suggests the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been supportive enough of the democratic aspirations of people in the region, and on the other hand he suggests that we should withdraw our conditioned support for those who are trying to achieve a brighter future, a more democratic future in the region.</p>\n<p>Contradictions are, I know, fairly prevalent in his statements about foreign policy as well as other policy, but this is particularly striking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On China, I can simply say that this President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is clear.\xc2\xa0 We have a broad and deep relationship with China that is extremely important.\xc2\xa0 We cooperate in a number of areas, but we are clear with the Chinese on matters where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 And when there are issues that we have with the Chinese in terms of trade policy that put American workers and businesses at a disadvantage, this President acts.\xc2\xa0 And he has acted at a rate before the WTO that -- twice of his predecessor.\xc2\xa0 And in all of those actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s put before the WTO, the United States has prevailed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that demonstrates this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to American workers and American businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add, I mean, it is striking that -- obviously I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through every single piece of the speech -- that on an issue like China, where Mitt Romney has gone out there and used so much heated rhetoric about how the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t the right leader, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the right plans, that he would fail to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 And it kind of harkens you back to him failing to talk about Afghanistan and failing to talk about the troops in his convention speech.</p>\n<p>So the question is, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what kind of commander-in-chief Mitt Romney will be, and all we can -- would be.\xc2\xa0 All we can delve into is kind of who he surrounds himself with, his rhetoric and his repeated attempts to reboot his policies.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important as a matter of policy to look at what he said about Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This was a long military engagement that President Obama, when he ran for office, made clear that he would end more responsibly than it was begun under President Bush.\xc2\xa0 That is a commitment the President made and it is a commitment that he fulfilled, a promise that he kept.</p>\n<p>In what seems simply to be an attempt to draw a distinction with this President without any policy forethought, Governor Romney is now saying we should have tens of thousands of troops still in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And this President is happy to debate that issue, because he profoundly disagrees.\xc2\xa0 And that is why he kept his promise and withdrew all of our forces from Iraq.</p>\n<p>In Afghanistan it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing.\xc2\xa0 This President inherited a policy that was adrift, that was under-resourced, that Governor Romney had supported and other Republican leaders had supported.\xc2\xa0 He kept his commitment to redouble our efforts against al Qaeda, to fully resource our mission in Afghanistan, to hone that mission so that its objectives were clear and achievable.\xc2\xa0 And he has fulfilled that, and we are now in the process of drawing down our presence in Afghanistan and ending that war.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything besides -- keep mentioning Iraq -- that you saw that was different with what Governor Romney said and where the President is on certain policies?\xc2\xa0 He talked about Syria, he talked about army opposition, but his staff says that that would be done through other partners, not directly by the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Did you -- anything notable in what he said about Iran?\xc2\xa0 He also said that he supports the 2014 drawdown in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty similar in terms of where they stand on a number of these issues.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say, as matters of policy, this has been frequently the case -- that on Iran, for example, there has been a lot of heated rhetoric and chest-thumping, but every concrete prescription that the President\xe2\x80\x99s critics, including Governor Romney, have put forward -- concrete prescriptions that make sense have been acted on.\xc2\xa0 We have the most intense sanctions regime in history -- an effort this President has led internationally.\xc2\xa0 We have diplomatic isolation and international isolation that\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented in history, and it\xe2\x80\x99s having a profound impact on both the Iranian economy and the Iranian regime\xe2\x80\x99s internal political structure.</p>\n<p>On Israel, there\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt to draw a distinction and to suggest that this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is not strong, and yet Israel\xe2\x80\x99s leaders themselves have said that military cooperation and support, and intelligence cooperation and support from this President and this administration is unprecedented in the U.S.-Israeli relationship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Those are the facts.\xc2\xa0 And this President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy record is very strong.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of foreign policy, can you react to the election results in Venezuela?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Venezuelan National Elections Commission has declared that President Hugo Chavez won reelection, I believe roughly 54 to 45 percent, with 90 percent reporting.\xc2\xa0 We congratulate the Venezuelan people on the high level of participation, as well as on what was a relatively peaceful election process.\xc2\xa0 I would note the challenger has conceded the race.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything else to say about Chavez?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have our differences with President Chavez, but we congratulate the Venezuelan people on a process that included high levels of participation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Do you see any distinctions between the President\xe2\x80\x99s positions on how to handle that crisis and what the Governor says in his speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Short of -- I think the President has been very clear about what our interests are:\xc2\xa0 Assad must go.\xc2\xa0 We must work with our friends and allies around the world and in the region to put pressure on Assad to make clear that Syria\'s future cannot include him because the Syrian people demand a transition and a change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we have worked very closely with the Friends of Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have worked through -- or attempted to work through the United Nations Security Council, and we continue to work with our allies and partners to help bring about that change.\xc2\xa0 We provide substantial assistance, humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, and substantial non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 We work with our partners to help the Syrian opposition form itself.\xc2\xa0 And we support those elements in the opposition that aspire to a democratic and inclusive future for Syria.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 One thing I would just add is -- I mean, I would flip this question to Mitt Romney and his team.\xc2\xa0 He said that the President and his team are not doing enough when it comes to Syria, when it comes to Libya, and several events in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 What exactly are they suggesting we do?\xc2\xa0 What exactly is their plan and their proposal?\xc2\xa0 So if they\xe2\x80\x99re going farther, they should say that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a politics question?\xc2\xa0 So last night at two of the fundraisers where the President made public remarks, he talked about basically not knocking it out of the park with the debate.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious why he\xe2\x80\x99s decided to incorporate that into his speeches.\xc2\xa0 Is it -- does he feel that his supporters want to hear an acknowledgement from him that the debate was less than perfect?\xc2\xa0 And is this a message we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear going forward?\xc2\xa0 Basically, what\xe2\x80\x99s the strategic thinking in his comments twice last night?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was having a light moment last night, acknowledging that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his best performance, that his opponent had a much more theatrical performance.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than that.</p>\n<p>And the majority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks last night and moving forward will be about the choice in this election and the differences between their policies and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he thinks is the most important.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:04 A.M. PDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
