Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:15 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen -- good morning still.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 As you can see, we have with us today the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.\xc2\xa0 You saw him probably over the weekend where he discussed the impacts of sequestration, if that takes place, on areas he oversees in education.\xc2\xa0 So I brought him here today -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked him here today to elaborate on that, take your questions on that.</p>\n<p>As we have in the past, with Secretaries LaHood and Napolitano, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask that you direct your question towards him at the top.\xc2\xa0 Then, when we\xe2\x80\x99re done with that portion of the briefing, we can allow the Secretary to leave and I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain to take your questions on other issues.</p>\n<p>We do have a fairly hard stop here, because the President will be speaking on Capitol Hill around 11:50 a.m., I think -- 11:45, 11:50.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to move through this expeditiously.</p>\n<p>With that, I give you Secretary Duncan.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a couple things and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take any questions you might have.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to just start by sort of saying how I spent most of the past couple days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday -- last Thursday, the Vice President and I traveled to Connecticut to talk about the issue of gun violence, to meet with many of the families from the Sandy Hook massacre, to meet with other family members who have lost their loved ones.\xc2\xa0 And a really moving, gut-wrenching, emotional day, with just extraordinary families.</p>\n<p>On Friday, I traveled to New York City and went to an amazing high school -- you have to take a ferry to get there -- the Harbor School.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just a unique curriculum in which young people -- this idea of college and careers, rather than one versus the other.\xc2\xa0 Marine biology, restoration -- just amazing work that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 And I think the kind of school we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see be a model for the country.</p>\n<p>And then, on Monday, I was with Alma Powell and America\xe2\x80\x99s Promise, talking about the increase in high school graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 And clearly, we have a long, long way to go.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still not high enough.\xc2\xa0 But to see the high school graduation rate going up, to see dropout rates going down -- a lot less children going to dropout factories.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s driving the increase in graduation rates is increases amongst the Hispanic and the African American population.\xc2\xa0 Really encouraging trends.\xc2\xa0 A long way to go.\xc2\xa0 Not declaring success.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of work I like to be talking to you guys about.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of meaty, real substantive issues that I think we as a nation should be focused on.\xc2\xa0 But obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s not why I\xe2\x80\x99m here today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here to talk about sequester.\xc2\xa0 And what I will try and do is sort of walk quickly through the impact on our cradle-to-career agenda of sequester, and then open it up for any questions.</p>\n<p>First, on the early childhood side -- and, as you know, we want to invest a lot more there, and we keep saying that\xe2\x80\x99s the best investment we can make as a country if we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about closing the opportunity gap -- getting our babies ready to enter kindergarten, to be successful.\xc2\xa0 On the early childhood side, a cut of about $400 million.\xc2\xa0 What that means concretely is as many as 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start slots this fall, and as many as 14,000 teachers who teach those children would lose those jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that money does not come from our department, it obviously comes from HHS.\xc2\xa0 But this is just trying to talk about what impacts kids.</p>\n<p>On the K-12 side, as you guys know, the vast majority of our funding goes to two different situations.\xc2\xa0 And we always are funding at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the minority investor.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re usually 8 to 10 percent of school districts\xe2\x80\x99 budgets; 80 to 90 percent is local.\xc2\xa0 But what we do is we help support the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable children.\xc2\xa0 So the two biggest pots there are Title I money, which is money for poor children -- children who live below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 That total pot is $14.5 billion.\xc2\xa0 And then money for students with special needs\xc2\xa0 -- special education -- and that total pot is about $12 billion.</p>\n<p>What these cuts would mean on Title I is $725 million would be cut, and as many as 10,000 teachers could lose their jobs -- teachers and teachers\xe2\x80\x99 aides.\xc2\xa0 And on the special ed side, that\xe2\x80\x99s $600 million, and about 7,200 teachers would lose their jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get into this in Q&amp;A.\xc2\xa0 People say, what if you had more discretion?\xc2\xa0 What if you had more choice?\xc2\xa0 Those two pots together -- about $25 billion -- they dwarf anything else we do.\xc2\xa0 So the only choice I could make would be to hurt fewer poor children and help more special needs kids, or do the opposite.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a no-win proposition there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no good answer.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I could do to come up with a smarter way to do this.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re hurting poor kids or hurting kids with special needs one way -- either way you go.</p>\n<p>On the higher education side -- a cut of about $86 million.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the President has challenged us to try and lead the world in college graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 That cut would mean for the fall as many as 70,000 students would lose access to grants and to work-study opportunities.\xc2\xa0 And we know -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many of you are paying tuition -- college is very expensive today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something else we\xe2\x80\x99re working on.\xc2\xa0 And if young people lose access to grants and lose access to work-study, my fear -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any numbers yet -- but my fear is many of them would not be able to enroll in college, would not be able to go back.\xc2\xa0 And, again, do we want a less-educated workforce?\xc2\xa0 Do we want fewer people going to college in this country, or do we want more?\xc2\xa0 So real clear choices there.</p>\n<p>All of those cuts I walked through -- the early childhood piece, the K-12 piece, the higher ed piece -- those are all cuts that would be hitting in the fall.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of churn now, lots of -- over the next month or two you\xe2\x80\x99ll see lots of pink slips go out.\xc2\xa0 That starting is still really early on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s usually March and April where that happens, but these are all things that would happen for the fall.</p>\n<p>The one set of cuts that I think is very important that you understand that hits now, that hits March 1st, are those -- it\xe2\x80\x99s what called for us \xe2\x80\x9cimpact aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And this is a special funding that we do for school districts that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a large property tax base.\xc2\xa0 Again, most funding in this nation comes because of those local property tax payers.\xc2\xa0 There are two populations that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a large property tax base.\xc2\xa0 One are around military bases, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And the other is on Native American reservations.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, these are clearly both children of military families, children from the Native American community who we need to be doing more for and not less.\xc2\xa0 And the cuts to those schools in those districts come to about $60 million; and those are cuts, to be very clear, that those districts have to make now before the end of the school year.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, I was a superintendent for seven and a half years -- all of this is really difficult.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into that later.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if I was a superintendent in one of those school districts and had to make these cuts right now before the end of the school year -- what choice, what options, what good chances are we giving them?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99d do.\xc2\xa0 I think the only thing they can probably do is to cut days out of the school year.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do a call with these superintendents tomorrow to try and get a sense for how they handle it.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way to reduce your costs over the next two to three months that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Just to give you a couple of concrete examples:\xc2\xa0 Killeen in Texas -- Killeen Independent School District, home of Fort Hood -- 2,300 federally connected children; 18,000 military dependents -- they will lose about $2.6 million in impact aid funds.\xc2\xa0 Two more quick examples:\xc2\xa0 Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools in New Mexico -- 7,500 federally connected children, including 6,700 who live on Indian lands -- they will lose nearly $2 million in impact aid.\xc2\xa0 And the impact aid for them makes up 35 percent of the district\xe2\x80\x99s total budget.\xc2\xa0 Again, normally, we\xe2\x80\x99re the minority investor -- 8 to 10 percent.\xc2\xa0 In this district, we\xe2\x80\x99re 35 percent.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the dollar amount; the percent of that cut is huge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The final one I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you -- and we can give you lots of information if you want -- the Chinle Unified School District in Arizona, the cut would be about $1.2 million.\xc2\xa0 Impact aid funds make up about 61 percent of that district\xe2\x80\x99s total current expenditures.</p>\n<p>So while we\'re having this conversation about fewer teachers, fewer school days, less opportunities to go to Head Start, less ability to pay for college -- other nations, this is not how they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to improve their education system.\xc2\xa0 This is not the conversation that\'s happening with our competitors in Singapore, in South Korea, in China, in India.</p>\n<p>As the President talked about in the State of the Union, we actually want to invest much more in education.\xc2\xa0 We want a lot more children having a chance to have a high quality early childhood experience.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that we continue to drive up graduation rates, and make sure high school is relevant, and drive down dropout rates, and make sure all our young people are college and career ready.</p>\n<p>Our \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Star\xe2\x80\x9d is the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2020 goal to lead the world in college graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 And to do that, we need to make sure folks have access and that college is affordable.\xc2\xa0 So for us to be thinking about taking steps backwards in all of these areas because folks in Washington can\'t get their act together, and a level of dysfunction in Congress that it\xe2\x80\x99s just\xc2\xa0 like unimaginable to me, I can\'t tell you how troubling that is to me and, frankly, how angry it makes me feel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As a nation, we\'re starting -- the economy is coming back a little bit.\xc2\xa0 In my world, graduation rates are up a little bit.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\'re nowhere near where we need to be.\xc2\xa0 We need to be building upon that momentum, not taking a step backwards.</p>\n<p>And to do something that would have such an impact for children, for families, for schools, for communities, and ultimately for the economy, just makes no sense whatsoever.\xc2\xa0 And I just think the American people deserve something better.\xc2\xa0 Our nation\xe2\x80\x99s children, students, deserve something better.\xc2\xa0 And I just desperately hope Congress can find a way to find some common ground to compromise.</p>\n<p>I don\'t think people ever came to Washington with the idea of inflicting harm on their constituents, but that\'s exactly what might happen here.\xc2\xa0 And I just hope -- I know we\'re running out of time.\xc2\xa0 I\'m always an optimist.\xc2\xa0 I just hope they can come together and figure out a way to do the right thing, and do it with a sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>I\'ll stop there and take any questions you might have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, the impact aid cuts that you talked about, are those cuts that can be reversed if the sequester is resolved maybe not by Friday but at a later date?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I think we would be able to restore that money.\xc2\xa0 I should confirm that for you -- yes.\xc2\xa0 But again, they have to start making those cuts.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have months to -- like these other -- the other cuts we\'re talking about are for the fall, so folks can think these are cuts -- this money has to come out of their budget over the next -- in the next three months.\xc2\xa0 So I think they will start making those cuts.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I know they\xe2\x80\x99re going to start making those cuts as of next week.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the school districts suffering the impact aid -- loss of aid -- convey to you that the only real option they have is to eliminate school days?\xc2\xa0 Have you had conversations with them specifically about that?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I have not.\xc2\xa0 I\'m actually doing a conference call with all of them tomorrow, so I can come back with further information on that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just putting on my superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and with whatever -- three months left in the school year and you have to take out a big part of your budget, most school districts, 80 percent of their budget is people.\xc2\xa0 And again, as you guys all know this, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\'re coming at the sequester coming from flush times.\xc2\xa0 School districts have been hit really, really hard these past couple of years.</p>\n<p>We saved about 300,000 jobs through the Recovery Act, which we were very, very proud to do, obviously with the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and Congress\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xc2\xa0 But as a nation, we\'d lost about 300,000 teacher jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we netted out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So with a couple months to go, all you can do is, I think, cut salaries and cut days out.\xc2\xa0 Maybe there are more -- maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a more creative idea.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a much better sense tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I can\xe2\x80\x99t envision how you take out that percentage of your budget right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So your sense is that this is one of the cuts that could be noticed almost immediately.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It will be noticed immediately.\xc2\xa0 The others are more for the fall.\xc2\xa0 This one is going to play out over the next two to three months.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear -- the other cuts impact children and impact schools for the fall, but again, every school district, every superintendent worth their salt, every school board, they\xe2\x80\x99re making their budgets now in the spring for the fall.\xc2\xa0 So the layoff notices are beginning to roll, but there will be a lot more of that in March and April.\xc2\xa0 Class sizes, afterschool programs, the amount of instability that this is being injected to already a very, very difficult job.\xc2\xa0 And the one thing I always wanted as a superintendent, I just wanted to have predictability.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to know what my assets were and let me figure out how to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to force these leaders -- they have no choice but to start cutting people, cutting afterschool programs, cutting days out of the school year.\xc2\xa0 They have to start to put all those plans into effect now.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re planning for the fall.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like they can wait until August 31st to plan for the opening of school.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how the world works.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so it\xe2\x80\x99s important for you guys to understand the magnitude of the uncertainty that Congress has now put upon educational leaders at every level -- early childhood, K-12, higher ed -- around the country.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir, can you just talk about -- I get the big picture.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying the magnitude of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a series of bad choices.\xc2\xa0 But the Republicans continue to claim on the Hill that -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this -- that you have legal flexibility, individual Secretaries, different accounts -- PPAs or broader budget accounts, that you could move money around.\xc2\xa0 Have you consulted with your lawyers at the Education Department?\xc2\xa0 Can you flatly say that\xe2\x80\x99s not true?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 Second of all, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be very clear:\xc2\xa0 If I had that flexibility -- you guys help me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the smartest guy in the room -- but $25 billion, the huge share of our money are to two funding sources -- children who live below the poverty line and children who have special needs.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously -- so if you want me to shift, I can shift one way -- if I had the flexibility, I could shift one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no win there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no upside there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere to go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, obviously, these kids aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- the money may go away, all these kids are coming back to school this fall.\xc2\xa0 These kids aren\xe2\x80\x99t going -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have less children in poverty.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have less children with special needs.\xc2\xa0 And so to act like there\xe2\x80\x99s some magical thing that I could do or a superintendent or a principal could do.\xc2\xa0 Kids are going to get hurt.\xc2\xa0 Kids are going to get hurt.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just the reality.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, if you can help explain -- for years in Chicago and now here in Washington D.C. of overseeing the education systems, you know how to communicate to young people.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of young people and their families around this country that are confused by the fact that the President as well as the congressional leaders are not going to meet for the first time on the issue of sequester until Friday, after it\xe2\x80\x99s already gone into effect.\xc2\xa0 In your classrooms around the country, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a fight between sides, they meet in the middle of the classroom and they come to some resolution on this.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain to them the fact there is no conversation taking place face to face between these two sides until after the cuts that damage them so badly take effect?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, my sense is actually there\xe2\x80\x99s been lots of conversations back and forth -- principals, staff -- for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has laid out a plan.\xc2\xa0 And, as you guys, again, know better than I, that plan takes on some of his own interests in a pretty significant way.\xc2\xa0 And Congress I think is like parents -- you have to compromise.\xc2\xa0 You have to find common ground.\xc2\xa0 And if folks just refuse to, by definition -- any compromise, no one is going to be perfectly happy.\xc2\xa0 I negotiated union contracts -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no perfect contract.\xc2\xa0 No one is ever entirely happy, but you have to come to the middle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And my sense, my strong sense is there\xe2\x80\x99s been numerous, numerous ongoing conversations at multiple levels, but at the end of the day, if there\xe2\x80\x99s this one way to do it and there\xe2\x80\x99s not a sense that everybody has got to take on their own base a little bit to find a common ground and make some tough choices, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how this gets done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, what\xe2\x80\x99s so infuriating to me is this is not rocket science.\xc2\xa0 We should be spending our time and energy thinking about how we reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re losing a lot of children -- a lot of children back home in Chicago due to gun violence.\xc2\xa0 I want Congress thinking about those issues.\xc2\xa0 I want them thinking about how we increase graduation rates.\xc2\xa0 They could get this done in the next hour.\xc2\xa0 They could have gotten in done three months ago.\xc2\xa0 Intellectually, this is not hard.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just finding the courage.\xc2\xa0 It takes a little courage to go to the middle, to compromise, and to have both sides take on some of their base, which I think is the only way you move this forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s only so much political capital that any member of any administration has right now, do you believe that the sequester -- and if this does go through and the capital being spent to help find resolution for that -- is having a detrimental effect on your ability to find resolutions in terms of gun control and other issues that affect kids in your districts?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I think there are so many bigger -- take on reducing gun violence; take on making sure our 3- and 4-year-olds are entering kindergarten ready to be successful; take on a dropout rate that is going down but is still wildly too high; take on that we used to lead the world in college graduation rates and today we\xe2\x80\x99re like 11th, and then we wonder why jobs are going to other places.\xc2\xa0 All of these are hard, meaty, complex, substantive issues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99d like our collective brainpower, political will -- that\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99d like all of us thinking about all of these pieces.</p>\n<p>And, again, for me it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about education -- we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for our country here.\xc2\xa0 We have to educate our way to a better economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go there.\xc2\xa0 And so the fact that we are not spending time on those issues, the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m here talking to you about this silly stuff, and the fact that we may actually take a step backwards educationally at every level -- early childhood, K-12, higher ed -- is mindboggling to me.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s inconceivable to me that this might actually happen.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Zach.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, you mentioned that school districts are already issuing pink slips to teachers.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us where that\xe2\x80\x99s happening?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still early.\xc2\xa0 As most haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet, it really has to do with union notification, so most of that stuff will start to happen over the course of March and April.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple districts -- one I know of in West Virginia that has actually already issued notices, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just because they have an earlier notification date.\xc2\xa0 And to be clear, the vast majority of this is going to happen April, May, -- sorry, March and April, some into May.\xc2\xa0 And it just sort of has to do with each local district, what their notification system is.</p>\n<p>But the numbers -- we think the aggregate number of potential layoffs is as many -- again, this is early childhood and K-12 -- we think it\xe2\x80\x99s as many as 40,000 people will lose jobs.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the only other way you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, again, I think is you would reduce school days.\xc2\xa0 You could go to three-day weeks or four.\xc2\xa0 Again, you have people and time -- those are your only variable factors, and unfortunately, everything else is gone.\xc2\xa0 So, still early, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, unfortunately, across the country a steady drumbeat of these notifications going out, which folks have a legal obligation to do.\xc2\xa0 And the exception to that, again, would be these impact aid districts where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to start to do something next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re confident that teachers are already getting pink slips, as you said?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know of -- yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a district where it\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s just because they have an earlier union notification than most -- so Kanawha County in West Virginia.\xc2\xa0 But the vast majority of them will be rolling out over the next two months.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Secretary go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 And then, sorry, quickly -- in that district, to be clear, it\xe2\x80\x99s Title I teachers and Head Start teachers.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s these funding sources that are going to get cut.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s all sequester related, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 But these are teachers who are getting pink slips now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, the issue of bullying has gotten attention of the administration in the past few years.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you could talk about how the sequester would impact those efforts.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So, again, as a broader -- I just think we need a lot more time, we need more afterschool programs, we need more extracurriculars, we need more resources.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s so ironic -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not even having that conversation today, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about going in the opposite direction.\xc2\xa0 So creating safe communities, creating climates in which children live free of fear, thinking about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in the curriculum, afterschool clubs -- all the things we should be doing whether it\xe2\x80\x99s around reducing bullying, or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s around the arts or robotics, or whatever it might be, we\xe2\x80\x99re not even having that conversation, which is, again, crazy to me.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the world that most of these folks are living in right now.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no upside.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no upside.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get these guys out to hear the President speak.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little time for some more questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to the AP -- Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is the fact that this meeting with lawmakers and the President -- the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s happening on Friday basically a concession that the sequester is going to take effect?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you are aware that the President spoke with leaders last week.\xc2\xa0 I think he may have had a conversation with them up on the Hill earlier -- just a little while ago, prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at the Rose Parks statue dedication -- a brief one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the same ones that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to on Friday?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 This is not a meeting, but he is obviously up there with those leaders and it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding he had a brief conversation with them in anticipation of the meeting Friday.\xc2\xa0 The President did invite the four leaders to the White House for Friday, where he hopes that they will have a constructive discussion about doing something to prevent sequestration from causing the kinds of impacts that Secretary Duncan just described to you.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, as I think Secretary Duncan said, and I and others have said, compromise here in Washington can usually be measured by a willingness of one leader to put forward proposals that demonstrate tough choices by his side, or her side.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we have not seen from the Republicans is anything like the willingness to compromise inherent in the proposals that the President has put forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked at length about the President\xe2\x80\x99s offer to Speaker Boehner and how it includes not just additional revenues through tax reform -- revenues that are achieved in the same way Speaker Boehner said he would achieve them -- but spending cuts through entitlement reform, including the so-called superlative CPI and other measures.\xc2\xa0 That demonstrates tough choices.\xc2\xa0 It demonstrates a willingness to compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen, when we hear Republican leaders adamantly refuse to consider revenue as part of deficit reduction, is anything like that same spirit of compromise or seriousness of purpose that I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen demonstrated by the President and Democratic leaders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I just want to be clear, we\xe2\x80\x99re now talking about ways to prevent the sequester from having sort of the broad effects that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about through Secretary Duncan and others, not talking about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about how we buy down the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 --\xc2\xa0 ways to prevent it from going into effect at all, though?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, the Senate will vote on proposals, or at least one proposal, that would eliminate -- or rather postpone the deadline for the sequester -- a balanced proposal that the President supports; a balanced proposal that a majority of the Senate will support.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, a proposal that, while earning a majority vote, is likely to be blocked by Republican leaders, who will thereby be making the choice that we should let the sequester go into effect rather than ask that some special interest tax breaks be eliminated; that we should have these kids who are affected by the program Secretary Duncan discussed, the ones that -- military family kids and children on Native American reservations -- that they will be suffering because of this decision that Republicans will make, a minority in the Senate -- a decision they will make to block a majority-supported resolution that would avert the sequester in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, that won\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass, but certainly based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republican leaders thus far, that is a more likely outcome.</p>\n<p>But as I said yesterday, we remain hopeful that at some point, hopefully soon, that Republicans will understand the need to compromise here, and that compromise has balance at its essence.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Republicans -- a majority of Republicans in the country say they want.\xc2\xa0 So the President looks forward to a conversation, when he has this meeting, that is constructive and that includes suggestions by leaders about how we can move forward towards the kind of balanced deficit reduction that this is all about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When the sequester was passed into law with overwhelming votes by Republicans, back in the summer of 2011, the idea was that it would never become policy because Congress would be forced and compelled to compromise, to come up with $1.2 trillion in additional deficit reduction -- not spending cuts alone -- in additional deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And from the day that passed, the President has been talking about the need for balance in our deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 That has been his approach all along.\xc2\xa0 It has been an approach that he discussed about in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 It is an approach that the American people support.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the best economic approach for all the reasons that I think you heard Secretary Duncan speak about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was curious, earlier this week, in advance of these cuts, ICE announced that it released a number of detainees across the country to get ready for sequestration.\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware of this release?\xc2\xa0 And are you confident that not one of these detainees is a threat to his or her community?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This was a decision made by career officials at ICE, without any input from the White House, as a result of fiscal uncertainty over the continuing resolution, as well as possible sequester.\xc2\xa0 As ICE made clear yesterday, the agency released these low-risk, non-criminal detainees under a less expensive form of monitoring to ensure detention levels stayed within ICE\xe2\x80\x99s overall budget.\xc2\xa0 All of these individuals remain in removal proceedings.\xc2\xa0 Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety.\xc2\xa0 This step affected a few hundred detainees, as you know, out of the over 30,000 currently in ICE detention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting what Secretary Napolitano said the other day, which is that we have made enormous progress in securing our border.\xc2\xa0 We have doubled the presence of border security agents along the Southwest border since 2004, and many, including Republicans in Congress, have noted the progress that has been made.</p>\n<p>Much as Secretary Duncan discussed here, instead of talking about taking a step backward in our efforts to improve education in America -- since we have made progress in those efforts -- we should be talking about moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to border security, I think Secretary Napolitano made clear that we should be building on the progress we\'ve made, but unfortunately, we\'re talking about sequestration and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that this might be necessary as part of sequestration.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think she talked very explicitly about the direct --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About releasing detainees?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, about the direct impact that the budget conflicts that we have here with Congress and sequestration, as well as the upcoming continuing resolution expiration, that they have on her budget and other budgets, and the decisions that have to be made because of that.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you for details on these specific decisions to ICE, because this was a decision made by career officials at ICE.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and you said without --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without any input from the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let me just ask you -- as you mentioned and ICE mentioned, it says in their statement that many of these detainees are in the process of removal proceedings.\xc2\xa0 How are you supposed to bring them back in if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been released?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think you\'re misunderstanding what ICE has said.\xc2\xa0 They continue in the program under a less expensive form of monitoring to ensure that detention levels, actual detentions, stay within ICE\xe2\x80\x99s overall budget.\xc2\xa0 But they remain in the process for deportation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that some of them might not be brought back in?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would refer you to ICE.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think this is a conversation that I can help you with in the specifics.</p>\n<p>I think I said Steve next.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, are you expecting any movement at this Friday meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we hope that Republican leaders will begin to respond to the will of the American people, that they will begin to respond to some of the concerns expressed by some members of Congress in the Republican Party about the folly that allowing sequestration go into effect would represent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in Norfolk, Virginia, or Newport News, Virginia, or in some of the districts that Secretary Duncan discussed, or on the Southwest border, the impacts of sequester will be onerous and severe.\xc2\xa0 That was, after all, the purpose of designing this piece of legislation, because the sheer nature of sequester, the fact that it was so onerous, or supposed to be, for both sides was supposed to compel Congress to come together and compromise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not sensing any movement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we remain hopeful that congressional leaders, Republicans will understand the need to come together and support balance.\xc2\xa0 Again, the choice that Republicans would be making if they don\'t agree to that is a choice between up to 750,000 people losing their jobs, on the one hand, and asking that some special interest tax loopholes be closed on the other.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s a choice that seems like a hard one to most Americans.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, it seems like a difficult one for Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jay, secondly, is the United States preparing to offer direct military assistance to the Syrian rebels, or any sort of assistance at all, as Secretary Kerry prepares to meet with the Syrian opposition?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we are constantly reviewing the nature of the assistance we provide to both the Syrian people in the form of humanitarian assistance and to the Syrian opposition in the form of non-lethal assistance, which, as you know, we have provided.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is committed to helping accelerate a political transition in Syria to a democratic and inclusive post-Assad government that protects the rights of all its citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are focusing our efforts on helping the opposition become stronger, more cohesive, and more organized.\xc2\xa0 As part of this effort, we will continue to analyze every feasible option that would accelerate a political transition to a post-Assad Syria.</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry, as you know, will be participating in a Friends of the Syrian People ministerial meeting in Rome tomorrow, and he will discuss with the Syrian Opposition Coalition leaders how the United States and our international partners can do more to help the Syrian people achieve this transition.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden conveyed this to Coalition President al-Khatib when they spoke earlier this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We will continue to provide assistance to the Syrian people, to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to increase our assistance in the effort to bring about a post-Assad Syria and a better path forward for the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when did the President reach out to the congressional leaders to request this meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe yesterday or the day before.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure.\xc2\xa0 Probably yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that McConnell today has put out a statement looking forward to the meeting, saying that the one thing Americans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace spending reductions we already agreed to, just let me ask you:\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance of an agreement with the Republicans if they stick to this insistence of absolutely no tax increases?\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance of an agreement on those terms?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no alternative in the President\'s mind to balance, because what you are asking and what Senator McConnell is saying is that senior citizens, middle-class Americans, parents trying to send their kids to college, parents trying to care for disabled children should bear all the burden of continued deficit reduction while the wealthiest individuals and large corporations who enjoy tax breaks that nobody else gets are held harmless.\xc2\xa0 That is an unacceptable choice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And where Senator McConnell I think has it wrong is his analysis of what the American people want -- because poll after poll after poll make clear that a vast majority of the American people believe that we need to go about this in a balanced way; that everybody ought to pay their fair share, everybody ought to carry a portion of the burden so that no sector of society is unduly burdened by the effort, which should be an effort that we engage in together to reduce our deficit in a responsible way that allows the economy to grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think the data on this is overwhelming, so perhaps Senator McConnell might want to check it out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be perfectly clear, unless the Republicans compromise on taxes, there is no undoing these cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re right that it is absolutely clear that we cannot compromise with Republicans if Republicans refuse to compromise.\xc2\xa0 There is no question.\xc2\xa0 We remain hopeful, however, that not because the President says it should be this way or that Democratic leaders say it should be this way, but because the American people are insisting that it be this way -- the Republicans come around to the notion that further deficit reduction can and must be achieved in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve done that thus far.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\'t been pretty.\xc2\xa0 It\'s often been harrowing, unnecessarily so, through a series of manufactured crises.</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is the President has signed into law $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 More than two-thirds of that has come in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 We have now the lowest level of discretionary spending, nondefense discretionary spending, in our budget as we\'ve seen since Dwight Eisenhower was President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has put forward -- President Obama has put forward in an offer to Speaker Boehner additional deficit reduction that would bring us beyond the goal of $4 trillion that includes further balance, but also has that balance tilted significantly in favor of spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 His proposal also includes tough choices for Democrats on the issue of entitlement savings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s the kind of compromise the American people expect their leaders to embrace -- not the \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cno way am I changing my position even though the American people are widely against it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s on the approach that we think people expect.</p>\n<p>Last question -- Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just explain to the American public what might seem to them a bizarre scheduling sequence here?\xc2\xa0 That the meeting occurs after the sequester begins.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not before.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The sequester begins I believe midnight on the 1st of March.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it happens after.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually it happens before, because it happens midnight --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the meeting happens after these things begin.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 It begins midnight, March 1st -- so the meeting happens before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 11:59 p.m. Friday night?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Hill says it happens at 12:01 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday going into Friday.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is it happens at midnight on Friday, 11:59 p.m.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, it\'s very close, if it\'s not before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with leaders last week.\xc2\xa0 And there have been discussions with --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it sounds like this is not a negotiation.\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking Republicans to come here to surrender.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We\'re asking Republicans to compromise in the same way that the President has compromised, Major.\xc2\xa0 As I just said, what represents compromise by Democrats?\xc2\xa0 A willingness to go along with spending cuts that they don\'t necessarily want to see, a willingness to go along with entitlement reforms that they don\'t necessarily prefer?\xc2\xa0 I think the answer you would have to that is yes.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the answer that we all recognize here is a reality in Washington.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President has put forward.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward budget deficit reduction proposals that represent significantly greater deficit reduction through spending cuts and entitlement savings than through revenues.\xc2\xa0 But he insists on balance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not today instead of Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President will be meeting with them Friday.\xc2\xa0 He spoke with them last week.\xc2\xa0 He spoke with them today on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has still yet to vote -- hopefully, will vote tomorrow on a proposal that achieves the kind of postponement of the sequester deadline that would allow Congress to move forward on balanced deficit reduction in a sensible, no drama fashion that would avoid these unnecessary impacts across the economy and the country.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, Republicans will change their minds about filibustering that, they will allow a majority of the Senate to pass a bill that would achieve that delay in a balanced way, move it to the House and perhaps -- again, hope springs eternal -- the Speaker of the House would allow that to come to a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because I think there\'s a very good chance that there\'s a majority in the House of Representatives that would support a simple proposition, which is that we can postpone the deadline for the sequester in a balanced way just as Congress did in bipartisan fashion just two months ago.\xc2\xa0 Why not do that, and then let Congress go about the business of working on further deficit reduction?\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope they do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, how long was the meeting today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a very brief meeting.\xc2\xa0 They just talked behind -- before the event.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was only seven minutes from when he got there to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it was a very -- a short meeting.\xc2\xa0 They were all together and, as you would expect, they had a short discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the administration reach something on the Prop 8 case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on that.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:53 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
