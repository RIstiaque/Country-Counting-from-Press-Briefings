<h1>Press Briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 8/11/2010</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>See below for clarification to questions (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.<br/>\n<br/>\n* This meeting was focused on the drawdown and change of mission at the end of the month. Of course there is the context of our Security Agreement with the Iraqis, but this was not a focus of the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n** Since the beginning of this year, the U.S. and Iraqi military partnership has resulted in the death or arrest of more than 30 members of the top leadership of al-Qai\xe2\x80\x99da in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That includes the killing of al-Qai\xe2\x80\x99da\'s two top leaders this Spring. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** No. The transition force will carry out focused missions of advise/assist; supporting CT operations; and force protection, and per our Security Agreement with the Iraqi government, all US troops are scheduled to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1:40 P.M. EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am going to apologize in advance for my voice. It is not my Barry White imitation, but it is still a little on the scratchy side.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me give you a quick readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting this morning with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 They met today, as you know, to discuss Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President heard directly from General Odierno who said that we\'re on target to complete our drawdown by the end of August.\xc2\xa0 Already we\'ve removed over 80,000 troops from Iraq since President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral Odierno also reported that the security situation has retained the significant improvements made over the last couple of years and that Iraqi security forces are fully prepared to be in the lead when we end our combat mission later this month.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe President also received an update from Vice President Biden and Ambassador Hill on our efforts to support Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders as they form a new government and to transition to civilian lead within Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat meeting was this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMs. Loven.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, is there anything that you all can envision, anything that came up in the meeting that could change that August 31st date for ending combat operations?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that one of the things that General Odierno told the President and others in the meeting was that the level of violence observed over the past two weeks had been among the lowest in number of incidents that the coalition has seen since record-keeping on those incidences began.\xc2\xa0 I\'d say, obviously, that is a positive development.\xc2\xa0 We continue to anticipate as we get closer to the 31st of August a traditional uptick of violence around Ramadan and as those that are left try to gain attention.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI would say the President also got, as I said, an update on government formation. I think you probably are aware of meetings that have happened over the past couple of days with Kurdish leader Barzani and Prime Minister Maliki.\xc2\xa0 They had a press conference very recently to discuss efforts at making progress to form a government.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the President was satisfied with the progress that we continue to see on the security side; got an update and continue to pursue progress on a formation of a government -- understanding the last one took six months, we understood this was not going to be a quick process.\xc2\xa0 But we are on target by the end of the month to end our combat mission, turn over bases that Americans have been on to the Iraqis, and transition our role there.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no turning back, no matter what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing was brought up with the President that would necessitate us needing to turn back.\xc2\xa0 And I would say this. The security situation -- security forces in Iraq were in the lead on Election Day.\xc2\xa0 They provided that security. So we have seen tremendous progress.\xc2\xa0 and obviously one of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do in Afghanistan is to build a similar capacity with both police and a national army.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on another topic, what do you think the consequences should be of the comments that you made about this \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional left\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The consequences?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything in mind?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No supper.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One House member suggested resignation, so I\xe2\x80\x99m asking what you think your view is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on leaving, so -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s no truth to the rumor that I\xe2\x80\x99ve added an inflatable exit to my office.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hard to transition from that -- (laughter) -- but a question on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned about signs from data today that the Chinese economy is slowing?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that has the risk of affecting the U.S. in making the economic situation here even worse?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Jeff, I think that -- and the President will talk later today in signing an important piece of legislation on manufacturing to help companies here at home.\xc2\xa0 I think without a doubt we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen data, and the President continues to get letters from people all over the country that continue to feel the pain of the economic recession that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in for more than two years. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that in April, events that -- events in Europe began to play a role in where we are now.\xc2\xa0 We have some things that clearly have to be done to continue to make progress on our economic front.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt that if you look back to where we were a year ago, we were discussing the depth of economic -- the depth of job loss.\xc2\xa0 Now, we are seeing positive job gains -- not enough for the President, and I doubt enough for -- certainly not enough for those that continue to be out of work.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, the House came back and passed a very important proposal, particularly to ensure that 160,000 plus teachers didn\'t get fired as a result of bad state budgets.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that when the Senate comes back they\xe2\x80\x99ll quickly take up a small business bill that will increase the amount of credit that small businesses will have access to and cut taxes -- cut capital gains tax on small businesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly monitoring what\xe2\x80\x99s going on throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so and understanding that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some ways to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve often, just as you did now, been happy to highlight the fact that Europe is part of the problem that\'s affecting the United States right now. I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if China is now getting closer to --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the events in -- I don\'t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s highlighting as much as understanding the effect that we -- in living in a vast global economy, that our economy or economies throughout the world are\xc2\xa0 -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not immune to slowdowns that might start in other parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the trajectory of where we were in April is different than where we are right now.\xc2\xa0 And certainly Europe was one of the first signs of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last follow-up to that -- do you have a time frame at all for a replacement for Christy Romer?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Christy, obviously, will continue to serve, I believe through September 3rd.\xc2\xa0 I do not have a timeline on a replacement for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following on Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s question, I mean do you regret any of what you said to The Hill?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say I think there are many times when I read the transcripts even of answers I give in here that I could have done -- could have said things slightly differently.\xc2\xa0 I will say I watch a lot of cable TV, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to watch long to get frustrated by some of what is said, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what that answer has borne out. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s still substance to what you said, not necessarily -- maybe not in the way you said it, but that there is too much of a demand or too much pressure perhaps from the left of the party and that -- <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say there was too much of a demand.\xc2\xa0 I think -- or too much pressure.\xc2\xa0 I think that a lot of what -- a lot of the issues that Democrats throughout the party have worked to see happen have come to fruition as part of what this President has accomplished in the first 17 months. <br/>\n<br/>\nHealth care was an issue that was worked on for a hundred years.\xc2\xa0 President after President after President discussed the importance of passing something comprehensive and historic that cut how much we were paying for health care, that extended the life, as we saw last week, of the Medicare trust fund.\xc2\xa0 I think those are accomplishments that we all should be proud of regardless of whether it encompasses a hundred percent of what we had wanted in the beginning.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the rest that is outstanding -- gay rights, Guantanamo --\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- all things that the President made commitments on and is focused on doing.\xc2\xa0 We have a process underway with the Pentagon to make changes, as the President outlined in the campaign and, quite frankly, even before the campaign, in \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d as somebody running for the U.S. Senate in 2004.\xc2\xa0 We have a process to make good on overturning \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to progressives who on reading your comments yesterday say, well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s their attitude, I\xe2\x80\x99m staying home in November?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they will, because I think what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in November is too important to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in November, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President outline throughout trips -- on trips throughout this country, are exactly the choices that we face in November.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to go back to the economic policies that got us into this mess, or are we going to go forward and see the type of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s any -- you look at the -- today the President had a meeting, probably, what, two, two and a half weeks before ending our combat mission in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That was a significant part of -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it as much, but I think we all remember we spent almost all of 2007 and a hefty part of 2008 debating our role in Iraq almost exclusively.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you reached out to anyone in the Democratic Party to explain your comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the government formation aspect of the briefing that the President got today, you talked about how everyone expected that it would take some time, but did the President express any frustration at the pace?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the last government took nearly six months to form.\xc2\xa0 The President is encouraged that we see signs of progress.\xc2\xa0 And I think as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re moving toward that eventual setup and making progress in doing that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll feel good about the direction we\xe2\x80\x99re heading. Obviously we want that to happen as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 As August 31st comes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant transition on our part that the Iraqis will now be more responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The $20 billion BP fund, I know that -- I believe $3 billion has already been put into that.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline or some sort of payment plan to fully fund that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the escrow documents -- the escrow agreement calls for -- called for $5 billion before the end of this year, $5 billion in each year in 2011, 2012 and 2013, for a total of $20 billion.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline that was agreed to during the meetings in the Roosevelt Room.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that Ken Feinberg has said that next week he will release documentation around the protocols for individual compensation claims to the trust fund.\xc2\xa0 And I know there have been requests for, and we will make public the documentation -- the escrow trust documents.\xc2\xa0 There was some question about that. We talked to counsel and DOJ today, and I anticipate putting that out in the next hour or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, were there any doubts expressed today about the 2011 deadline?\xc2\xa0 Was there a discussion about the do-ability of that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I was not in the whole meeting.\xc2\xa0 I can check and see whether there was any discussion of the SOFA agreement or not.*<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a long piece in The New York Times today about how -- with some people expressing the opinion that it\xe2\x80\x99s just impossible.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be troops on the ground after 2011 -- border security, weapons training, a lot of different missions that simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be done by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, it would be premature to get into a discussion about -- obviously, as we speak, there is a SOFA agreement.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of anything and ahead of government formation.\xc2\xa0 I think there is without a doubt a change in our mission in Iraq, who is in the lead in Iraq, the progress that has been made from a security aspect.\xc2\xa0 And what we hope and what was always envisioned is that the security gains would lead to political gains, and that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to see in the formation of a new government.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see something happen on August -- is there going to be something different on August -- on September 1st, compared to August 31st, or is this just kind of an arbitrary date as we move into --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I think we should be clear, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an arbitrary date because there will be 80,000 fewer troops from when the President took office in that country, on that day.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there will be a transition ceremony.\xc2\xa0 There will be a new mission, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new commanding general, and the Iraqis will fully be in the lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve transitioned -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved out -- I forget the exact number -- on the order of 2 million of equipment have been moved out of Iraq; as I said, 80,000 troops; bases have been turned over, and there will be a new mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional left,\xe2\x80\x9d there are some people out there who believe you\xe2\x80\x99re smarter than you\xe2\x80\x99re admitting, and that this actually was a calculated -- (laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One of those is my mom.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This actually was a calculated, premeditated effort to send a message to the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional left.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did you misstep?\xc2\xa0 Did you put your foot in your mouth, or did you say something that you meant?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I have both my feet planted firmly on the floor, and nothing in my mouth to speak of.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your esteemed substitute yesterday that you answered -- said that you answered honestly.\xc2\xa0 Was this an honest, correct answer that you have to those questions when you --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would not contradict my able substitute.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this was an honest answer?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not backing away from it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that -- I think many of you all have heard frustration voiced in here and around, sure. I don\'t -- I doubt I said anything that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mistake?\xc2\xa0 It was not something you said in error?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was borne out of frustration, but I don\'t think it was -- again, I think it was borne out of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you stand by it?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s private frustration that you expressed publicly and accurately?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, public frustration that was written down publicly.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want to name any names?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I left my membership list back in the office.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of the professional left?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, who wants to eliminate the Pentagon? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that was -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that a proposal during the presidential campaign?\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t Dennis Kucinich -- or maybe it was adding the Department of Peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Department of Peace --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between adding a Department of Peace and eliminating the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people today are trying to step back from this, some of the liberal bloggers and such, and say, okay, the White House does deserve some credit for things, but part of the problem is that when they don\'t go as far as we\xe2\x80\x99d like them to go, they don\'t reach out to us; they don\'t pat us on the back and say, hey, we tried, there\xe2\x80\x99s no communication.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there is a lack of communication with what you call the professional left\xe2\x80\x99s -- <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- lack of outreach from this White House?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that criticism today.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously there are a number of people in the White House in public engagement and political affairs and other places that spend a lot of time communicating.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt -- I doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s a time in which everybody feels completely satisfied at the level of communication and we would always strive to do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- let\xe2\x80\x99s put some of what the Democratic Party is doing into some real context.\xc2\xa0 I think yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s vote in Colorado was a pretty good example of the type of coalition that the President put together in 2008 and that the President helped -- through his endorsements and appearances -- helped a candidate in Michael Bennet, that he believes is the best voice to represent Colorado in the Senate -- somebody with a long track record on education reform, a long track record -- or a track record in the Senate of pushing for needed congressional and ethics reforms.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 60 percent of -- these are figures as of midday yesterday -- 60 percent of the electorate in the Democratic primary had either not voted in or voted in only one past Democratic primary.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important obviously part of the coalition that the President put together in 2008 to get new voters that wanted to see change to the polls.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You told Dan that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached out to anybody on the -- in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional left,\xe2\x80\x9d so you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you owe anybody an apology?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to anybody outside of the building other than normal friends that I talk to each and every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to the President about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about this, no. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comments about Keith Olbermann\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial comment\xe2\x80\x9d last night?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you I was watching my BlackBerry for primary returns and watching the Braves game on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of your \xe2\x80\x9908 coalition, Dennis Kucinich says you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten the role that progressives played in that and his own personal role, he says, in passing health care reform.\xc2\xa0 Are you not giving liberals, the left side of the party, enough credit?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For being a significant part of the coalition.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember having any comment on that at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The measure the House passed yesterday to help teachers retain their jobs calls for an eventual cut in food stamps.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be the impact of that? And that\xe2\x80\x99s brought on some criticism from progressives as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that is not -- that is -- the Recovery Act changed food stamps through 2018. The redirection of that money only accounts for years 2014 through 2017.\xc2\xa0 So the measures that were passed as a part of the Recovery Act for the foreseeable future are left intact for those that need help.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s thinking that the help won\xe2\x80\x99t be needed by --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think also that help -- rather than money programmed for 2017, given the fact that here we sit in early August with 160,000-plus teachers facing a layoff, that redirecting that money made more sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just talked a minute ago about how the early part of the campaign was a lot about the war in Iraq, and the President was pretty critical of the surge.\xc2\xa0 Does the President now think the surge worked and was a good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would give you the answer that I think the President gave standing both in and near Iraq in 2008, that the surge was intended to do two things -- it was intended to augment the security environment so that we could change the political environment.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the bravery and heroism of our troops and those additions added to impacting that security environment. What we wanted to see more of is a change in the political environment. And we are making progress toward establishing -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had another election -- establishing a new government and enabling us to change our mission in Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was that improved security environment provided --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As the President said it would when it happened, yes, the adding X number -- X thousand number of troops is likely to improve the security environment.\xc2\xa0 But again, the security environment alone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to change our mission in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we have a stability in a political system now and making progress toward a new government that does allow us to meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment of transitioning our combat role.\xc2\xa0 That was tremendously important.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess just bottom line, do you think he does think it worked in the sense that perhaps under his own tenure, because the security environment was improved, he was able to bring about these changes?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the security improved as we all believed that it would.\xc2\xa0 It has taken longer to see the correlating political gains, but we\xe2\x80\x99re far enough along now in some of those political gains that we can transition that role.\xc2\xa0 I think the role that Vice President Biden and others have played in changing that political environment has been tremendously important to the overall cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Lest we not forget that it was Iraqi leaders in 2008 that said -- they also not just in the SOFA, but there was discussion obviously by Prime Minister Maliki about a timetable for transition that was enormously similar to that proposed by then-candidate Obama.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems like you guys are pointing to Iraq and this drawdown and this date as a success, and I wondered if you give any credit to former President Bush and the surge as contributing to what you guys regard as a success.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that, as Democrats and Republicans said, we would have security gains -- that as we talked about throughout the campaign and I think were criticized for, a military role alone was not going to change our mission in Iraq, because if you have security gains but not the responsibility of a functioning government to take the responsibility of both providing the security and executing its civilian duties, it would be hard to transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned at all that you will not get proper credit, if you will, for what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq, given the situation in Afghanistan?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- I will say -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many people will either decide to or decide not to give different entities credit.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, I look back at a lot of time that I spent in 2007 and 2008 in a fairly vociferous debate about our role there.\xc2\xa0 I think it is safe to say that even as the President pledged during that campaign, at the beginning of this administration, and even on the day that he traveled to North Carolina to give that speech, there were a lot of people that said it was not -- the date that we\xe2\x80\x99d outlined, the end of August of 2010, was simply not doable.\xc2\xa0 It not only is doable, we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to do it.\xc2\xa0 In 20 or so days, that mission transitions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you look at the sheer number of troops that are deployed between right now and when the President took office, even with the additional troops in Afghanistan, I think by a little more than 30,000 -- by a number of a little more than 30,000, there are fewer troops deployed overseas.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the American people understand and appreciate that accomplishment, what you just described?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do think that, because we do know so many years later the amount of sacrifice that was made on behalf of our men and women in the military, some paying the ultimate price.\xc2\xa0 I harken back to -- remember when I forget who the advisor was who said it might cost $150 billion in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure we\xe2\x80\x99re multitudes beyond $150 billion.\xc2\xa0 We have a -- we\xe2\x80\x99re ending a commitment that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re ending a combat commitment there and transitioning our role in a way that will help our military and will help our treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is there a contingency that if conditions in Iraq turn sour that the U.S. role, military role, could resume a combat role there after August 31st?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, Mark, that I think it is always safe to say that the military has plans drawn up for a 1,001 different scenarios.\xc2\xa0 Again, the report that the President got, though, was clear in the progress that was being made.\xc2\xa0 The level of violence at a rate over the course of the past two weeks, as General Odierno said, which was among the lowest that had been recorded since they had kept records on this may all of -- has made the transition possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On August 31st, do we end up with 50,000 U.S. troops?\xc2\xa0 Is that what the number is?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the approximate number, yes.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the approximate number.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, have you heard the President offer a view on the exceedingly bad press the First Lady got about her trip to Spain?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoger.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\'d like to go back to the economy again.\xc2\xa0 The markets are down between 2 and 3 percent worldwide today -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know that -- largely brought on by the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s action yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re out with a survey of 67 economists saying the GDP for the U.S. for the last -- for the six months of this year, the last half of this year, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be only 2.55 percent, which is really an economy sort of treading water.\xc2\xa0 Is there any -- number one, do you have any comment on that?\xc2\xa0 And second, has the President asked Mr. Summers or Ms. Romer to take a look at is there anything else we can do?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roger, I want to not get into commenting on Fed actions, obviously.\xc2\xa0 The President met with and talked through some scenarios today with Dr. Summers on what we were seeing worldwide -- in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And I think he will continue to talk to the team about any efforts that they think are necessary to ensure that we continue positive job growth, that we see positive economic growth.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long ago where the debate was the depth of that job loss, the depth of that economic retraction.\xc2\xa0 I know that a great number of meetings and discussions were held on the legislation that the House passed and the President signed late yesterday.\xc2\xa0 If you think about both the short-term economic impacts of 160,000 teachers losing their job, the long-term impacts of 160,000 classrooms without a teacher, the impact that that has on educating a workforce that we need for the jobs of tomorrow, it\xe2\x80\x99s why the President wanted and why he appreciates the actions of the House and the Senate so much in making it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, I mentioned earlier, the President wants to see progress on a small business bill, on cutting taxes and on increasing credit.\xc2\xa0 And certainly they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to talk about whatever steps those in the White House or others deem might be necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if these economists are right and the economy only grows 2.6 percent in the last half of this year, that\'s not good as it compares with the 3.1 percent in the Mid-Session Review that was just out last month.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as I said earlier, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that the trajectory of where we were in April is somewhat different than we are today.\xc2\xa0 Our goal is to continue that positive action.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this a bunch -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my favorite graph, but nobody here believed that the depths of what we were entering into was going to be easy to get out of, because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have just one problem, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t just have a collapse in the financial industry, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t just have -- which led to tightening of credit.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t just have a huge housing crisis.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t just have 8 million jobs lost.\xc2\xa0 You had all that at one time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take quite a bit of time to move out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we are at a point where instead of discussing where we are on the downward trend of that hole, where we are on an upswing -- not satisfied, the President and the team not satisfied with all of what they see.\xc2\xa0 Obviously different sectors are going to do better than others and we have to keep working at whatever is necessary to continue to get the economy growing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow -- who did he meet with this morning?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a sense of what they -- <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we were going into a meeting, Dr. Summers was coming out of the Oval.\xc2\xa0 But best I can tell -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who else was in that meeting with the President and Dr. Summers.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the President\xe2\x80\x99s export initiatives that exports actually fell in June?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say obviously there are monthly numbers that will bounce around -- increases in imports, decreases in exports.\xc2\xa0 We still have the same goals.\xc2\xa0 I think today\xe2\x80\x99s event on manufacturing furthers those goals.\xc2\xa0 And I do point out that the year-to-year change in exports is up 18 percent.\xc2\xa0 So while there will be some monthly bouncing around, our commitment and our goal of doubling exports remains a huge priority, because, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, world economic growth can\xe2\x80\x99t hinge entirely on United States demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have good products that we want to sell overseas.\xc2\xa0 The President -- just last week at an auto plant outside of Chicago that makes the Explorer that will be exported to 90 countries. Those are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s tremendously important.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In setting these deadlines, there was some concern that al Qaeda in Iraq or other insurgent groups would just wait out.\xc2\xa0 I know SOFA sets out deadlines, but this August 31, 2010, deadline was the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 Was there any conversation this morning about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place? Any sense of that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why this is --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get somebody to get a longer answer on that.\xc2\xa0 There was some discussion and has been over the past few days of just the, quite honestly, the severe degradation of al Qaeda in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in meetings where that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed in terms of General Odierno\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we are -- we see a different security environment on the ground than we saw just a few years ago, particularly as it relates to al Qaeda insurgents there.**<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other.\xc2\xa0 That roughly 50,000 there will be there at the end of this month -- is there a drawdown schedule, or is there conversations around one for the next --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that but I can check on the phasing of that.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSheryl.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 On the Panama City trip coming up, can you talk to us about what the President and his family plan to do over the weekend?\xc2\xa0 And why only one night?\xc2\xa0 Some questions came up yesterday about the short duration of their stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Sheryl, let me -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information on their schedule.\xc2\xa0 Some of it will be -- some of the events that he will do will be treated as OTRs. Secretary Mabus will be going to the region with the President, and I think when they arrive the President will meet with business and tourism leaders to discuss the impacts that they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on their business because of the oil spill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe President will meet with those folks and have a chance to update, I think, the region on where we are both from a relief well standpoint -- obviously the weather has -- the weather will likely delay the relief well completion by two to three days, but we anticipate that the work will continue again over the weekend. And I think it will be important for the President to talk about what are the next steps in bringing the region back. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip is to highlight that -- obviously many of you know this because you traveled there during the summer, I grew up not too far from there -- tourism is the economic issue -- those hotels along the beaches, the businesses that they support.\xc2\xa0 And because of the spill -- even in places where oil didn\'t necessarily wash ashore have, because of the environment around the spill, seen a huge contraction in their own business.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was something that the governor of Florida specifically talked to the President, and to the First Lady about when she was down.\xc2\xa0 And they both believed that it was important to highlight that, indeed, the Gulf Coast is, during a busy summer, open for business and the families that are there are enjoying their time there. Even as the President talks about what our next steps are in our response, obviously part of this will be highlighting the tremendous economic toll that has taken place -- as I said, even on places that didn\'t necessarily see a large amount of oil wash up, are still very much open for business.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like much of a vacation for him if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be meeting with business leaders and --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sheryl, I think --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be -- is his family going to be doing social --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the pool in either Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard or Hawaii, I think you could attest to the fact that the notion of a presidential vacation is one Sit Room call away from becoming a -- I just heard a lot of groans -- they watched their Hawaii trips disappear.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see his family doing sort of more recreational activities --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll see he and the family out there.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll see all of them out there. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can we also talk a little bit about Colorado?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us, did the President watch the returns last night?\xc2\xa0 Does he draw any broader message from Michael Bennet\xe2\x80\x99s victory and his own involvement --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 The President called Senator Bennet not long after the race was called.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously had traveled out there to help Senator Bennet gain support, raise money.\xc2\xa0 The President was proud to lend his name\xc2\xa0 -- I think appeared over the course of the last week, in \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out The Vote\xe2\x80\x9d mailings, television ads.\xc2\xa0 The President participated in Senator Bennet\xe2\x80\x99s tele-town hall.\xc2\xa0 I gave you those figures earlier about what comprised voter turnout in the Democratic primary, in seeing first-time and nearly first-time voters come back out again to participate in an important primary.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take away from the results of last night -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in Colorado, in Connecticut, or in Georgia, in some cases gubernatorial races, in some cases gubernatorial and Senate races -- to think that the Democratic Party as a whole didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a very good night.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at -- Senator Bennet will now go up against somebody who believes that Social Security is bad policy and that we should do away with our involvement in a student loan program that allows thousands to send their kids to college without having to pay exorbitant interest rates.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a debate that will turn out quite well for us in November.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also was non-committal about -- when asked if he would want the President to campaign for him through the general election.\xc2\xa0 He was non-committal about that.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think our involvement in that race, whether on the television out there, or in the mailboxes out there, or in the news out there, is fairly well documented. We were -- again, I think Senator Bennet has -- he\xe2\x80\x99s a first-time political candidate.\xc2\xa0 His substantive professional experience was superintendent of a Denver school system that saw an enormous amount of reforms that he can proud of.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be an enormously strong candidate in the fall. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that Democrats should feel better about the prospects in 2010 and what the impact of the economy will be two, three months from now?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously our hope is to try to get the economy turned around not just in two or three months, but tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I think the outcome of last night\xe2\x80\x99s elections in the states that those primaries were had, were nothing but good news for the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hard pressed to think of a race where -- last night -- where we didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up in good position either with who won or in good position with who the eventual Democratic nominee will face in a general election. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could I ask you real quickly, if tomorrow the Senate does come back and pass that immigration -- the $600 million for the border security, is that it for the year for immigration?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else President Obama thinks can be done?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President on any number of occasions discuss the importance of dealing comprehensively with immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That was the bedrock of the suit that the Justice Department filed in Arizona. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take 60 votes to get something through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It takes 60 votes to get the nominee at an agency you\xe2\x80\x99ve previously never heard of through the Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a yes, nothing else this year? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s up to -- that is up to Republicans about whether -- Republicans are going to have to ask themselves do they want to roll up their sleeves and be leaders on a very tough issue, or do they want to play politics?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is fascinating to watch the strict constructionists and those that have great fidelity to our Constitution want to tamper with the very amendment that provides -- that has provided for 150 years equal protection under the law and a due process.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve the very hard issue of immigration reform. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how we should solve immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Only by comprehensively addressing border security, the workplace, those that are here -- only by doing that comprehensively are we going to make progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the people on the Gulf are asking will the President go in the water. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will let that dangle until sometime over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 We all know that it\xe2\x80\x99s hot enough that the one place you want to be most quickly is -- having spent some time in Panama City -- is in the water. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 The seven Baha\xe2\x80\x99i leaders who have been imprisoned for the last two years have just been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that, but let me get something from NSC on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you. <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Did the President encourage the First Lady to go out on the campaign trail during this midterm season?\xc2\xa0 And what message might the First Lady offer in her travels?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t want to get ahead of announcements on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard others and I know David Axelrod said it, and I anticipate that at some point she will likely make some appearances.\xc2\xa0 She is -- she\xe2\x80\x99s a mom and has to focus on the importance of raising two children, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get into that closer to the political season.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has launched a pretty good push on education, talking up his education reforms.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why now and if this has anything to do with the midterms?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President has spent a lot of time talking about education.\xc2\xa0 It has not -- sometimes when there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of back-and-forth, sometimes when there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of resistance and debate, an issue like that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get as much attention.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the investments that the Recovery Act made in things like Race to the Top, I think reforms that have been instituted to take banks out of the role that they traditionally had played in student loans, are all extremely important achievements for this administration.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will likely continue to talk about them, particularly as families get closer to sending their children back to school for the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nApril.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the economy and something else.\xc2\xa0 The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities says 44 states are addressing 2011 budget shortfalls.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s next after this jobs bill?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, the next thing that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the Senate complete -- the House has voted on this and the bill lies with the Senate, and that is a small business bill, a bill that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, cuts capital gains taxes for small businesses, allows them to deduct a greater amount of their investments, and opens up the lines of credit through community banks that they need to expand.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about that, and that\'s the thing that the President will talk about as the Senate comes back.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Included in the Recovery Act was an increase in funding for food stamps, for the food stamp recipients.\xc2\xa0 And food stamps were pretty much cut to fund the teacher jobs and --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this again.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I forget who exactly asked the question -- the Recovery Act extended that through 2018.\xc2\xa0 The reprogramming took place for the latter four years because the belief was that instead of programming money for 2017 when you have 160,000 teachers that are about to be given pink slips, that at the time-being, that was the more urgent need.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there going to be any kind of recalibration?\xc2\xa0 Is the administration going to go back -- because there are advocacy groups for many of those who are on food stamps saying this is just not fair, there is a need, and it was put in place originally because there was a need.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think -- we understand that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it was in the original bill.\xc2\xa0 I think redirecting money from 2017 to 2010 we believe addressed the most urgent need that states and localities faced at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what did you say to the President about your faux pas or your misspeak --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made note to you by email that he knows about it or anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t emailed about it either.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another economic issue, the tax cut extensions for the top 2 percent, the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 desire not to extend those.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress -- I guess both chambers do these votes before the November election.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to get an update on that.\xc2\xa0 Do you still feel that that\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to go?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any concern that it could backfire either if the Democrats lose the votes within their own caucus to split the difference that way or --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- go ahead, finish your question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I have to say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on allowing the tax cuts for those that make more than $250,000 is splitting the difference.\xc2\xa0 The President has supported middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 The bedrock of the Recovery Act was a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans. What the President has not and never supported is tax cuts for wealthy, upper-end income earners. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean split the difference on what you want.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you a tactical question. Do you still think that pushing this before November is the right way for Democrats to go?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any concern it will backfire?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any update on the timing of how --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any update on the timing.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s probably a question better directed to the Hill.\xc2\xa0 I will say, Margaret, that this is obviously going to be a part of the debate over the course of the next 80 days.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a vote or not, this is going to be hotly debated. I don\'t -- you had a series of tax cuts that were designed to take on varying levels, depending on what taxes were cut, and then December 31, 2010, they drop off a cliff.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that\'s not how the President would have designed the tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a debate that I think will be a big part of the 2010 election, particularly as it relates to -- I mean, look, that was the centerpiece of the economic policies of the previous eight years. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the White House wants not just a debate but a vote before the election?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can double-check particularly with Legislative Affairs and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\'t know of any clarity on that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would point you to the House and the Senate in terms of the scheduling.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- question about Chip\xe2\x80\x99s earlier question, not on the \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional left\xe2\x80\x9d but on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Did I understand you to say that with regard to pulling out the remaining 50,000 troops that will be there under a sort of different purpose after August 31st, that that is an issue that exists as long as the SOFA says so, but it\xe2\x80\x99s theoretically possible that that could change?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the hypothetical of what\xe2\x80\x99s next. Obviously the agreement that has been signed by the two governments is a status of forces agreement that ends all American personnel by the end of 2011.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was this discussed today during today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the President -- you know, if things take a really bad turn after August 31st, what the mechanism is for sort of a U.N.-turn or a slowdown or anything like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said to Mark, look, there are -- suffice to say the Pentagon has plans for a lot. That\'s their job.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re military planners.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President did not hear from those on the ground -- both on the diplomatic side and on the security and military side -- did not hear anything that would lead him to believe that any of those plans would ultimately be necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are contingency plans that always get discussed that you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know the degree to which those were talked about today.\xc2\xa0 My guess is not a lot, simply because the update on the situation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily -- again, the situation is such that we see no impediment to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the 31st and going forward, starting September the 1st.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, there are on any number of occasions in any number of places in the world very, very detailed contingency plans for a lot of different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Going forward, what is the U.S. involvement politically in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Because I think a lot of people, especially in the Middle East, were kind of holding on a lot of hope for the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement last week as far as what the U.S. will do for the political situation, which has reached a pretty significant stalemate now between Allawi and Maliki. So how much of that was discussed in the meeting today?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President remains actively involved in the continuing talks about forming a new government.\xc2\xa0 We had staff in the region not too long ago that -- meeting directly with the parties to try to continue to get progress along the road to setting up a new government.\xc2\xa0 We will remain active in them.\xc2\xa0 The military role transitions to one led by civilians, and the formation of a new government in Iraq remains a significant priority for our government.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this was discussed in the meeting today?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Vice President Biden specifically provided the President with an update.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, I think you can see developments in the region that are positive, meetings that are happening between the parties that are ultimately necessary for what\xe2\x80\x99s going to need to happen to form a government. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are no deadlines or anything set up?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No deadline timelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no discussion of such?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President in the past has been a very vocal supporter of net neutrality. There\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal by Google and Verizon that would allow for prioritization of Internet content over wireless networks and also for building sort of premium Internet services on top of the public Internet.\xc2\xa0 Does the President and the White House have a view on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some information on that for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSam.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Iraq, I wonder if you can -- throughout the debates on the Iraq war, Republicans, with some notable exceptions, have asked for -- have called for victory in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have after August 31st?\xc2\xa0 Will it be -- did we win?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are transitioning from -- to a new mission.\xc2\xa0 I think that by any account there is still progress to be made in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President will celebrate the role and, as I talked about earlier, the effort and the heroism that our men and women in uniform -- the role that they played and the role that they contributed in bringing about stability to that country.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I will say this, Sam. I don\'t think -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a formation of government that has to take place.\xc2\xa0 The next government will have challenges as it relates to services that any government of a country provides.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s still progress that has to be made.\xc2\xa0 I think we can -- we, though, can celebrate the transitioning of responsibility to the Iraqis. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back -- sorry -- going back to your comments on Ken Buck\xe2\x80\x99s win, I want to expand it out a little bit.\xc2\xa0 In the Georgia Republican gubernatorial primary, the winner in that race, Representative Deal, has actually dabbled in birther conspiracies.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is an avowed birther, but he certainly has pushed the notion that the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born in this country.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you -- upon reflection, what do you think of the fact that the Republican Party has put forth someone to run a state who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the President\xe2\x80\x99s birthplace?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you look at what Nathan Deal is probably going to have to explain over the course of this primary, that might be some of the least of his concerns -- in terms of some ethics investigations that are currently ongoing.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI think having -- the last I checked, the results in that race were within a few thousand votes, which means even as you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to find a nominee, you have a very divided party, with somebody in Roy Barnes who has a track record that Georgians can be proud of.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Handel conceded.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But you still have a very splintered party.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you are hard-pressed to see, whether it is gubernatorial races in Georgia, Connecticut, Denver -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Colorado -- and Senate races in Connecticut and Colorado, where Democrats didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an extraordinarily good night and are faced with I think, quite frankly, candidates that are largely out of step with the states and areas that they wish to ultimately represent.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s question, in your view and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, is Iraq a success story?\xc2\xa0 Can you view what the U.S. has done in Iraq -- now having a reliable ally in the region -- as being a success in terms of U.S. foreign policy?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- as I enumerated in Sam\xe2\x80\x99s question, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s progress that the Iraqis leading and being responsible for their own country now are going to have to make.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that what has never been in doubt is -- and the President said this in announcing his opposition to the war in 2002 -- we all support our troops.\xc2\xa0 We all recognize the tremendous sacrifice that they and their families and all of their loved ones make when a Commander-in-Chief, regardless of who that is, makes the decision to deploy them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a role that the President toward the end of the month will celebrate -- again, even as Iraqis turn to governing their country, providing exclusively for its security, warding off potential insurgents, and ultimately making progress in their own quality of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nEND<br/>\n2:41 P.M.
