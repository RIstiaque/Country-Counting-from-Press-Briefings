EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the questions.\xc2\xa0 Kevin, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you talk a little bit about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of how the ceasefire is working in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been closely monitoring reports since the ceasefire went into effect on Friday afternoon Washington time.\xc2\xa0 Since that time, we\xe2\x80\x99re aware that there have been some reports of violations, some concerns that have been raised that is consistent with our expectations heading into this process, which is that we did anticipate that there would be reports of violations and that we would encounter some potholes on the road to implementing this successfully.\xc2\xa0 And fortunately, there is a process in place for members of the international group responsible for monitoring the cessation of hostilities to examine these reports.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we remain committed to this process for two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is that successfully implementing a cessation of hostilities -- actually, there are three reasons.\xc2\xa0 The first reason would be that it can allow for a more sustained and successful effort to deliver humanitarian relief supplies to communities inside of Syria that have been suffering for a long time.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people, innocent people, who were caught in the crossfire and not able to get the basic sustenance that they need.\xc2\xa0 So being able to move food, water and medical supplies into some of those communities is critically important and could save lives.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second thing is it will serve to reinforce the need for all of the parties to focus on the most important goal, and that is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the concern that we have had is that some of the actors, particularly the Russians, have been distracted by and focused on the political opponents of the Assad regime, and not on the extremist and terrorist organizations like ISIL that are trying to use the political chaos in Syria to establish a safe haven.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third thing is that we are hopeful that successfully implementing a cessation of hostilities would at least add a little momentum to the ongoing effort to reach a political solution to the situation inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to require even further sustained diplomatic efforts, but it could -- and is necessary, in fact -- to ultimately address the problems inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful of, but that\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to closely monitor the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say yet where the responsibility lies, or most of the responsibility lies for the violations that have occurred so far?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say that.\xc2\xa0 At this point, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these reports and they are being investigated consistent with the process that\xe2\x80\x99s been established before the cessation of hostilities went into effect.\xc2\xa0 So there is a method, a mechanism for reviewing these reports and assessing whether or not everyone who signed on to this understanding is acting consistent with their obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ayesha.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So moving on to North Korea, there is a University of Virginia student who I guess has been taken into custody by the government, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s admitted to kind of severe crimes and propaganda and all these things.\xc2\xa0 And so I was just wondering, is the White House looking into this issue of this American that\xe2\x80\x99s being held in North Korea?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the news conference and we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of this particular situation and have been for almost a couple of months now.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, there\xe2\x80\x99s no greater priority for the administration than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad.\xc2\xa0 And in cases where U.S. citizens are reportedly detained in North Korea, we work closely with the Swedish embassy, which serves as the United States protecting power in North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re working through the Swedes to learn as much as we can about this individual and about the circumstances of his detention, and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in ensuring for the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about Apple.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to be on the Hill, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that, once again, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the court order that would force them to open up the San Bernardino shooter\xe2\x80\x99s phones, that this would open up a liability or a privacy issue for many iPhone users, and that this is going to -- or that this could set a very dangerous precedent.\xc2\xa0 And you said time and time again that this is more of an isolated thing, that this is not some back door that the Justice Department is trying to get into the iPhone.\xc2\xa0 So I guess, do you have any kind of response to that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re making this case that this is a dangerous precedent, that this is something that could really be harmful to the privacy of, I guess, millions of iPhone users.\xc2\xa0 And the administration is kind of going against that.\xc2\xa0 So I guess, can you talk anything about this case that they\xe2\x80\x99re making?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been clear from the beginning -- because this discussion has arisen around one specific court filing and one very important investigation.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, our policy in this instance is focused on this particular device.\xc2\xa0 This is a device that was used by a terrorist.\xc2\xa0 That terrorist is no longer living.\xc2\xa0 The device itself was used by the terrorist but is actually owned by the local government there, and the Department of Justice has made a case to a judge, as they should, that obtaining as much information as possible about what\xe2\x80\x99s in that phone is important to their investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted independently.\xc2\xa0 These are federal prosecutors and officials at the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that are conducting this investigation.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to determine what they believe is necessary, and what they believe is most important in this circumstance to ensure that their investigators have access to the necessary information to keep the American people safe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear, just as a general matter, that this investigation is a priority to him, and that he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important to our national security for our investigators to learn as much as possible about the individuals who carried out this terrorist attack, to try to understand who they may have communicated with, and make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re taking all the steps that are necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 That is related to this one isolated investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore broadly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about what our policy is, and our policy is actually pretty straightforward and I think consistent with what most Americans think.\xc2\xa0 The policy is simply that the American people and our economy benefit from robust encryption.\xc2\xa0 And we do need to make sure that we are protecting the privacy and civil liberties of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s an important priority as the leader of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, there are some common-sense things that we can do to prevent terrorists and others who want to do harm to innocent Americans from using cyberspace as a safe haven.\xc2\xa0 And I think even when you talk to people in the -- leaders in the technology industry, they understand that they created these tools to benefit from the kind of open society that we all enjoy, and that that includes great opportunities for improving people\xe2\x80\x99s quality of life.\xc2\xa0 It certainly includes opportunity to make money and to capitalize on an information economy.\xc2\xa0 All those are good things.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of things that make the United States the envy of the world.\xc2\xa0 They certainly are the kinds of things that people move to this country with the hopes of enjoying.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also why the United States continues to be at the forefront of innovation around the world, because of our ability to use these kind of technologies to improve lives around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are all good things.\xc2\xa0 And I would acknowledge that there is some tension in those two principles, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes this hard.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no confusion about the position of the administration and how that reflects basic common sense in terms of protecting privacy, protecting the kinds of freedoms that allow an industry like this to thrive, while at the same time protecting our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, two different questions.\xc2\xa0 I want to go to the GOP and issues of race in their candidates.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a broader issue than politics at play.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel a President of the United States -- do you have the luxury to select and choose what group or what culture or what race or what type of people you want to support, or be President over?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if you\xe2\x80\x99re elected President of the United States, you have a responsibility to lead the whole country.\xc2\xa0 The President has made this observation on a number of occasions -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s not just the President of the people who voted for him; he\xe2\x80\x99s also President of the people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote and President of the people who supported someone else.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, the President feels a deep responsibility to look out for the interests of everybody in this country.\xc2\xa0 And certainly President Obama has conducted his presidency in that way, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the way that previous Presidents have approached their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, individual candidates that are running to replace President Obama will have to make their own case about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s part of their philosophy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say about the RNC really trying to change the face and the look of the Republican Party in distancing themselves from some of the comments and some of the antics during the primaries when it comes to separation versus unity?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the RNC to make their own decisions about how they want to run their party\xe2\x80\x99s elections.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s another party, but this is a bigger issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a division, about race.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how divides have caused anger and have caused a groundswell that really people don\xe2\x80\x99t want.\xc2\xa0 And people say it\xe2\x80\x99s a heart issue versus a legislative issue, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a heart issue going on.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment for the RNC?\xc2\xa0 I mean, whether it be work on this, or they need to stop -- what?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment for the RNC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, then.\xc2\xa0 So the next question, the next topic -- voter ID.\xc2\xa0 On Super Tuesday, there are about five states that are going to have some problems with photo ID issues, and it could also hurt the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about that and your thoughts about the problems that these states are expecting to encounter?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to anticipate what may happen.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on this, though, is something that he has discussed on a number of occasions --\xc2\xa0 I think most recently in a speech that he delivered in Springfield just a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 In that speech, the President talked about how, in his mind, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for the government taking steps and putting in place laws that make it harder for people to exercise their right to vote.\xc2\xa0 If anything, we should be trying to make that more convenient for eligible voters to cast a ballot and have it counted.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of our democratic process, and the President has expressed his disappointment that Republicans have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to think of creative ways to make it harder for people to vote.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the spirit of our democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is going to continue to make the case that when it comes to protecting people\xe2\x80\x99s right to vote, that is actually something that should rise above our narrow political partisan considerations.\xc2\xa0 That should be the kind of thing that, as a country, we should be able to rally around, which is encouraging people to be engaged in the business of governing the country and encouraging them to take the time to cast a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, the President, after the last election in 2012, formed a taskforce that was actually headed up by the President\xe2\x80\x99s election lawyer and Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s election lawyer.\xc2\xa0 And they put together a whole set of recommendations that would essentially make it easier for eligible voters, citizens, to cast a ballot.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s some local jurisdictions that have consulted those recommendations and tried to implement them, but truly there is more that can and should be done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that this is a foreshadowing of things to come, because in the last presidential election you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have this, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s increasing even more?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that there is going to be more efforts to be able to change this to go back to what it was, or do you think this is a foreshadowing of things to come and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to increase?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to cast forward that far.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s views, as a policy matter, are that the government should actually be making it easier for eligible citizens to cast a ballot.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You said that the President would likely be looking at materials for Supreme Court nominees this past weekend.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update for us on either timing?\xc2\xa0 Or has he narrowed his list -- anything?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates in terms of the process.\xc2\xa0 The President has continued to review materials that were compiled by his team.\xc2\xa0 We are not at a place yet where the list has been closed, so the President is not reviewing a final list at this point.\xc2\xa0 But look, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard for me, as we move forward here, to provide a whole lot of detail about this process while it\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the President continues to take seriously his responsibility to consult with Congress, and the President is looking forward to the meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have tomorrow with Leader McConnell and Leader Reid, and Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Leahy to discuss his appointment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And any more updates on that meeting?\xc2\xa0 Because, as you know, Senator McConnell and Grassley have different views about what this meeting maybe should be about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, initially, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Grassley had different views about whether or not to participate in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the President takes quite seriously the responsibility that any President has to consult with Congress when making a nomination that\xe2\x80\x99s this important.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 The stakes are quite high.\xc2\xa0 And the Constitution is quite clear about how we should proceed.\xc2\xa0 The Constitution says that the President shall nominate someone to the Supreme Court, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the constitutional responsibility that the President has embraced and will fulfill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So going into Super Tuesday, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw the latest poll numbers this morning, but they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty surprising for Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in one of the questions, it was about 50 percent of college-educated Republicans support Trump.\xc2\xa0 So the administration must feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s at least a good chance that he is the Republican nominee, yes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that certainly seems to be what all of you are reporting.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight beyond that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But looking at the numbers alone, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s huge.\xc2\xa0 He has a double-digit lead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think he even might use that word to describe it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where I got it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, there are a lot of votes that are still to be cast.\xc2\xa0 And Super Tuesday is tomorrow; there are 11 or 12 states that are up.\xc2\xa0 And we are entering a stage in the campaign where there will be a significant number of states and a significant number of voters in those states that will be casting ballots.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true not just on Tuesday, but I know that into the weekend and the next couple of weeks, that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But those numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t impress you very much?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think those numbers -- I think voters all across the country will have a lot more to say about this, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what their opinions are.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the President had a lot to say about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s prospects when he was in California, and he said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Trump would be President because, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, America\xe2\x80\x99s better judgment would prevail, or something to that effect.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- does the administration still believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, that he will not be President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That continues to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, great.\xc2\xa0 And also, you know, last week we heard from the Vice President while he was in Mexico, saying that he almost feels that he needs to apologize for the rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s been out there.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel the same way about that?\xc2\xa0 When he travels or when he meets with foreign leaders, does he almost feel like he needs to apologize for somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do think it is just about -- I think by just about any standard, the kind of rhetoric that we have seen from Republican candidates -- and not just the frontrunner, but from all of the Republican candidates -- has not been consistent with the kinds of values that this country has long cherished.\xc2\xa0 And it is those values that other countries admire.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of values that allow the United States to continue to be so influential around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you see prominent politicians running down those values, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact on our standing in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interests here in this country, Democrat or Republican.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why not just this President, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many Americans come forward and express in some cases, concern, in some cases, alarm, over the rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s being employed by Republican presidential candidates right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, the other thing we should be mindful of is that other countries do follow our elections.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of rhetoric does have an impact.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, individuals should choose to run the campaign that they believe best reflects their vision and their priorities, and that certainly is their right to do it.\xc2\xa0 But there are consequences for it too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s already had an impact on our standing in the world?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that rhetoric has been out there for a pretty long time now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what is true is that, based on the way that President Obama has chosen to use our influence around the world, our standing has been enhanced and our interests have been advanced based on that strategy.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways to measure this -- whether it is building an international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, or uniting the world to confront Iran over their nuclear program and sealing a diplomatic agreement that will prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, or, even just as we saw at the end of last week, working effectively with the Chinese and other members of the United Nations Security Council to put forward the most robust sanctions that have ever been put in place against North Korea in response to some of their destabilizing activities there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that is an indication that President Obama has succeeded in enhancing our standing in the world.\xc2\xa0 It has made America safer.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that some of the rhetoric that we see from the other side does have the potential of rolling back some of that progress.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, why Brian Deese in charge of the process for the SCOTUS?\xc2\xa0 This is not something that he would generally run.\xc2\xa0 Just a question about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has relied on Brian in a variety of critical situations to do important work and to take on important projects.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple that come to mind.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, very early in the administration, Brian played a key role in the auto taskforce that engineered the recovery and rescue of the American auto industry.\xc2\xa0 Those were tough decisions that the President had to make early on.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of good options, but he relied on the advice of Brian and other members of economic team to put in place a strategy that has laid the groundwork for not just the recovery and revitalization of the American auto industry, but of the historic health and performance and strength of the American auto industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another example is, Brian, for most of last year, was focused on trying to move across the finish line a climate agreement in Paris.\xc2\xa0 And that was an agreement that was successfully negotiated and completed at the end of last year. \xc2\xa0And a lot of that is a testament to Brian\xe2\x80\x99s hard work; obviously, he was part of a much broader team, including people earlier in the administration who had worked on this.\xc2\xa0 But Brian certainly deserves a lot of credit.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of moving that over the finish line, Brian played a key role here in the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So taking on this substantial responsibility when it comes to the Supreme Court, where Brian will be organizing a broader process that will include other key members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team -- including the President\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, Neil Eggleston -- that, given Brian\xe2\x80\x99s performance in those other priorities, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly surprising that he would be tapped for this responsibility too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little more insight into that process at all, where you are precisely now?\xc2\xa0 Obviously we want the short list.\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten to the short list?\xc2\xa0 Just anything at all on that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot more on the process today.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President did spend a significant period of time over the weekend reviewing materials and considering potential candidates.\xc2\xa0 Based on the last update that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received, the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not working with a closed list at this point.\xc2\xa0 There could still be people added to the list for consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But look, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve also acknowledged before -- that previous Supreme Court vacancies have taken about 30 days or so to fill -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of what our timeframe -- the timing expectations are with this vacancy.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the President will do his due diligence and spend some time thoughtfully considering who the best person is to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend plenty of time talking to members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans about this decision.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also spend some time talking to people outside of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that we can give you some insight into who those kinds of people are, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you say 30 days, you mean his own process, not to fill the vacancy including Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 It typically took about 30 days for the administration to put forward a nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to make the case against Donald Trump in the campaign if Mr. Trump ends up being the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 As Michelle has pointed out, the polls indicate that that is very much the likely outcome.\xc2\xa0 What would the President say in making the case against Donald Trump?\xc2\xa0 Are you all putting together a sort of list of things for him, kind of a book about Trump?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on in that process?\xc2\xa0 And what would the President say when he makes that case?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no internal process that\xe2\x80\x99s related to the potential Republican presidential candidates.\xc2\xa0 Look, at this point, there are still a lot of voters in the Republican Party that haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision yet about who they will -- who they believe should lead their party in the next presidential election.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve made their decision, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t formalized that decision in casting their ballot.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, the Republican voters will decide who they believe best should represent their party.\xc2\xa0 I think what is true is that there is some consternation in Republican circles, at least in Washington, D.C., about the strength of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0 And the suggestion has been that he is on the brink of succeeding and hijacking the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the truth is, when you have party leadership in Washington, D.C. that is blocking important work that needs to get done, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly challenging for the views of the party and its candidates to be a little unclear.\xc2\xa0 We see Republican leaders in Congress who spent years campaigning to try to get the majority of both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Now they have that majority and they\xe2\x80\x99re in a position where they\xe2\x80\x99re not just saying no, they\xe2\x80\x99re not saying anything.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to speak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just not that Republicans are opposed to that, they\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to even engage the administration, despite the fact that we have put forward a plan on the time frame that they laid out, despite the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually the Secretary of Defense who put together that plan and put together that set of recommendations.\xc2\xa0 And you have a leading senator being filmed -- filming himself, basically, crumpling up that piece of paper and throwing it in the trash can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a party that is trying to advance our national security and stands for something?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a party that\xe2\x80\x99s refusing to do their job?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The same is true when it comes to a whole range of nominations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked at some length about Adam Szubin.\xc2\xa0 This is a financial expert that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a particularly political job, but he does have an important responsibility, which is to put in place sanctions that will be focused on North Korea, on Russia, on Hezbollah, on other national security adversaries of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And you have Republicans in the Senate who say that he\xe2\x80\x99s qualified by refuse to give him a vote, refuse to even move him through the committee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that a Republican majority in Congress refusing to do their job is on the brink of being taken over by someone that they say doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent their views.\xc2\xa0 When you don\xe2\x80\x99t stand for anything, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall for anything -- or, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t stand for anything, you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall for anything -- or however that expression goes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Somebody Google it for me -- because it seems particularly apt in this situation.\xc2\xa0 That appears to be what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to Republicans right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following on this question a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Has the President actually had any conversations with any potential candidates, even if the short list isn\xe2\x80\x99t finalized yet?\xc2\xa0 Has he begun to reach out on the phone, or conducted any interviews in person with anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s potentially under consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If he has had those kinds of conversations, they\xe2\x80\x99re not the kind of thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss prior to announcing formally a nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, following on Michelle and April\xe2\x80\x99s questions -- over the weekend, David Duke, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK, he expressed support for Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism in the aftermath of that that Donald Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak out forcefully enough against the support.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Do they think that the Republican frontrunner should take a more public pronounced stance on that?\xc2\xa0 Or does the President believe that this is just Donald Trump representing his own values, like you said just earlier, not necessarily with --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, it will be up to Mr. Trump to decide how he wants to run his campaign and what he wants to say in terms of the kind of support that he\xe2\x80\x99s recruiting to his campaign.\xc2\xa0 And it will be up to Republican voters across the country to decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with those tactics.\xc2\xa0 I think my observation is simply that Mr. Trump says that there is more that he needs to learn about Mr. Duke before he can render an opinion, but I think we now know all we need to know about Mr. Trump to render our own personal opinion of his candidacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said in December that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Donald Trump was qualified for the presidency based on his position banning Muslims, foreign Muslims, from entering the country.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that, based on the full product that Donald Trump has presented so far to the American people, that he\xe2\x80\x99s a racist?\xc2\xa0 Or does the President believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s a racist?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, the people are going to have to decide for themselves.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sort of take their own measure of Mr. Trump and his rhetoric and the kinds of values that he champions on the stump.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to evaluate who his supporters are, and the extent to which he is coordinating with his supporters.\xc2\xa0 But that will be up to the American people to decide.\xc2\xa0 And as Michelle noted, the President has previously expressed his confidence in the ability of the American people to make those kinds of decisions.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have elections.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we have debates.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we have campaigns.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the strength of our democracy that we give our citizens a responsibility that\xe2\x80\x99s that significant.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we know what time this meeting is going to happen tomorrow about the Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time in front of me, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know, and there will be some press access to the meeting so you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to see all of them gather.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last week, Leader McConnell made a statement essentially saying that his purpose for this meeting is to come and tell the President why you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do anything with a nominee.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And what does the President expect to accomplish out of this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that there are a number of things that we could discuss in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things the President is interested in discussing is actually what happened in 1988.\xc2\xa0 That was the last time that a President of the United States was calling on the United States Congress to vote for his nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And it seems to me the President is actually meeting with the right group of people, because he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with two Republicans who supported that nominee, who voted \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d the last time that there was a congressional vote to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in a presidential election year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will also be sitting next to the person who served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time -- that was Vice President Biden.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s notable because Vice President Biden was the chairman of the committee because Democrats were in charge of the Congress, a Republican was in charge of the White House.\xc2\xa0 So you had Democrats who were acting in a presidential election year to confirm a Republican nominee to the Court.\xc2\xa0 And that vote was held in a presidential election year.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no arguing that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Everybody knows that, they all know that.\xc2\xa0 Everybody in the room is going to know all that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, again, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sort of discuss exactly how Congress is going to handle something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arisen in, what is it, 28 years now, then maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the right group of people that are at the table.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some headlines about the fact that Justice Thomas apparently today asked a question during oral arguments for the first time in a decade.\xc2\xa0 It was a domestic violence case that involved the Second Amendment, gun rights.\xc2\xa0 Your reaction to the fact that -- not sort of the minutiae of the case, but the fact that he asked a question?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reporting around that.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that there will be an intense dissection of the words that he offered today.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point about what it may mean about his views on that particular case or whether or not he is approaching his job different now that his close friend, Justice Scalia, is no longer on the court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You anticipated my next question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, look, at some point he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss that publicly.\xc2\xa0 But obviously he is somebody who has thought a lot about what he believes is the best way for him to express his opinions on the Court, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s signing on to specific opinions or participating actively in the questioning.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the way that he has chosen to pursue his responsibilities, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t second guess those.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President, as a constitutional lawyer, ever expressed an opinion about the fact that there had been this long period of time when he has not asked a question?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the President talking about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have an opinion about it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you ask him?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe one of you will have an opportunity to do that at some point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, over the weekend there was a really horrific shooting incident involving a police officer in Prince William County.\xc2\xa0 A 28-year-old woman who was on her first day of the job.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to her family at all, or the department out there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, obviously we saw the news over the weekend and it\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking that an individual who is a reservist in the United States Marine Corps was demonstrating her commitment to public service and she was doing the kind of thing that we see hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officials do every single day, which is she put on the uniform, prepared to put her life on the line to protect her community.\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, it was the very first time she put on that uniform that she paid the ultimate sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s tragic, particularly when you see how young she was and how much promise her career had.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with her family and with the law enforcement agency that she worked for.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to tell you right now about any presidential communication, but I would anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I ask because obviously the President has had a lot to say about gun violence in this country and he has faced some criticism from law enforcement about not being even-handed about it, which is why I asked would he -- would you expect that he might call, or why would he not call the department, the family of the officer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about that right now, but I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch one way or another.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I do think that this underscores -- once again, you heard the President on Friday in Jacksonville talk about the impact that gun violence is having in far too many communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 Ironically, the President was actually talking about a different mass shooting incident.\xc2\xa0 In this case, a day later, you saw a police officer be killed in the line of duty.\xc2\xa0 And again, it is a reminder of the risks that law enforcement officials, police officers take for us on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 We owe them a debt of gratitude for that service.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a reminder, once again -- even without knowing the specific circumstances of this particular incident -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s long past time for Congress to take some common-sense steps that would reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what kinds of laws would have been required to prevent this particular incident from occurring, but if there is even one incident of violence that we can prevent, particularly if that incident of violence is against a police officer, then shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Congress take it?\xc2\xa0 It certainly seems to me that they should fulfill that responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in some cases -- this goes back to the answer that I was giving earlier -- when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Republicans in the majority in both the House and the Senate, they vowed to use that majority to get Congress moving again, to do some common-sense things, but yet they have not done any common-sense work to make our communities safer from gun violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, when you have a nominee that\xe2\x80\x99s come forward and by their description is seeking to hijack the party, it seems like you make that a lot easier when you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to do your job, even though you\xe2\x80\x99re in control of the United States Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, with this meeting tomorrow with the Senate leaders, given how contentious the conversation already is about a potential nominee, is the President trying to lower the temperature?\xc2\xa0 Is there an objective from this meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99s seeking?\xc2\xa0 Is he offering up an openness, a willingness to take on some names for potential nominees?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is open to a discussion, but it would represent a pretty dramatic reversal in position for Mr. McConnell, who has said that the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put anybody forward, to come with a list of potential nominees.\xc2\xa0 So again, when his position is that the United States Senate is not going to fulfill their constitutional responsibility, it makes it hard for him to engage constructively until they change that position.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a discussion about what the President hopes the process looks like.\xc2\xa0 But look, I think the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s true is the President is going to continue to make the case now that we\xe2\x80\x99re here in the middle of a Supreme Court term and the Supreme Court is hearing cases.\xc2\xa0 The case that the President will make is similar to the case that President Ronald Reagan made.\xc2\xa0 President Reagan in November of 1987 said, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people\xe2\x80\x99s business in that crucially important body.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So look, the position that President Obama is taking is entirely consistent with the position that was taken by President Reagan.\xc2\xa0 And when President Reagan put forward someone to fill that vacancy that he was talking about there, the Congress voted -- in a presidential election year with bipartisan support, even though Democrats were in charge -- to confirm Justice Kennedy to the Court.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re asking Republicans this time to do the same thing, and to put their constitutional responsibilities ahead of their narrow political, partisan motivations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this point, the President would believe that the Court itself is \xe2\x80\x9cimpaired,\xe2\x80\x9d to follow through on the quote you just read there, from making a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what President Reagan believed.\xc2\xa0 And the President has on a number of occasions, just in the last couple of weeks, said that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to put forward a nominee, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Constitution requires.\xc2\xa0 It says that the President shall appoint -- shall nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And then Congress needs to follow through on their responsibility to ensure that the Supreme Court can function as our Founders intended.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a pretty short meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preempt -- or prejudge what the meeting looks like.\xc2\xa0 The President is certainly committed to a serious discussion of constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see if Republicans are also committed to that kind of serious conversation.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they won\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xc2\xa0 And if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t, then maybe it will be a shorter-than-expected meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what Stephanie Cutter\xe2\x80\x99s role is going to be in this process?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are a lot of groups here in Washington, D.C. that are pretty interested in the outcome here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the Supreme Court is tasked with a set of weighty decisions before them.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that they should be fully staffed and have the full complement of Supreme Court justices when considering those important decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, outside the White House, there are a range of groups that are interested in some of these outcomes, and in order to sort of self-organize, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to work closely with Stephanie and some others to organize their efforts.\xc2\xa0 And that will also make it easier, where appropriate and where necessary, for the White House to coordinate with those outside groups.\xc2\xa0 We can do so through -- by having conversations with Stephanie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that is ultimately a role that is outside the White House.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s not a White House employee or anything like that.\xc2\xa0 She was at one time, but is not at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she\xe2\x80\x99ll be in regular communication with Brian Deese on this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about regular communication, but when necessary, yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on Syria.\xc2\xa0 France today said it was very concerned with these violations that it is seeing, and called for an emergency meeting to be held by the task force overseeing the so-called ceasefire.\xc2\xa0 You said it was still too early to tell what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Is it easier for you to tell what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the skies, given the continued Russian bombing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that we have referred to this understanding as a cessation of hostilities is that this is different than a ceasefire.\xc2\xa0 The United States and our coalition partners are continuing to take strikes against ISIL -- ISIL is not party to the cessation of hostilities -- and Russia is continuing to take strikes against groups that they claim are not party to the cessation of hostilities, either because they\xe2\x80\x99re ISIL-affiliated or they\xe2\x80\x99re affiliated with other extremist organizations that are operating inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so the question is raised about who actually their targets are.\xc2\xa0 And there is a process in place where we can work with the parties involved to evaluate exactly what the targets are and whether or not the military operations that are being conducted by the Russians are consistent with their obligations in the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place to review.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The French said they were very concerned about these reports.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. also very concerned?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly are aware of the reports, and we are interested in making sure that the process that has been established is followed for investigating them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell if the Russians are violating the cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to another international crisis, North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Do you know -- do you expect a U.N. vote on sanctions against North Korea this week?\xc2\xa0 And are the United States and China agreed on what those sanctions should be and what that sanctions bill -- vision should look like?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 U.S. and Chinese officials have been for several weeks now engaged in intensive diplomacy to put together a set of sanctions against North Korea that would require the support of the international community through the U.N. Security Council to essentially account for North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s provocative activities that are a flagrant violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the package that\xe2\x80\x99s been put together at the U.N. is a significant one, and it would significantly tighten the screws on the North Korean regime.\xc2\xa0 It would subject all cargo going in and out of the DPRK to mandatory inspection.\xc2\xa0 That would be the first time that that kind of -- that those kind of mandatory inspections would apply to all of the cargo moving in and out of the DPRK.\xc2\xa0 The package includes a prohibition on all small arms and other conventional weapons going to North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the first time, it would impose broad, sectoral economic sanctions against the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 And it would include, in some instances, even banning outright exports from North Korea of things like coal, iron, gold, titanium and other rare-earth minerals.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s just limiting the export of those products.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a significant impact on the North Korean economy and an impact on their ability to continue to fund their nuclear and missile activities that are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0 There also will be stepped-up enforcement of previously imposed sanctions against the North Koreans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a very serious package that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward, and a lot of this was the important work of U.S. and Chinese officials.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, other members of the United Nations Security Council have been involved in this process thus far and will continue to be critical to our success in getting this package passed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, the Chinese and the U.S. are agreed on the package, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Chinese speak for themselves, but this kind of package was the result of intensive diplomacy between U.S. and Chinese officials.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you anticipate a vote this week?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with Ambassador Power\xe2\x80\x99s office for the timing of a vote.\xc2\xa0 I know that at one point there had been the expectation that the vote would happen in quite short order.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s still the case; you can check with them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is Russia an impediment to a vote this week at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the Russians for their view on this particular package.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last North Korea question, I promise, from me.\xc2\xa0 The THAAD missiles, that\xe2\x80\x99s been subject to controversy between the U.S. and China, as you know.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry said the way that we would be willing not to put them there is if North Korea would abandon its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese are concerned about the range of the radar on those missiles.\xc2\xa0 Has any sort of understanding been reached regarding deployment of the THAAD missiles?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have begun discussions with our allies in South Korea about the deployment of this system that would better protect South Korea from the North Korean missile capability.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of the system and that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of our discussions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen the public concerns that have been raised by China with regard to the deployment of this system.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been crystal clear from the beginning that this deployment is not a reflection of something that\xe2\x80\x99s happening with China\xe2\x80\x99s missile program, but is a direct reaction to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing development of a ballistic missile program, and one that our North Korean -- or our South Korean allies are justifiably concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick domestic question.\xc2\xa0 We all found out today that Brian is leading the SCOTUS effort, or at least organization at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Did he start doing that today?\xc2\xa0 Or if not, when did he start that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have long expressed our concerns with the tendency of -- well, not a tendency -- a tactic employed by ISIL to slaughter religious minorities in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall at the very beginning of the military campaign against ISIL that some of the first actions that were ordered by President Obama, by the United States military, were to protect Yazidi religious minorities that were essentially cornered on Mt. Sinjar by ISIL fighters.\xc2\xa0 We took those strikes to clear a path so that those religious minorities could be rescued.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have long been concerned by the way that ISIL attempts to target religious minorities.\xc2\xa0 We also know that they target Christians in the area, too.\xc2\xa0 In that region of the world, Christians are a religious minority, and we certainly have been concerned.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the many reasons we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned with ISIL and their tactics, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s an affront to our values as a country to see people attacked, singled out or slaughtered based on their religious beliefs.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared to use the word \xe2\x80\x9cgenocide\xe2\x80\x9d yet in the situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at that point there will be a process commenced -- a much more public process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the fact that there is a private process that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing right now that the President and his team are engaged in to choose who the President believes would be the very best person to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 That process is entirely consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 After all, the Constitution says that the President shall nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 Once that nominee has been put forward, the ball will then move squarely into Congress\xe2\x80\x99s court -- no pun intended.\xc2\xa0 And Congress will them have to determine whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, this will be a choice for the Republican majority to make.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has -- our expectation is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee should receive the same consideration that the President\xe2\x80\x99s two previous Supreme Court nominees have received.\xc2\xa0 After all, the Constitution of the United States does not include an exception for presidential election years.\xc2\xa0 And in 2009 and 2010, when the President put forward nominees to the Supreme Court, they happened to be two women in those cases, but those two women were given the courtesy of private one-on-one visits with a number of United States senators.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were given timely -- they were given fair hearings that took place in public, under oath, where they were questioned by Democrats and Republicans alike.\xc2\xa0 And I would expect this time that questioning would be no less intense and serious.\xc2\xa0 But what those nominees also received were timely yes-or-no votes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd those steps were not taken as a courtesy to the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 They weren\xe2\x80\x99t a political favor that was delivered by one political party or another.\xc2\xa0 It was the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibility to do those things.\xc2\xa0 And the Senate has a constitutional responsibility to do those things in 2016, even in a presidential election year.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of process that we envision.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just note that the two previous processes in 2009 and 2010 culminated in confirmation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees.\xc2\xa0 And those confirmations included \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d votes from a number of Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And I feel confident in telling you that even though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly who the President is going to choose to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President is going to put forward somebody who he believes can serve with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court, and therefore merit bipartisan support in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I follow up on this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has been eight months since the President sent the nomination of Under Secretary Jacobson to be ambassador of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 My question to you is, has the White House been in contact with Senator Marco Rubio about his opposition to her nomination?\xc2\xa0 Or what else is the White House doing in trying to go ahead with the vote for Jacobson?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you raised another example of the kind of approach that Republicans in Congress have taken to their job, which is to not do it.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard anybody raise substantive objections to Ms. Jacobson\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation to that important job, to be the ambassador to Mexico.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has served at the State Department in a career role for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 She is an expert in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And she would do an admirable job of protecting and even advancing the important relationship between the United States and our neighbors to the south.\xc2\xa0 But yet, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans in the Senate refuse to act on that nomination, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been unfortunate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to tell you about, but certainly seeing her nomination confirmed and seeing her on the job is an important administration priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how long is the White House going to continue pushing her nomination?\xc2\xa0 Or are you looking for another candidate to be ambassador of Mexico?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the right woman for the job.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s a skilled diplomat, and is more than qualified to advance this important relationship between the United States and Mexico.\xc2\xa0 And the longer that Republicans engage in this totally unwarranted, unjustified delay, is the longer that we miss out on an opportunity of having our embassy in Mexico fully staffed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Using that example, and Szubin and some of the lower courts, is there any expectation then that the White House has that this similar gridlock will somehow miraculously be broken in the case of a Supreme Court nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans that run around and say that they believe that Supreme Court nominations are different.\xc2\xa0 And they like to say that these are even more important.\xc2\xa0 That might be an area where we have some bipartisan agreement.\xc2\xa0 That may be an area where would acknowledge that, yeah, we can have our differences of opinion over Roberta Jacobson -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that can quibble with her credentials.\xc2\xa0 But even if you want to register your objection to the U.S. government policy in the Western Hemisphere, then that\xe2\x80\x99s one tool that you have at your disposal.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not condoning it in any way.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly is one lever that Republicans can pull.\xc2\xa0 It has consequences.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in this case, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a Supreme Court justice, there is significant consequences for essentially having the Supreme Court not fully staffed.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a third branch of government that is at the risk of being blatantly politicized.\xc2\xa0 You essentially have Republicans who are coming forward and saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to support the nominee -- or not even consider a nominee put forward by this President because we want to see if our chances are better after the next election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people want to see -- the American people want to see the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s objection to that kind of politics.\xc2\xa0 I think what the American people want to see is they want to see their President, whatever party that individual serves in, put forward a nominee that is eminently well qualified and that can earn strong support in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the President is going to do.\xc2\xa0 The President intends to fulfill that responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an expectation that the American people have; it\xe2\x80\x99s also an expectation of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to fulfill it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a situation where Republicans will have to make a pretty important choice about whether or not they will fulfill their constitutional obligation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a robust conversation about it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Deese, Cutter, Eggleston -- is it fair to say that the First Lady would have an interest in having a little conversation with the President about the Supreme Court nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to get into those kinds of conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would she be a part of the group, the cadre of folks that will look at --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 She would not have any sort of formal role like that at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said no formal role.\xc2\xa0 But might she weigh in?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any conversations between husbands and wives at any level, let alone any conversations between the President and the First Lady.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, I think the First Lady obviously has on a range of issues acknowledged and respected that her husband has got an important job to do and that he\xe2\x80\x99s got a whole team of advisors here that he can rely on to offer him the very best advice as he makes important decisions.\xc2\xa0 So again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any of their conversations, but this decision will be driven by the kind of advice and material that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to him by his legal team.\xc2\xa0 And he will, based on reviewing the backgrounds and public record of those potential nominees, make a decision about who he believes is the very best person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was reported that he\xe2\x80\x99s reading some past cases, some past decisions involving some potential nominees.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond saying that the President will consider the public record and take a close look at the public record of each of the potential nominees.\xc2\xa0 And that would include, if there are judges on the list, at least taking a look at some of their public writings.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a pro-choice litmus test?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President, when talking about this before, has said that he would not have specific litmus tests.\xc2\xa0 He did lay out, in the blog that he wrote for SCOTUSblog last week, the criteria that he will use in choosing a nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier -- you said the Apple investigation is a priority for this President.\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because, Kevin, we started out talking about this as being the investigation into the terrorist incident in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that our investigators need to get to the bottom of what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 They need to get their hands on as much information as possible to determine what motivated these individuals, whether or not they were working with anyone else, either inside the United States or around the world, to carry out this attack.\xc2\xa0 If there is more that we can learn about exactly what their plans were about what may have radicalized them and inspired them, we want to know that information too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is an independent investigation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our law enforcement experts, our investigative experts on the task.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re doing the very best that they can to collect information that could be used to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is interested in compelling a company -- a private enterprise to essentially hack their own material to assist the federal government in this investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, this is a filing by the Department of Justice based on conclusions that were reached by independent law enforcement investigators.\xc2\xa0 So again, this is something that the Department of Justice is engaged in.\xc2\xa0 This is an independent investigation.\xc2\xa0 But the President has made clear that he wants to review the results of that investigation and make sure that all the steps that are necessary are being taken to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was a yes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you take a look at my answer.\xc2\xa0 I think I was pretty clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Richard.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First one on Syrian refugees.\xc2\xa0 Canada welcomed the last of the 25,000 refugees, as promised, without major problems.\xc2\xa0 Where are we in this process here in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Richard, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, the process for refugees entering the United States is a long and difficult one.\xc2\xa0 Refugees who, through the U.N. program, enter the United States are subjected to the most robust screening standards of anybody who attempts to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0 That means that they have to undergo background checks, which includes in-person interviews.\xc2\xa0 Refugees have to submit biographical and biometric information before they can be admitted to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that information is all run through a set of databases that are maintained by the Department of Defense, by the intelligence community, by law enforcement organizations both here in the United States but also international law enforcement organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Typically, that process can take 18 to 24 months before an individual is admitted to the United States through the refugee program.\xc2\xa0 So the reason for that is that our national security interests and the safety of the American public is paramount.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it also is a testament to the generosity of the American people.\xc2\xa0 Through that U.N. program, the United States takes in more resettled refugees than every other country of the world combined.\xc2\xa0 And that, again, I think is an indication that the United States can both continue to play a leading role in responding to an international crisis while at the same time protecting our national security and protecting the safety of the American public.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in this very case, how many do you think have been welcomed?\xc2\xa0 I understand the process is long and it\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous.\xc2\xa0 About 1,000, 100?\xc2\xa0 How many do we think we have?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where we are in the current process, but you can check with the State Department about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached 25,000?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not this year, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not this year.\xc2\xa0 Another question.\xc2\xa0 Last week, during the GOP debate, there was a question by one of the panelists on the border -- a wall on the border of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the ideas of the candidates -- one candidate in particular.\xc2\xa0 And they talked -- this panelist talked about how about the Canadian border, and the answer was only, well, the Canadian border is just too long to wall -- to be walled.\xc2\xa0 Is there a danger coming from the north?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Say the last part --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a danger coming from the Great White North?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what is true is that the United States and Canada have a really important national security relationship.\xc2\xa0 And our ability to share information and to cooperate to protect the citizens in both our countries ultimately is a strategy that has served our countries well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I suspect that this continued national security and counterterrorism cooperation will be the subject of some discussion when Prime Minister Trudeau visits the White House next month.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even if the border is long, it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth building a wall, considering the relationship that you described?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out a strategy for protecting the American people and the Canadian people that\xe2\x80\x99s served the citizens of our countries quite well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to the election in Iran -- results are still coming in, but it appears that President Rouhani has secured a more moderate parliament.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see that as an indication of his diplomatic engagement with this country?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to weigh in on the results of the elections because they have not been formally announced.\xc2\xa0 But we do expect that official results will be released tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 At that point, however, it will also likely be clear that there will be a number of runoffs that will need to be run.\xc2\xa0 And so I probably will not be able to offer up any specific reaction to the Iranian elections for some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can just say in general that the diplomatic agreement that was negotiated last summer to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was not predicated on a more moderate government taking power in Iran.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some make the case that that international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is actually even more important if government leaders in Iran that are hostile to the United States take power; that that\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason we need to make sure that Iran is abiding by the broad international obligations that other countries abide by.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of our view in terms of the legacy of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that just the prospect of succeeding in negotiating the agreement and completing it has created an opportunity for the United States and Iran to improve our relations.\xc2\xa0 So it was in the context of -- or at least on the sidelines of those talks where there were discussions about securing the release of U.S. citizens that were being unjustly detained inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we were able to bring those American citizens home because of those discussion.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of other arrangements that were reached that were mutually beneficial.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was a rather short-term prospect, but yet the process of successfully negotiating the agreement has allowed us to advance our interest.\xc2\xa0 But it remains to be seen over the longer term exactly what direction the Iranian people choose to pursue for their country.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve made strongly the case that even if that is a government that is hostile to the United States, it makes the international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon all the more important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two follow-up questions.\xc2\xa0 One, to the pro-choice litmus test.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court is going to be hearing one of the biggest cases argued for it on Wednesday, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a Court that\xe2\x80\x99s altered by the death of Justice Scalia.\xc2\xa0 He was the most vociferous opponent to abortion.\xc2\xa0 If you appointed or if the President nominated a pro-choice person, it would flip the makeup of the Court, so how can you say that that is not going to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I have shied quite a ways away from predicting outcomes on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on how those outcomes would be changed by a nominee that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t named yet.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is very mindful of the criteria that he will use to choose a nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested in somebody that has unquestioned legal credentials.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll want somebody who has the right kind of experience for the job.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll want somebody who is committed to the rule of law and focusing on what the law says and what precedent says, and not focusing on politics.\xc2\xa0 And in some ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the institution of the Supreme Court so unique -- is that our expectation is that regardless of whether you are appointed by a Democratic or a Republican President, that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a judge who will impartially apply the law.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the concern that I have about this process is that the unprecedented way that Republicans are injecting partisan politics into the nomination process does put that third branch of government, the Supreme Court, at risk of being exposed to far more partisanship than I think most Americans are comfortable with.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the concern. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, every nominee that a President has put forward since 1875 has gotten either a hearing or a vote, unless of course that President withdrew that nominee.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the degree to which the Republican tactic here is so unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And it is all motivated by partisanship.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a disappointment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that at some point, enough Republicans will come forward in the United States Senate and say, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to allow our constitutional obligation to supersede any sort of personal political considerations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Constitution calls on us to do.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the expectation of our constituents.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll conclude.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question, follow up.\xc2\xa0 Last week -- two weeks ago I asked you about the term \xe2\x80\x9cgenocide\xe2\x80\x9d as related to Syrian Christians.\xc2\xa0 It was asked again today.\xc2\xa0 When is that decision going to be made?\xc2\xa0 We keep saying it\xe2\x80\x99s illegal, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- when can we have a definitive answer on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeframe for that, but I\xe2\x80\x99d check with the State Department.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the agency that is taking a look at this and they may have some guidance to share with you in terms of timing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>\n\t2:08 P.M.
