Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>*Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>1:05 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, let me just begin by saying, on behalf of the Biden family, how deeply appreciative they are of the outpouring of love and support that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received since Beau Biden\xe2\x80\x99s passing on Saturday evening.\xc2\xa0 There have been many kind words and gestures that have been offered not just all across the country, but all around the world.\xc2\xa0 And they have meant a great deal to the Vice President and to his family.</p>\n<p>For those of you in this room, or for anybody watching who\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a way to pay their respects to Beau and to those who loved him, I\xe2\x80\x99d invite you to visit WhiteHouse.gov, where we have set up a virtual condolence book.\xc2\xa0 All of the entries in the book will be collected and shared with the Biden family.</p>\n<p>So with that, Jim, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And sympathies to the family.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to talk a little about the action on Sunday, in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you could give us an assessment on how terror cases are being pursued any differently now that we\xe2\x80\x99re 13 hours until the expiration of those FISA Patriot Act provisions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, the failure of the United States Senate to act to renew the authorities that were included in the Patriot Act has had an impact on the ability -- or on the authorities that our national security professionals can use to keep up safe.</p>\n<p>Now, what the President had advocated, and what built strong bipartisan support in the House, and, I believe, has strong bipartisan support in the Senate is a piece of legislation that would both incorporate reforms that would protect our privacy and civil liberties -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cour,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the privacy and civil liberties of the American people -- as well as renewing tools that our national security professionals use to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is those reforms have not been enacted into law, and the extension of those important tools have not been enacted into law.</p>\n<p>As a practical matter, what that means is it means that our national security establishment is not using Section 215 authority to collect bulk telephony data.\xc2\xa0 That has been the source of some controversy, and that is what the President and his national security team proposed be reformed.\xc2\xa0 Those reforms, again, are included in the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are also a set of other non-controversial authorities that are not currently available to our national security professionals.\xc2\xa0 That includes the authority to go and get a warrant, and use Section 215 to conduct investigations of individuals who are suspected of having links to terrorism.\xc2\xa0 It also means that our national security professionals do not have authorities that they need to go and get a warrant, and get a roving wiretap of individuals who are suspected of having links to terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And it also means that our national security professionals do not have the authority that they need to go and get a warrant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And under the \xe2\x80\x9clone wolf\xe2\x80\x9d provision -- now, this is a provision that of course we have acknowledged has not been used previously, but this is a provision that, if it were needed today, could not be used by our national security professionals.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said for weeks now is that the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act introduces unnecessary risk to the country and to our citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in this period of time -- granted, it\xe2\x80\x99s only 13 hours -- but has the President been notified by either the intelligence community or the Department of Justice?\xc2\xa0 Have there been instances where they are now not able to pursue a particular specific case, testing the lack of authorities?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details to share about either ongoing or recently started national security investigations.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve also acknowledged is true is that our national security professionals have other tools that they can use to conduct investigations.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t have tools that replace these critically -- these important authorities, but there are other tools that they can use to conduct investigations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as we understand it, roving wiretaps that had already been approved, those can continue during this period?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is what\xe2\x80\x99s called a grandfather clause, which means that for the routine use of Section 215 -- so again, not the bulk data collection, but the routine use of 215 that would allow an individual suspected of having ties to terrorism, that would allow national security professionals to examine related business records.\xc2\xa0 Those authorities, as they relate to ongoing investigations, are not affected.\xc2\xa0 Those investigations continue.\xc2\xa0 But our law enforcement and our national security professionals do not have the authority to collect those kinds of records or to seek those kinds of warrants under a newly started investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell, this morning, issued a statement calling for passage of the USA Freedom Act with -- and endorsed several amendments.\xc2\xa0 One of them would extend the transition period on the bulk collection of phone data from the government to the phone companies to a year, rather than the six months provided in the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the administration would oppose, suppose, be agnostic about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the administration views as completely unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, our national security professionals have explained that in order to implement the reforms that are included in the USA Freedom Act, that it would require a six-month time period for them to carry out the change that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just described.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are confident that that six-month time period would give our national security professionals ample time to implement these reforms.\xc2\xa0 But if for some reason that amount of time is judged to be insufficient, the President has directed his national security team to go back to Congress and ask for additional time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that an amendment like this is not necessary.\xc2\xa0 We believe that six months is enough.\xc2\xa0 Again, if they conclude upon the beginning of the implementation period that six months is not enough time, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to Congress and ask for additional time.\xc2\xa0 And based on the comments of Senator McConnell and others, we feel confident that Congress would act quickly to give us additional time in the unlikely event that it\xe2\x80\x99s needed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bottom line, you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not have any amendments done?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bottom line, we would like to see the Senate pass this piece of legislation as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 This is a bill, the USA Freedom, that collected 338 votes in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 It got strong support from Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The Senate should not get into a game where they start adding amendments to this piece of legislation that then requires House consideration again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that the Senate should act as quickly as possible to pass the USA Freedom so he can sign it into law.\xc2\xa0 And we can do two important things.\xc2\xa0 The first is begin to implement the reforms over a six-month period that are contemplated in the USA Freedom Act that will better protect our civil liberties, but also ensure that our national security professionals have the tools they need to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the Senate have the right to exert its will on the legislation?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the legislative process for them to change legislation.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course, they do, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how the process works.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 I think that I would just observe that they have had a year and a half to exercise that prerogative.\xc2\xa0 And now that they have blown through the deadline, I think most reasonable people would assume that that is a privilege and a right that they, for the good of the country, should relinquish so that we can enact a piece of legislation that has the strong support of Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It has the strong support of our national security professionals and, of course, it has the strong support of the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And rather than get into additional political gamesmanship, the Senate should pass the USA Freedom Act so the President can sign it into law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you real quick about one of several Americans being held by Houthis in Yemen?\xc2\xa0 Apparently, he has been released following negotiations with Omani officials.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that and offer any details?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer any details about those reports because of privacy considerations.\xc2\xa0 But we are working to provide additional details at an appropriate time, which hopefully would be relatively soon.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about the case.</p>\n<p>Julia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on that, has there been any change in the way the U.S. has communicated with these families, considering the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a review of the hostage policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9cthese families\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Families of Americans who have been held by Houthis.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any policy changes on that, no.\xc2\xa0 The individuals who are detained there are individuals that we are trying to secure their release.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then after Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s injury over the weekend, is the White House concerned that that injury may preclude him from participating in Iran nuclear talks?\xc2\xa0 And is there any consideration of sending someone to participate in his place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand, Julia, that even now as we speak, that Secretary Kerry is en route back to Boston for treatment on his broken leg.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, Dr. Dennis Burke, is traveling with the Secretary to Boston to monitor his condition and to ensure that he remains comfortable in flight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President and his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, each had the opportunity to speak with Secretary Kerry yesterday to wish him well on a speedy recovery.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has made clear that he is going to pursue an aggressive but responsible recovery schedule, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of recovery trajectories that are possible when we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with an injury like this.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, his doctors and Secretary Kerry himself will have more to say about this relatively soon.</p>\n<p>But the fact is that we do continue to believe that we have the time and resources necessary to pursue and, hopefully, complete the Iran negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that those negotiations will be affected by the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s injury.\xc2\xa0 But exactly how we move forward on this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So still unsure of whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to participate?\xc2\xa0 I mean, considering we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a 30-day window here.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Secretary Kerry will continue to be an important part of this effort.\xc2\xa0 Whether he is going to spend every day over the next four weeks in Europe negotiating face to face with his counterpart, it seems unlikely that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that given the injury that he has sustained.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that in whatever capacity he is able to participate, that Secretary Kerry will continue to play a critically important role in that effort.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just first, on the security of Americans right now.\xc2\xa0 You weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to comment about whether in these 13 hours there\xe2\x80\x99s been any problems.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s go back, if we can, in history here.\xc2\xa0 Can you point to anything in the past that would not have been successful under these current conditions?\xc2\xa0 Is there somebody we would not have caught?\xc2\xa0 Is there something that you could explain to Americans why this is so important, using history?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are -- probably not in as much detail as will satisfy you right at the top here, but I think I can offer up two compelling reasons why our national security professionals say that having these authorities is important to the national security of the country.</p>\n<p>The first is that there are recent examples -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t go into those examples -- but recent examples where our national security professionals say that information that they obtained using these authorities was information that they were not previously aware of.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that these authorities have succeeded in eliciting information that\xe2\x80\x99s been critical to ongoing investigations.</p>\n<p>The second thing is that the way that our investigators talk about this information is that these pieces of information as they\xe2\x80\x99re collected are critically important building blocks to an investigation.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is it means that a clearer picture is provided when you put a variety of pieces of information together; that as it fits together, you get a clearer sense of what it is that you\xe2\x80\x99re investigating.</p>\n<p>Now, in some cases, that could even be information or building blocks of information that can be used to exonerate somebody.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a useful thing too.\xc2\xa0 We have very limited law enforcement and national security resources, and if there are individuals who we conclude, based on available information, that they no longer are a subject of significant concern, that means that we can focus our resources in other areas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think what many in the public might want to really hear from the White House is, on a scale of one to ten, how much less safe are we today than we were on Saturday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is something that our national security professionals can speak more directly to.\xc2\xa0 I think the way that I would characterize it is simply this, Jim -- that we have these authorities that were included in the Patriot Act, the majority of which are not controversial and have been in place since 2001, and as our national security professionals tell us, have been used to elicit information that\xe2\x80\x99s been valuable to ongoing national security investigations.</p>\n<p>And so the question that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me offer up a few times from the podium here over the last week or so is simply, why would we add unnecessary risk to the country and our national security because of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act?\xc2\xa0 The fact is, we have these authorities; many of them have not been controversial -- though one controversial authority, the one that\xe2\x80\x99s been the subject of extensive debate, is one that would be subject to extensive reforms if the Senate had just passed the bill that was passed by the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>And so I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the argument, which is why would we incorporate this unnecessary risk?\xc2\xa0 Apparently, there are some members of Congress who look for an opportunity -- members of the United States Senate who look for an opportunity to build a political advantage, to gain a political advantage, and they apparently concluded that the risk was worth it.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can just change subjects to Cuba for a moment.\xc2\xa0 In Panama, the President said directly that the United States is no longer in the business of regime change in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And yet, the United States, including this administration, continues to fund both the State Department and USAID to the tune of some $264 million since \xe2\x80\x9994, with specific programs operating inside Cuba, some of which have been embarrassing, as reported by the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Why do we continue -- why does the United States continue to fund these programs?\xc2\xa0 And now, as relations are very close to being normalized, do you see those programs being ended?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, for specific programs that are being operated by either USAID or the State Department, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those two agencies.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that the U.S. government will continue to invest in efforts to strengthen the engagement between our two countries, between our two governments, and even between the citizens of our two countries.\xc2\xa0 And this is a critical component of the strategy that the President announced at the end of last year; that for more than five decades, the United States had pursued a strategy to try to isolate Cuba to compel them to better respect the basic universal human rights of their people.\xc2\xa0 And for more than five decades, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see much improvement in that regard.</p>\n<p>So what the President has said is let\xe2\x80\x99s try a different strategy; let\xe2\x80\x99s try a strategy where we strengthen the ties between the United States and Cuba; let\xe2\x80\x99s create opportunities for more commerce between our two countries; let\xe2\x80\x99s give more Americans the opportunity to travel to Cuba, and give the Cuban people greater exposure to the kind of values and lifestyle that we so deeply value in this country; and that by promoting that kind of engagement, we can actually place additional pressure on the Cuban government to do a better job of living up to the values and the protection of basic universal human rights that we hold so dear in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the USAID mission specifically says that we\xe2\x80\x99ll use this money to -- with the goal of promoting a rapid, peaceful transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0 That sounds as though -- that sounds like a way of saying regime change.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly the opposite of what the President said is going on now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, USAID can speak to the direct purpose of the programs that they carry out.\xc2\xa0 But certainly promoting democracy and promoting respect for basic universal human rights is part of our goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the word is transition, though.\xc2\xa0 That is problematic isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\'s problematic or not; you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to USAID about their specific program.\xc2\xa0 But this idea that the United States is going to go and promote our values around the world is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in for quite some time in a variety of countries.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to continue to do that in a place like Cuba that so frequently tramples those kinds of values.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, the Radio Marti and TV Marti, do you see any changes with that agenda, what they\xe2\x80\x99ll be used for, with the hundreds of millions of dollars spent there?\xc2\xa0 Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a new era.\xc2\xa0 Are those two still valid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as it relates to reforms to those programs, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department that operates there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chip, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to see you.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about the 1 to 10 point scale.\xc2\xa0 But just to really put it bluntly, are the American people clearly less safe today than they were last week?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that is a judgment that one of our national security professionals could make based on their own efforts to investigate this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you went through this whole list of things that are not available now.\xc2\xa0 It sounds that the implication of that is that we are less safe now than we were just a day or two ago.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let people draw whatever conclusion they would like.\xc2\xa0 But the one -- the fact that I can confirm for you is that there are specific tools that our national security professionals have previously used to conduct national security investigations that they can, as of today, no longer use because of the partisan dysfunction in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CIA Director Brennan said over the weekend that if the law lapsed, and of course it now has, the FBI would lose the ability to track people intent on carrying out attacks on the homeland.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m certainly not going to contradict the Director of the CIA --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have lost the ability for -- the FBI has lost the ability to track people who are intent on carrying out attacks on the homeland?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a variety of tools that are used by our national security professionals to conduct both law enforcement and national security investigations.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that there are tools that are critical to that effort that are no longer available -- or at least as of today are no available to our national security professionals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why we want the Senate to act on the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0 Because if they will pass that piece of legislation that got such strong bipartisan support in the House, the President will immediately sign into law and we will codify greater reforms to that program -- those programs that will protect our civil liberties, while at the same time ensuring that the non-controversial authorities that have been used by national security professionals can continue to be used to protect the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President follow Senator Paul\xe2\x80\x99s actions over the weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he did.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that he did like many of us did, which is read some news accounts.\xc2\xa0 But we are not following this minute-by-minute like some of you had to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham today, saying -- in announcing for the presidency, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSad to admit Barack Obama has made us less safe.\xc2\xa0 Simply put, radical Islam is running wild.\xc2\xa0 They have more safe havens, more money, more weapons, and more capability to strike our homeland than any time since 9/11.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Comment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been a number of pronouncements and accusations that have been lobbed by those who aspire to occupy the Oval Office in early 2017.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not going to get into a -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best to try to avoid getting into a back and forth with any of them on a specific issue.\xc2\xa0 So while I obviously disagree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Graham, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an interest in getting into a back and forth with him at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not less safe today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with what Senator Graham had to say today in kicking off his campaign.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the things that Senator Paul said this weekend was that this situation is really the President\xe2\x80\x99s fault because he could have ended the bulk collection of phone records at any time.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t need congressional approval.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that you needed congressional approval to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, we have made this argument in a variety of areas.\xc2\xa0 This is true when it comes to a variety of economic priorities that the President has articulated.\xc2\xa0 It\'s even true when it comes to immigration -- that the kinds of changes that we would like to see codified into law are more effectively changed when Congress passes a law to do it.</p>\n<p>And the good news is that the President, demonstrating some leadership on this issue, actually called for specific reforms to be put in place more than a year a half ago -- or about a year and a half ago.\xc2\xa0 He directed his national security team to travel to Capitol Hill to spend time in a large number of meetings with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, working through the policy questions at stake here.\xc2\xa0 And they succeeded in working effectively in bipartisan fashion to reform these programs, and specifically reform the program that Senator Paul has complained about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so it\'s ironic, to say the least, that Senator Paul blocked a piece of legislation that would have actually solved the problem that he was talking about.\xc2\xa0 So that may have been an effective campaign tactic, but it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You, too.\xc2\xa0 At what point, legally, does the President think that he or a future President can no longer rely on the 2001 AUMF to go after ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the 2001 AUMF obviously is related to countering the threat that is posed by al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And the conditions for making that kind of assessment will obviously be determined based on what kind of activity we see from al Qaeda around the world, and what sort of national security threat is facing the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say the President has already given a speech in which he called for -- years ago -- called for Congress to act to refine the 2001 AUMF in a way that would narrow the scope of that authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 There continues to be a threat that is posed by al Qaeda, and the President believes that our national security agencies, and the President himself, should have the authority that they need to counter that threat.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been clear that he believes that improvements and even additional limitations on the 2001 AUMF can be put in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a point when this AUMF from 14 years ago will be stretched beyond what you\xe2\x80\x99re legally allowed to use it for?\xc2\xa0 If we send 10,000 U.S. military personnel overseas, if this stretched out for another five to ten years, does the President believe, legally, that the 2001 AUMF can still be used through all of this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a lot of hypotheticals that were floated in there.\xc2\xa0 Let me just illustrate -- let me try to illustrate the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view by talking a little about the authorization to use military force against ISIL that the administration submitted to Congress several months ago now.</p>\n<p>Included in that authorization to use military force was essentially a provision that would place a time limit on that AUMF.\xc2\xa0 That proposal included a three-year time limit for that authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the 2001 AUMF is one that is open-ended.\xc2\xa0 And some of the reforms that the President has suggested do contemplate imposing a time limit on those authorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the reason for that -- and this was true in the AUMF-against-ISIL language that the President put forward -- even if the authority -- or even if the threat that prompted that authority to be enacted still exists, by placing a time limit on the AUMF you would force Congress to come back and reconsider that AUMF.\xc2\xa0 And that means that after three years, Congress could just essentially approve an extension or they could consider whether or not there are certain authorities that could be curtailed, and the AUMF could be refined in a way that would start to put in place some additional limitations.</p>\n<p>But, again, all of this should be driven based on -- or driven by the assessment of the ongoing threat.\xc2\xa0 And the President does believe that the threat from al Qaeda has changed significantly since 2001.\xc2\xa0 It has changed in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress in decimating core al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 There continues to be a more disaggregated threat from al Qaeda affiliates in other terrorist organizations that are or were previously affiliated with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 We have to be very cognizant and vigilant about meeting those threats, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that refining the 2001 AUMF is something that Congress should do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think even I would acknowledge -- and the President would acknowledge this, too -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult work than doing something as simple as passing an 2001* AUMF against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Everybody acknowledges that we have -- or just about everybody acknowledges that we have a threat from ISIL that we need to mitigate.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that it would be wise and appropriate, and even necessary, for Congress to pass an AUMF that reflects that specific threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen very little movement in Congress, despite the fact that the administration has convened a large number of meetings with Democrats and Republicans to discuss this issue, despite the fact that the administration actually submitted draft language to Congress, despite the fact that senior national security officials like the Department of Defense -- or the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State have participated in congressional hearings on this matter.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any movement in Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been a source of some frustration.</p>\n<p>I guess the point is, that\xe2\x80\x99s why unfortunately I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly optimistic that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the kind of refinements to the 2001 AUMF that the President advocated several years ago.</p>\n<p>Francesca.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I have a second question about the Patriot Act, but first I wanted to get clarification on your response to Cheryl\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 When I asked you a similar question last week -- and, again, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m misunderstanding -- it seemed to me that you said that the President couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just change the way that the NSA program was running; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just issue an executive order to address that because only Congress could make those changes.\xc2\xa0 But in response to Cheryl, I thought that you said that Congress would be more effective at doing that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to unpack here.\xc2\xa0 In terms of making some changes that the President believes are important, and as it relates to the carrying out of these programs, there is only so much the President can do using his executive authority.</p>\n<p>So, for example, many people had suggested that even if Congress did allow these authorities to expire, that the President should just use his executive authority to try to extend those programs or extend those tools.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, is something that the President can\xe2\x80\x99t do just using his executive authority.\xc2\xa0 What Senator Paul has advocated is essentially not using those programs anymore.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has advocated is essentially reforming those programs.\xc2\xa0 And many of the reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are reforms that require congressional action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second question related to that is also about Senator Paul, and you said that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to the comments that he made.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m specifically wondering if the White House generally has a reaction to him saying that, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople here in town think I\xe2\x80\x99m making a huge mistake.\xc2\xa0 Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Any White House reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what Chip was talking about was Senator Graham and his campaign announcement, so you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something different.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat it so that we\xe2\x80\x99re clear.\xc2\xa0 This is comments that Senator Paul specifically made.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople here in town think I\xe2\x80\x99m making a huge mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d in relation to the Patriot Act, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSome of them, I think, secretly\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s got the first part right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree with the second part.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cSome of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President and his national security team go to great lengths to be vigilant to protect the country from any sort of terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 And what we have advocated, and what the President himself has directly advocated is ensuring that the United States Senate do the bare minimum that\xe2\x80\x99s required to ensure that our national security professionals, some of whom put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe, have all the tools they need to do their job.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have urged the United States Senate to do what the United States House of Representatives has already done, which is to pass the USA Freedom Act, which includes critically important civil liberties reforms, and extend the ability of our national security professionals to use all the tools available to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to kind of circle back to what Jim was asking, about amendments.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m stipulating that you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t want amendments because you want USA Freedom to go through as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 It still seems like the Senate is going to vote on them.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you guys have perceived any poison pills in the amendments that have been floated already, things that can possible sort of torpedo this whole bill.\xc2\xa0 I know one that Senator McConnell said today would be a tweak that would essentially keep the FISA Court decision secret, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that would have come out into the light under the House version of the bill.\xc2\xa0 Are there areas of concern that you think blow up sort of the greater negotiation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t looked through each of the specific amendments.\xc2\xa0 The reason I was able to talk about the amendment that Jim mentioned is that that\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in here a few times.\xc2\xa0 I think you even asked me about it before -- this idea of extending the implementation period.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\'t considered those -- all of the amendments that may be voted on by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But as it becomes clear which amendments are actually going to be voted on, we may be able to get you some more information in terms of our position on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And more broadly, I mean, in conversations that you guys have had with the House, Leader McCarthy today was a little unclear about whether or not they would be willing to even take up an amended version of this bill.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern that you guys have, that this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass the House bill --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the concern that we have is that it will, in any event, take additional time if the Senate passes an amended version of the USA Freedom Act, because then it will have to be put back on the House to consider that amended piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 And that typically takes time; sometimes it takes a long time.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, in this case, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but that remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>I think the other thing that we have expressed some concern about is that Democrats and Republicans in the House did work in rather painstaking fashion to build this common-sense, bipartisan reform proposal.\xc2\xa0 And for the Senate, again, after they\xe2\x80\x99ve already blown through the deadline, to start tinkering with that bipartisan agreement does put that agreement at some risk; that you may have an eventuality where the bipartisan agreement that was, again, painstakingly built in the House of Representatives, falls apart.\xc2\xa0 And that would prevent the specific reforms from going into effect, and it would prevent our national security professionals from getting the tools that they say are important to keeping us safe.</p>\n<p>So again, that highlights yet another reason why we believe that the Congress should act quickly to pass the USA Freedom Act in its current form so the President can sign it into law as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a last one on Greece?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to a potential for default, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the administration has taken any new steps to protect the U.S. financial system in case of a default, and if you can maybe discuss just how -- generally, how much of a risk that poses to the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any specific steps that I can share with you, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 They may have some more information on this.</p>\n<p>I would note that Secretary Lew last week spoke at the G7 finance minister\xe2\x80\x99s meeting in Dresden, and again urged all parties to find common ground and reach an agreement quickly.\xc2\xa0 While he was there, Secretary Lew also spoke with Prime Minister Tsipras from Greece and emphasized that we remain engaged with all parties involved, including Greece, its European partners and the IMF.</p>\n<p>It is our view that these parties should continue to do the important work of trying to resolve their differences as soon as possible to try to prevent some instability and turbulence from being injected into the global financial markets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a worry that that instability would have a kind of substantial impact on the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly do operate in an interconnected global economy.\xc2\xa0 And instability, in one aspect of the global economy, typically does have an impact on the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think in this case it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how significant that would be, or how significant an impact would be on the United States.\xc2\xa0 But I guess to pick up on a theme of this briefing, that seems like an unnecessary risk.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary Lew in particular has done a lot of really important work behind the scenes to try to bring -- or facilitate the efforts of those who are sitting at the table to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People who are opposed to certain parts of the Patriot Act have been pretty explicit in outlining these ways that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really help certain cases, or that there are other methods to get the same information.\xc2\xa0 But conversely, you and the administration, you can\xe2\x80\x99t list or won\xe2\x80\x99t list any concrete examples of how it did help; you won\xe2\x80\x99t say whether the American public is less safe now.\xc2\xa0 If this is so important, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t your argument seem to be weaker than those in opposition?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that contributing to the controversy that\xe2\x80\x99s out there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That certainly is not the conclusion of 338 Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives who came together around a common-sense bipartisan proposal that would implement reforms, that would strengthen civil liberties protections while also reauthorizing tools that our national security professionals say are important to keeping us safe.</p>\n<p>I think the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s true is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of claims on the other side of this argument that haven\xe2\x80\x99t borne out to be true.\xc2\xa0 And there has been an effort on the part of the administration, even given the constraints that we have about talking about classified or highly sensitive national security programs, to be as honest and forthright and candid about these programs and about the impact that they have on our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned campaign tactics, you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned that some people want to be in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that these are just -- that some of the arguments out there are just political posturing?\xc2\xa0 Are you just flat-out saying that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- again, in the United States Senate, prior to the expiration of this specific -- I guess a week before the expiration of the Patriot Act, you saw every single Democrat in the United States Senate line up behind the bipartisan proposal that was passed by the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a whole lot of posturing within the Republican Party on this issue in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s been the source of a lot of disappointment, given that you had a piece of legislation that accomplished all of the objectives of the vast majority of people involved in this dispute.\xc2\xa0 You had some people in the Republican Party who are saying we need to reform these programs.\xc2\xa0 Well, reforms were exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0 And you had others in the Republican Party who are saying these are critically important tools that our national security professionals need to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 Well, they could<br/>\n\tprotect those tools by passing the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it was a source of such disappointment that you saw so many Republicans who didn\xe2\x80\x99t support this proposal when it first came up 10 days ago.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- at least speaking for myself -- I was not at all surprised that we saw 19 or 20 additional Republicans essentially flip-flop on this and, after spending a week on Memorial Day recess up against the deadline, decide that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to support a proposal that just a week earlier they\xe2\x80\x99d filibustered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- in terms of -- to go back to the strength of arguments, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why I have a pretty strong argument when I say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of politics being played on this.\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s coming at the expense of the national security and civil liberties of the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when we keep talking about national security, you use the word \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d almost every other word in some of your statements.\xc2\xa0 So if you feel so strongly about some of these programs without being able to give any concrete examples of them working, why can\xe2\x80\x99t you at least say that the American public is less safe without them?\xc2\xa0 It almost seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re going just up to that point.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that way or don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel that way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would encourage you to ask some of our national security professionals.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the FBI Director, Jim Comey, talk about how important these tools are to their work.\xc2\xa0 I saw that the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Brennan, was on Chip\xe2\x80\x99s network over the weekend, talking about how these programs and these authorities were integral to the efforts of the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 So I would defer to those professionals.\xc2\xa0 They can give you the best assessment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All I can say is -- make the simple, fact-based observation that there are tools that our national security professionals say are important to their work that today they don\xe2\x80\x99t have because of a bunch of Republican senators who played politics with these issue over the last couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 Rand Paul has his own plan to hire a thousand more FBI agents to do some of the work that would take the -- I guess substitute for bulk phone data collection.\xc2\xa0 So what does the White House think of that plan to just hire more people to do the digging instead of bulk collection?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the specifics of that proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given the President\xe2\x80\x99s early queasiness with some of these programs, some of the national security programs that were left to him by the previous President, is he comfortable that if and when this gets re-upped again in the next few days, that history judges that this is now his program?\xc2\xa0 That he now owns the bulk collection program by virtue of the fact that you guys have been out there arguing for it so vociferously, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable with that being -- kind of taking ownership of it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, to be clear, Mike, what the reforms that the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team have negotiated with Democrats and Republicans in the House are reforms that would actually end the government\xe2\x80\x99s use of these authorities to collect bulk data.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the reforms did.\xc2\xa0 So to the extent that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, I would suspect that that would be a logical conclusion from some historians that the President ended some of these programs that did raise concerns about those who prioritized the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is consistent with reforms that the President advocated a year and a half ago, and these are reforms that required the President and his team to expend significant amounts of political capital to achieve, over the objection of Republicans.</p>\n<p>So I do feel confident that, based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s record, that the kinds of reforms and changes that he promised to bring into office in 2007 and 2008 are reforms that he has succeeded, over the objection of Republicans, of implementing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to be clear, he\xe2\x80\x99s not ending the government\xe2\x80\x99s use of the information.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s changing the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s held and collected, and where -- who holds the data.\xc2\xa0 But the government is still using the information under the USA Freedom Act, and it becomes now -- this sort of becomes the first time that he gets to -- that he puts his imprimatur on that bulk collection, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s -- it may be worth us having somebody from the national security agencies talk to you about this, because this information that private-sector companies are already collecting; they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it on their customers.\xc2\xa0 When you get your bill every month, you see the detailed list of phone calls and phone numbers and the length of the phone calls that you placed over the course of that month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, yes, the federal government would continue to have access to that information if they obtain a warrant from a judge, based on authority that is given to the administration by Congress, and subject to oversight not just by Congress, but by inspectors general and other national security attorneys in the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 This is the kind of rigorous oversight and, essentially, a rules architecture that the President does believe is important.\xc2\xa0 And that is materially different than the program that he inherited.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to Leaders McConnell or Reid today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any telephone calls from the President to read out at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does he see his role in making sure that this does, in fact, get done over the next few days?\xc2\xa0 It looks like that is what is likely going to happen.\xc2\xa0 But what does he perceive his role to be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, over the last couple of weeks, has spent a lot of time publicly advocating Senate action.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in this regard started more than a year and a half ago, where he contemplated and then delivered a speech laying out the kinds of reforms that he would like to see to these programs.\xc2\xa0 He directed his national security team to go to Capitol Hill and engage in bipartisan discussions about how to institute these reforms in a way that would add protections to our civil liberties while making sure that our national security professionals had access to all the tools that they need to do their work.\xc2\xa0 And he has worked in bipartisan fashion to build support for this in the House and to build support for it in the Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President continues to be an advocate of the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0 And again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls or anything to preview, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on this I think are quite well know, both publicly and in private.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, given that these programs -- which are now so integral to national security -- which you\xe2\x80\x99re arguing have expired, does the President need to more than just publicly advocate?\xc2\xa0 Does he need to go to Capitol Hill, for example?\xc2\xa0 Does he need to be picking up the phone on a regular basis and making sure that something does, in fact, get passed in the next few days?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is that the President has been engaged in this; you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about it publicly.\xc2\xa0 There have been conversations that the President and senior White House officials have had privately on this over the last week or so.\xc2\xa0 And again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in this regard go back a year and a half.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you about the Taliban Five.\xc2\xa0 The travel ban has been extended.\xc2\xa0 Why did it take so long?\xc2\xa0 Why did it take coming right up against the deadline to make that happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the priority that the administration has placed on this particular situation is ensuring that steps are implemented to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re mitigating the risk to our national security from these individuals.\xc2\xa0 And there are restrictions that have been in place for a year that continue to be in place today, and we continue to be in touch with our partners in Qatar who have imposed some of those restrictions about what our path forward will be.\xc2\xa0 Those restrictions, under the agreement that was initially reached, would be put in place for a year.\xc2\xa0 And the path forward is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing now with the Qataris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it has been extended, correct?\xc2\xa0 The travel ban?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is still in place.\xc2\xa0 But for the longer-term path forward, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s still under discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say specifically how long it will be in place under the current plan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it certainly will be in place until an additional agreement can be reached about steps that we believe are necessary to protect the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that three of them have tried to reach out to their terror network.\xc2\xa0 So what type of safeguards are being put in place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have a variety of safeguards, but very few, if any, of which we can talk about publicly I think for reasons that should be fairly obvious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that the safeguards will prevent them from taking action?\xc2\xa0 I mean, given the fact that there are these reports that they have, in fact, reached out to terror networks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, most importantly, before these individuals were transferred from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, the Secretary of Defense had to certify that there was a strategy for mitigating the risk that these individuals posed to the United States and our national security.\xc2\xa0 That strategy has been implemented by our partners in Qatar, and we continue to be in touch with them about what strategy -- what system will be in place moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some concern if, in fact, they have reached out to their terror networks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are individuals that, yes, that we are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 That, in fact, is why we have put restrictive measures in place to prevent them from --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the measures working, though, if they\xe2\x80\x99re able to contact these people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Kristen, these are individuals who we have been working with our partners in Qatar to restrict their movements and to restrict the impact that they could possibly have on our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one about Secretary Kerry.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned at all that the nuclear talks will be hampered because he will be absent for a period of time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as Secretary Kerry is treated for his injuries from over the weekend, it is likely to have an impact on the manner in which he participates in those discussions over the course of this month.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned earlier, I do anticipate that Secretary Kerry will continue to play a critically important and leading role in conducting and hopefully completing those negotiations by the end of the month.</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to add to that and get your thoughts on Ambassador Rice.\xc2\xa0 Can you sort of outline her role and how that might change, given the injury to Secretary Kerry?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell exactly what sort of change we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to incorporate into Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s role.\xc2\xa0 He has played a leading role in this previously, and I would anticipate that he is going to continue to play a leading role.\xc2\xa0 His injuries may prevent him from having the kind of aggressive travel schedule that you all are accustomed to him having, but I have no doubt that he will continue to play an important role in this effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s role?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any change at this point.\xc2\xa0 But if something changes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How engaged was the President in the conversations about the Taliban Five up until the extension that you mentioned moments ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has directed his national security team.\xc2\xa0 There are established channels for having these conversations and for reaching these kinds of agreements with our partners around the world -- in this case, in Qatar.\xc2\xa0 There were a set of restrictive conditions that were placed on these individuals when they were transferred to the custody of the government of Qatar.\xc2\xa0 Our partners in Qatar have lived up to the commitments that they made in the context of those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And as we continue to talk to them about the path forward, those restrictive conditions remain in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to just follow up on something Michelle asked you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you be very forceful about a number of issues, but I also can tell when you\xe2\x80\x99re being careful.\xc2\xa0 It seems to me when you won\xe2\x80\x99t just come out and say \xe2\x80\x9cwe are less safe,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason behind it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is it because, frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not less safe because the Patriot Act provisions have elapsed?\xc2\xa0 Are we basically the same because there are plenty of other tools available already?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, all I can do is I can illustrate to you very clearly that there are tools that had previously been available to our national security professionals that are not available today because the Senate didn\xe2\x80\x99t do their job, because we saw Republicans in the Senate engage in a lot of political back and forth as opposed to engaging in the critically important work of the country.</p>\n<p>And as a result, there are programs and tools that our national security professionals themselves say are important to their work that are not available to them right now as we speak.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we urge the Senate to set aside the politicking and actually focus on their basic responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will vote in favor of the common-sense, bipartisan reform proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s already passed the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Sarah.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve referred to the non-controversial programs that have expired as an \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The framers of the original Patriot Act have said that they designed it the way they did because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that it works best.\xc2\xa0 So by changing the controversial programs in the USA Freedom Act, does that mean that there are certain necessary risks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking away a tool that our national security professionals have had in terms of having this bulk data in government hands.\xc2\xa0 There are some questions about to what extent the service providers would be forced to provide the data to government.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a necessary risk to protect civil liberties?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant risk, and here\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xc2\xa0 This is data that, once the USA Freedom Act is implemented, that the U.S. government would no longer collect under these authorities.\xc2\xa0 But they would still have access to the data because it\xe2\x80\x99s information that\xe2\x80\x99s being preserved and collected by the telecoms companies.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is the information that you get on your monthly cell phone bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our national security professionals would still have the authority to review that information after obtaining a court order to review that information.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with what our national security professionals say that they need to conduct these investigations.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would be in a position to say that this is a significant, unnecessary risk, or even a necessary risk.\xc2\xa0 This is a policy solution that addresses the concerns that have been raised by some about protecting the civil liberties of the American people while ensuring that our national security professionals have the tools that they need to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why I feel confident in making the case to you that we can both put in place significant reforms and address concerns that have been raised by some, rather aggressively, while also making sure that our national security professionals can do the important work of protecting the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so you\xe2\x80\x99re 100 percent confident that, under the USA Freedom Act, that national security professionals would actually have the access to that data from any telephone company that they need?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is what our national security professionals say, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 The people that are working for this -- who are working on this on a daily basis have said that the reforms that are included in the USA Freedom Act are reforms that would both bolster civil liberties protections while also giving them the access to the information that they need to do their work.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details scheduled about the upcoming visit of South Korean President Park Geun-hye to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, can you speak up just a little bit?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details scheduled about upcoming visit of --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of President Park?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, President Park to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule yet, but I would expect in the coming days that we will have a more detailed schedule about that visit.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President is looking forward to meeting with President Park and discussing so many of the important issues that we coordinate closely with our allies in South Korea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is this office related, or a state visit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 As we collect more details on this, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Victoria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius is saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that international inspectors have access to military sites and also to the military as part of any kind of Iran nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Victoria, this is something that we discussed at some length with Iran and our P5+1 partners in the context of the political agreement that was reached the first week in April.\xc2\xa0 And that political agreement would impose the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are also another set of inspections and requirements that would be imposed on Iran that a bunch of other countries are subject to, as well.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m speaking of are what are described as the additional protocols.\xc2\xa0 And these are essentially a set of rules and regulations that govern the inspection of countries\xe2\x80\x99 nuclear programs.\xc2\xa0 And those additional protocols that are in place against other countries, in addition to being in place against Iran if they sign on to the agreement, do include inspections of military facilities under a whole set of specific circumstances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so there are still some details to be worked out.\xc2\xa0 But the point of all this is that the President is only going to sign on to an agreement at the end of June whose details reflect the kinds of political commitments that were made by Iran in the first week in April.\xc2\xa0 And that is the principle that we have in place here.</p>\n<p>There are additional details obviously that need to be negotiated and pinned down -- a lot of I\xe2\x80\x99s to dot and T\xe2\x80\x99s to cross -- because the devil is in the details here.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on those details as we get into the last month of negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Ayatollah Khamenei said just recently as last week that international inspectors would not get access to military sites.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have a conversation about.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that there is a political agreement that was reached in the first week in April in which Iran agreed to cooperate with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And the point is that there are other countries whose nuclear program requires some inspections that are conducted at military facilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have been clear in the context of that political agreement that the possible military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program are questions that will have to be resolved in the context of these negotiations.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got another month or so to work through these details.\xc2\xa0 But the President will not sign an agreement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the agreements -- commitments that were made in the context of the political agreement that was announced the first week in April.</p>\n<p>In the back, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I had a question about Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 Now that all three branches of government have rejected the use of the Patriot Act to justify bulk collection by the NSA -- as you said, first the White House and then the appeal court the other week, and now Congress -- is it time to reassess the persecution of the man who revealed the existence of this program to the American people?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that Mr. Snowden committed very serious crimes, and the U.S. government and Department of Justice believe that he should face them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States where he will face due process, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity -- if he returned to the United States -- to make that case in a court of law.\xc2\xa0 But obviously our view on this is that he committed and is accused of very serious crimes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow.\xc2\xa0 The wrinkle, as you may know, is that he says he would be willing to come back if he can use a whistle blow defense in court.\xc2\xa0 And the Department of Justice has said it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to consider that, and the charges that he\xe2\x80\x99s charged with wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow that.\xc2\xa0 Would you be willing to at least talk to him about the circumstances in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve said you would give him a fair trial?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is something that the Department of Justice would handle in conversations with him, if they\xe2\x80\x99re having them.</p>\n<p>The thing I would point out that I think is factually relevant to that argument is that there exists mechanisms for whistleblowers to raise concerns about sensitive national security programs.\xc2\xa0 Releasing details of sensitive national security programs on the Internet for everyone, including our adversaries, to see is inconsistent with those protocols that are established for protecting whistleblowers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:09 P.M.
