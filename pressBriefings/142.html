Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:57 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe we should -- apparently, this Royals mug is lucky for the Chiefs, as well.\xc2\xa0 So certainly enjoyed the victory over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Well, Senator Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s hometown teams are now 0 and 2 against my hometown teams in the playoffs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooooh --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ouch!</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The good news is that Calgary Flames can rest easy because Kansas City doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a hockey team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re liking the sports --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m excited.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the Monday before the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 A little fired up, ready to go!\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have an opening announcement, so we can go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKathleen, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to start with the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 I guess we\'ll get to that.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with Sean Penn\xe2\x80\x99s interview with El Chapo.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- made a little news this weekend, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us whether or not the President has read it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to the President about the Rolling Stone interview.\xc2\xa0 I have read a little bit about the interview, but I haven\'t actually read the interview myself.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is -- the capture of Mr. Guzman has been a high priority both for Mexico and the United States.\xc2\xa0 Mexican authorities have been aggressive about looking for Mr. Guzman and bringing him into custody.\xc2\xa0 We obviously commend the Mexican authorities for their success and we obviously salute the law enforcement officials in that country that have spent a lot of time and worked quite bravely to ensure that he can be brought to justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\'re going to continue to work with Mexico and other partners around the world to respond to the threats that are posed by transnational criminal organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a report this actually may take up to a year.\xc2\xa0 Is that an acceptable time period?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Department of Justice for sort of the tick-tock on how the process works.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak about any specific case.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the standard operating procedure is that if there is an individual who is facing charges in the United States that is arrested overseas, then the extradition process commences.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Mr. Guzman is facing some serious charges here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 But for details about sort of where things stand in that process or what that process looks like, I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the reports that the Mexican government will be investing Sean Penn about the interview -- do you have any details on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any details about that.\xc2\xa0 But you can obviously contact Mexican authorities about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I wanted to ask you -- you talked a little bit about the deportation raids that happened over the holiday weekend.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a lot of Democratic lawmakers on the Hill that are very upset about this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask the administration to grant temporary protective status for some of these people.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering what your reaction is to that.\xc2\xa0 It sounded like you\'re not inclined to change the policy in any way.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 At this point, our policy will remain the same.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that given the sensitivity of this issue, it\'s worth me spending at least a little time here just reminding people what our policy is.\xc2\xa0 When the President put in place -- used his executive authority to try to reform as much of the immigration system as he could, using only his executive authority, that included the Department of Homeland Security implementing some prosecutorial discretion, some guidance that would be used to prioritize for removal those individuals who don\'t have the legal basis for remaining in the country but yet are accused of crimes.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve also prioritized for removal those individuals who have only recently crossed the border.\xc2\xa0 And the idea here is that we should prioritize felons -- the deportation of felons over the separation of families.\xc2\xa0 And given the limited law enforcement resources that we have to work with, that\'s a rather common-sense proposition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe individuals who were involved in some of the operations that have gotten a lot of attention fell into the category broadly -- fell into the category of people who\xe2\x80\x99d recently crossed the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is even for those individuals that are prioritized for removal, those individuals, though, are still given access to the justice system and given access to due process.\xc2\xa0 And the administration is committed to that process.\xc2\xa0 In fact, part of our response to the surge that we saw at the border about a year and a half ago was to actually increase the amount of resources that are devoted to that justice process.\xc2\xa0 So this is a system of due process that we take quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 And it was only after individuals had exhausted the legal remedies available to them to claim asylum or to be granted some other form of humanitarian relief, only then was the decision made to remove them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the White House\xe2\x80\x99s level of involvement in that decision -- in these specific operations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 These are enforcement operations, so this is consistent with the kind of prosecutorial guidance that\'s been put in place by the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 But obviously executing these enforcement actions are the responsibility of law enforcement professionals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no one at the White House was notified that this was going to happen in advance?\xc2\xa0 Or, I mean, was there some notification?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t speak to any sort of communication that takes place between the Department of Homeland Security and the White House.\xc2\xa0 But for decisions like this and decisions to move forward with operations, those are obviously decisions that are, appropriately, made by law enforcement professionals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, is it accurate then to describe this as part of the broader attempt to prevent another crisis like we saw in 2014?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think our desire to make clear that individuals should not embark on the dangerous journey from Central America to the Southwest border, that\'s the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to tell in a variety of ways, including by saying publicly that people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt this journey and they certainly shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t entrust their children into the hands of unscrupulous human traffickers to make that journey.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration has also cracked down on human traffickers that have preyed upon people who are in a rather desperate situation.\xc2\xa0 The administration has also invested in trying to enhance the resources that are available to governments in Central America like Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, to help them better account for the security situation in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the administration sought a billion dollars in funding that could be used to work with the governments down there to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 Congress did appropriate $750 million for that task.\xc2\xa0 We obviously were pleased to see that commitment from Congress to this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere also has been an effort underway to establish alternative paths for those individuals that have legitimate humanitarian and asylum claims that they can -- essentially we wanted to establish a process that would make it easier for these individuals to have those claims heard without them embarking on this dangerous journey.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe real tragedy here is that there are far too many men, women and children that have attempted this journey.\xc2\xa0 Many of them have been killed.\xc2\xa0 Others have been victimized in terrible ways when they have sought to embark on that journey.\xc2\xa0 And so that is what we are trying to prevent.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to confront this challenge.\xc2\xa0 And those efforts only attract some attention, I think, when there\xe2\x80\x99s a surge at the border or there are some enforcement actions.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you that since the summer of 2014, this is something that has been part of an intense focus by the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going to the State of the Union, the White House has said repeatedly that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a laundry list of proposals, but will the President lay out any concrete legislative goals for the year?\xc2\xa0 And what should the American people kind of read into that?\xc2\xa0 Should they not expect any big legislative accomplishments this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ayesha, traditionally, the State of the Union is an opportunity for the President of the United States to speak before the Congress and the American people about all that\xe2\x80\x99s been accomplished and all that the President hopes to accomplish in the year ahead.\xc2\xa0 And you certainly will hear some of that from the President tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s main focus will be on the opportunities and challenges that are facing the country not just in the year ahead, but what\xe2\x80\x99s critical are the kinds of decisions that we make now will have a significant impact on not just the next generation of Americans but future generations of Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is certainly a lot that we have to get done over the course of the next year.\xc2\xa0 That includes criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that there is strong bipartisan support for criminal justice reform on Capitol Hill, and the White House has worked hard to try to nurture the bipartisan agreement that will be required to pass that legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are hopeful that Congress will take steps to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 This was an agreement that was reached by the United States and 11 other countries in the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 This is an agreement that we spent years negotiating.\xc2\xa0 We were pleased to see this agreement completed.\xc2\xa0 And now we need to see Congress vote to ratify it.\xc2\xa0 There is a process, though, of public consideration and public comment, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not calling on Congress to vote for it now, but we are hopeful that they will move in a timely fashion to vote to approve that legislation.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is going to require bipartisan support there, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are just two examples of some high-priority items that the President is hopeful this Congress can act on before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moving on to the -- in light of the North Korean nuclear test, the U.S. and South Korea have been discussing the deployment of more strategic weapons in the area, and also there was a flyover of a B-52 bomber, I believe, over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And so China has raised some concerns, calling for all sides to avoid escalating the situation in the region.\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering, did the U.S. talk to China at all before they did the flyover?\xc2\xa0 And are there any concerns, when you\xe2\x80\x99re discussing deployment of more strategic weapons, about possibly escalating the situation or making the situation worse?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me tell you a little bit about -- let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The United States has obviously been closely consulting with our partners and allies in the region in terms of putting together a response to the provocative actions that we saw from the North Koreans last week.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry and Secretary Carter have been in touch with a number of their counterparts in the region.\xc2\xa0 Even President Obama called his counterparts in Japan and South Korea in the aftermath of North Korea testing this nuclear device.\xc2\xa0 So we have been consulting quite closely with our partners and allies.\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention the Security Council meeting at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 So we are committed to preserving the international unanimity of opinion when it comes to confronting North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And that will only strengthen our hand in this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, we have indicated that there are a variety of appropriate responses, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue the work to develop those responses.\xc2\xa0 We also, however, are committed to this safety and security of our close allies in South Korea.\xc2\xa0 And there obviously are men and women of the United States military who are deployed to South Korea.\xc2\xa0 They are, I think, the most graphic representation of that -- or manifestation of that commitment.\xc2\xa0 There are also resources that are deployed through the Asia Pacific that are critical to protecting the United States homeland.\xc2\xa0 And this is technology that can be used to counter North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly will take the steps that we believe are necessary to protect the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had a couple of things following off that.\xc2\xa0 One is North Korea announced today that it had arrested an American citizen on espionage charges.\xc2\xa0 There seemed to be some debate about whether or not he is, in fact, a citizen.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can confirm that, and if you guys are taking any steps to try to work towards his return?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say before, this is report that we have seen, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a report that I can comment on.\xc2\xa0 Talking publicly about possible cases of detained Americans can complicate our efforts to try to secure their freedom.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s just not much I can say about these reports.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if there is a point where there is more that we can say, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry is going to meet with his Russian counterpart, presumably to discuss North Korea, among the litany of other issues that the U.S. and Russia have kind of going on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- are there any plans for the President to call President Putin?\xc2\xa0 If not, why not, since he\xe2\x80\x99s reached out to the leaders of Japan and South Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any calls like that that are on the agenda in the short term at least.\xc2\xa0 If that changes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously let you know.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, there are a variety of other U.S. officials that have been in touch with the relevant parties here.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s determined that President Obama needs to communicate with President Putin about this, then he won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to pick up the phone and call.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration hoping for out of that conversation between Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lavrov?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have the rundown on their agenda.\xc2\xa0 Presumably, there are a number of things that they will discuss, including efforts to advance the long overdue political transition inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Russia has got an important role to play there.\xc2\xa0 We welcome their constructive contribution to that effort thus far, and we hope that that will continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, there is some ongoing work to implement the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Russia has been a constructive supporter of that process.\xc2\xa0 So for a more detailed rundown on the agenda, though, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you mentioned Iran, last week you said you didn\'t have an update on Iranian sanctions relief, but President Rouhani said today, kind of echoing Secretary Kerry, that he expects sanctions relief to begin in the next few days.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\'s an accurate timeline, and if this is something that\'s you guys are preparing, or if you have any update on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the pressure is on the Iranians to deliver at this point.\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that the international community and certainly not the United States, we\'re not going to provide relief from sanctions to the Iranians until they have taken the steps that are described in the agreement to dismantle large portions of their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, we\'re not just going to take their word for it. We actually will have international inspectors who can verify that Iran has followed through in carrying out the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to carry out.</p>\n<p>\n\tIran has made some progress, to their credit.\xc2\xa0 A couple weeks ago, they shipped 25,000 pound of enriched uranium out of the country.\xc2\xa0 That is consistent with the commitment that they have made to reduce their uranium stockpile by 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 There are also specific requirements around the heavy-water reactor that they operate around Arak.\xc2\xa0 They are required to remove the core of the reactor and fill it with concrete to ensure that it can be rendered -- to essentially render it harmless.\xc2\xa0 This would shut down the plutonium path to a nuclear weapon that we believe Iran had been pursuing.\xc2\xa0 But there are whole steps related to centrifuges and other things.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce Iran has taken all those steps, and once the international community, through the IAEA, has been able to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement, then, and only then, will Iran begin receiving the sanctions relief that we know they seek.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is that verification possible in the next few days, the next week?\xc2\xa0 Or is that something that you\'re envisioning still months away?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to depend on Iran and when they complete implementing the provisions of the agreement. Obviously we have a robust infrastructure in place to verify their compliance with the agreement -- not just at the beginning, but on an ongoing basis.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the IAEA for a better assessment of how long that process will actually take.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I actually didn\'t have a question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I saw your hand up earlier.\xc2\xa0 I was just trying to move it around here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you called on me, though, I\xe2\x80\x99ll dredge up two.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 One is, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a little weird to watch television today and see all this coverage of the Powerball jackpot as large as it is.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- how does the President feel about the message that Americans really should go out and buy these tickets?\xc2\xa0 That\'s the unmistakable takeaway from the cheerleading on TV for this giant lottery jackpot.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the other is, of course, the passing of David Bowie -- any reaction from you or the President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Justin asked my Iran question, so I got to go with something else.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 These are just the two topics on your mind today, huh?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just back from vacation.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t help it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that the President has purchased a Powerball ticket.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess I didn\'t win on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But you know what I mean about the policy aspect of this, right?\xc2\xa0 This is a voluntary but regressive tax on Americans.\xc2\xa0 How does he feel about this as a matter of public policy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a decision that states make.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of states who benefit from participating on these kinds of games and it\xe2\x80\x99s a source of revenue that they benefit from.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, the American people can decide sort of how best to spend their money.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the odds are long of winning, but people can sort of make up their own minds about whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to spend their hard-earned dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it comes to David Bowie, I think the way that his loss will be felt I think is illustrated by the pretty broad outpouring of reaction to his death.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of people all across the globe who talked about they had been inspired by his life and his work.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about whether or not he was a David Bowie fan, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the impact of his contribution to art and music and film not just here in the United States but around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, a quick follow-up to something on Friday, the attempted assassination of the police officer in Philadelphia. Does the White House consider that a terrorist attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, this is something that is still being investigated by the Philadelphia Police Department and they have not concluded that it actually is an act of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 But given some of the circumstances of the event, obviously that is something that we\'re all wondering right now.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident that as the Philadelphia Police Department investigates the shooting of one of their own this is something they will consider -- that\'s specifically the motivation of the individual who carried out this heinous act of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously are pleased to hear reports that the condition of the police officer is improving.\xc2\xa0 And again, it is a timely reminder of the way that hundreds of thousands of police officers across the country put on their uniform and leave home every day prepared to put their lives on the line to protect the communities they\xe2\x80\x99re sworn to serve and protect.\xc2\xa0 And the overwhelming majority of those individuals carry out that important work with courage and with professionalism.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously owe them a debt of gratitude.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a question on the state of the Union, literally.\xc2\xa0 The President has said he\xe2\x80\x99s never been more optimistic going into a new year.\xc2\xa0 How do you square that with where the American public is on that question?\xc2\xa0 The most recent poll from NBC had just a fifth of the country saying the country was on the right track, 70 percent saying that the country is going on the wrong track.\xc2\xa0 Why, if the President is so optimistic about the state of the Union, why did the overwhelming majority of the American public believe that things are seriously off the rails?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think part of that, Jon, is obviously attributable to the avalanche of negativity that we\'ve seen from the Republican candidates for president, the kind of -- the willingness of those candidates to exploit people\xe2\x80\x99s fears and insecurities and anxieties has infected the political debate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s surely part of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\'s perfectly reasonable, as the President discussed in his interview with Steve Inskeep before the end of the year, that there are a lot of Americans who are feeling insecure about the economy.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, given the terrorist attack that we saw in San Bernardino at the end of last year, people are understandably concerned about national security and it sort of reawakened people\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about that.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly reason for people to be concerned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that, though, is that he has never been more confident about our ability to confront successfully those challenges, but also never been more confident about our capacity to capitalize on the opportunities that exist for this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I want to ask you -- so you have the President saying he\xe2\x80\x99s never been more optimistic, and Denis McDonough, yesterday in his interviews, struck a similarly optimistic tone about where things stand right now.\xc2\xa0 Donald Trump says the state of the Union is a mess.\xc2\xa0 It seems that the vast majority of the American people think that Trump is right on that question and not the President.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?\xc2\xa0 Is it really just because of what Republican candidates have been saying in a primary?\xc2\xa0 You think the American people have been fooled by that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly had an impact on the nature of the political debate in this country.\xc2\xa0 But again, I also think that there are justified concerns about the impact of the global economy on middle-class families here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I think there is a justified concern about the ability of ISIL to use social media to carry out acts of violence against Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe bottom line, though, when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about all of this is he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of confidence that betting on America is going to be a good bet, both in terms of confronting those challenges but also in terms of capitalizing on those opportunities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is hopeful that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity in the speech to not just talk about the kind of political rhetoric that is on display from Republicans leading up to the next election but to actually talk about how these issues are going to affect the next generation of Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what leadership is about.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is consistent with the kind of leadership that the President campaigned on in 2007 and 2008, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kind of leadership that the President has shown since he took office for the first time in January of 2009.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, following on Olivier, on Powerball -- (laughter) -- no, but I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious question, and going back on -- okay, let me hit Powerball first.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0No, seriously.\xc2\xa0 Granted, it\xe2\x80\x99s gambling, but it\xe2\x80\x99s over $1 billion -- the jackpot is over $1 billion.\xc2\xa0 And lotteries were typically sanctioned by governments -- well, approved by governments for infrastructure projects, facilities, and state projects.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does that say something that -- granted, a lot of people are gambling, looking to get this big jackpot so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to work anymore -- or work anymore, but there could be a benefit.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does the White House look at it as a possible boon for states and localities that do have Powerball in that location?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me what sort of impact this particular game will have on state budgets across the country.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of Americans are talking about this because it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they do it because they expect that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to win and they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have to show up to work the next day.\xc2\xa0 I think they do it because they think it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of state governments see this as an opportunity to try to make a little money -- yes, to augment funding for infrastructure projects, or education, or other priorities that they\xe2\x80\x99ve identified.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\'t heard the President express a particular objection to that.\xc2\xa0 So I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there needs to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask state governments about that.\xc2\xa0 And I think what they would tell you is that this is helpful in helping them fund the kinds of priorities that they\xe2\x80\x99ve identified, particularly in this era of fiscal belt-tightening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now on to the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us a little tick-tock as to how many drafts, how long will it take?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a metric to share with you in terms of the number of drafts that the President has gone through.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President, in addition to a round a golf, devoted a significant portion of his weekend to working on the speech.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule has been left pretty flexible today so that he can spend ample time working on it again.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that there will be even more work that\xe2\x80\x99s done tonight and tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The President typically is working on the State of the Union pretty close -- up to the last minute, and i would anticipate that that will be true this year, as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, when the President delivers the State of the Union, talking about the state of the union -- it\xe2\x80\x99s either strong or he\xe2\x80\x99s optimistic or what have you -- typically, every year, when a President does this, it\xe2\x80\x99s a statement of optimism, resilience, and strength.\xc2\xa0 And then you have people like Donald Trump saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a mess.\xc2\xa0 But when any President delivers a State of the Union, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there positives in the country and negatives?\xc2\xa0 What would you say to this State of the Union as you have Republicans saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a mess and looking at the negatives when this administration is tallying positives as well as the negatives?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President has ample reason to be quite optimistic about the capacity of the American people to confront the significant challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s optimism about the country is not because he isn\xe2\x80\x99t concerned about the future.\xc2\xa0 His optimism about the country is characterized by his confidence in the American people and our country to overcome those challenges, and, just as importantly, to capitalize on the opportunities that exist.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no country in the world that is better positioned to capitalize on the kind of opportunities we see -- whether it relates to our national security or it relates to our economy -- than the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the opportunity tomorrow to hear directly from the President about why exactly that is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 Since this is more of a visionary statement, we\xe2\x80\x99re at a time where we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some very divisive words about race.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it from Justice Scalia, in many people\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it from the Governor of New Hampshire just in the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 Will the President address these --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You mean the Governor of Maine.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Forgive me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on vacation.\xc2\xa0 Yeah, but we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it from -- seeing these words from officials who lead or judge in some shape or form in this United States system.\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, stay tuned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give me more than that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not today.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Congress is considering a package of changes to the Freedom of Information law, which would basically codify the presumption of openness and strengthen the office responsible for oversight of FOIA issues.\xc2\xa0 It has bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Does it have the White House\xe2\x80\x99s support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously take a close look at the legislation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that I\xe2\x80\x99m confident they could do that would strengthen this proposal -- you think you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Include themselves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 And I would expect that the press corps that spends so much time covering Congress and covering government and demanding transparency would have those same kinds of questions for Congress.\xc2\xa0 Congress is the one writing the rules.\xc2\xa0 And right now they\'re writing the rules in such a way that they don\'t have to play by them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s particularly a, frankly, American way to pursue this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of our government is about making sure that we\'re all playing by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 And the basis of this legislation is that the American people have a right to know more about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening inside their government.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand why Congress doesn\'t think the American people don\'t have a right to understand exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly would encourage them to consider adding that to their proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s views on this, we feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty strong record.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just walk through a couple of highlights.\xc2\xa0 In fiscal year 2014, the administration processed 647,142 FOIA requests.\xc2\xa0 That number of letters doesn\'t get responded to unless you\'re serious about trying to fulfill your responsibility to run the most transparent government in history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore than 91 percent of the FOIA requests that were processed by the administration resulted in the person making the request receiving some or all of the requested information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut part of our commitment to transparency is actually reflected in our efforts to put out information before we\'re even asked about it.\xc2\xa0 And if you visit data.gov -- which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure all of you have done -- there are more than 180,000 data sets and collections that have been made available on data.gov.\xc2\xa0 And consistent with our commitment to transparency, the administration has said that that information should be presented in machine-readable format so that when you\'re considering those data sets, you can slice and dice the numbers and actually help the American people learn a little bit more about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in their government and in their world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so these are some of the reasons that we obviously are quite proud of the work that we have done to make government more transparent and more accessible, and wish that Congress, while they\'re writing these rules, would follow suit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A House panel concluded -- a Republican-led House panel concluded in a recent report that the entire FOIA process is \xe2\x80\x9cbroken,\xe2\x80\x9d and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some really high profile incidents of this at the State Department, for example, over Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record and the fact that there are I think a couple dozen lawsuits against the agency over that.\xc2\xa0 But there have also been questions raised about transparency at other agencies and parts of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 Has -- you rattle off some statistics -- but as a philosophical question, has access to information gotten better during the Obama administration?\xc2\xa0 Have these agencies lived up to their responsibilities and the standard you set as the most transparency administration in history?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no denying that we have made improvements in a way that have led people to have a better understanding of exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in their government and making their government more transparent.\xc2\xa0 And that includes releasing a whole lot of information even before we\'re asked.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- let me give you another example of that.\xc2\xa0 On a regular basis, the White House puts out a list of just about everybody who visits the White House. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that the previous administration went to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the release of that information.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that we release on a voluntary basis on a regular schedule.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, our record on this is good and transparency has improved.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me also state that the commitment to transparency means constantly working to improve that process even more.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that those of you who are advocates for transparency believe that there is a lot more that we can and should be doing to provide more information and we certainly do strive to live up to the goal that the President -- the ambitious goal that the President set at the beginning to ensure that he\xe2\x80\x99s presiding over the most transparent White House in history, and that those kinds of -- that that commitment to transparency also extends to a variety of government agencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when it comes to the State Department, yes, there have been some disputes about this.\xc2\xa0 But again, I would encourage you to take a look at the results, which is that you have the former Secretary of State releasing all of her work-related emails, consistent with the FOIA process.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think the outcome here is evidence of the kind of commitment to transparency that the President has championed.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you mentioned visits to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Denis McDonough said that Senator Sanders had had a visit with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was a private meeting, so not very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was it -- you know when it was?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have details about when the meeting took place, but the President has had an opportunity -- has had multiple opportunities, both in private, one-on-one interactions, as well as in interactions with the broader Senate Democratic caucus, to visit with Senator Sanders.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out future sit-downs in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why did Denis -- and I think you did this a little bit on Friday -- why are you guys taking credit for Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 movement on gun control?\xc2\xa0 And do you also believe that Secretary Clinton has maybe moved in your direction a little bit because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions on guns over the years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the reason is that when the President published an op-ed suggesting that he would only support candidates who share his commitment to common-sense gun safety laws that we saw Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 office indicate that Senator Sanders has said that he was more open to those kinds of laws than he had been in the past.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a direct quote, but I think that\'s consistent with the spirit of what they have said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you think they did that because of the op-ed, because of the concern that maybe President Obama would not campaign for Senator Sanders in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him about that.\xc2\xa0 I think the point --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he would need President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s assistance up in Vermont were he running for reelection for a Senate seat, for example?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- I don\'t have to tell you this\xc2\xa0 -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not running for reelection as senator, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually running for President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that whoever the Democratic nominee is, they\'re going to be pretty eager to have President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xc2\xa0 So I can certainly understand why this is something that Senator Sanders is talking about quite a bit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it was necessary movement on his part?\xc2\xa0 Is the President pleased that Senator Sanders has moved in his direction since the publication of that op-ed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we saw some pretty direct comments from Senator Sanders over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 I understand he did a town hall meeting or some sort of public event in Iowa where he noted that he supports changing laws that currently allow gun manufacturers who have acted irresponsibly to avoid accountability.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that the opposite should be true, that gun manufacturers should be held accountable for their products and for their business practices, and we obviously were pleased to see Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s consistent with the kinds of values and priorities that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see from candidates that the President is prepared to campaign for next year -- or later this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to help Hillary Clinton a little bit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of discussion about it on the Sunday talk shows.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It sounds like I spent the last like 90 seconds talking -- saying good things about Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to common-sense gun laws, so I have a feeling I\xe2\x80\x99m more likely to hear from my friends in the Clinton campaign than my friends in the Sanders campaign right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I bet the folks in the Clinton campaign would probably like it if you were saying that we\'re glad we got Senator Sanders to move in our direction a little bit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that we were pleased to see his comments over the weekend and they are certainly consistent with the kinds of priorities that we would expect candidates who are seeking the President\xe2\x80\x99s support to prioritize on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 And the President is quite serious about this.\xc2\xa0 If there are Democratic candidates who aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to walk the walk and live up to a commitment to advancing common-sense gun laws, then they should look elsewhere for support for their campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you about this last State of Union.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that after the State of Union, the public\xe2\x80\x99s focus will shift away from the White House and to the campaign trail, and folks aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay attention to what you\'re doing anymore and that sort of thing?\xc2\xa0 And how are you planning to deal with that?\xc2\xa0 You\'re still working for the President of the United States, so you got that going on for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s certainly true.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern?\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I got a lot of people asking me this question back in November of 2014, after Democrats had been beaten badly in the midterm election.\xc2\xa0 And there were a lot of questions about whether or not the President was going to be able to, A, stay relevant; and B, advance his agenda.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you take a look at all that we accomplished over the course of the last year -- reaching an international agreement on climate change; reaching an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and Republicans not being able to even muster a vote of disapproval in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 We advanced the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to negotiate trade agreements that we believe will have long-term positive consequences for our economy.\xc2\xa0 We passed a budget agreement that included an additional $50 billion over and above sequester levels to ensure we\'re adequately funding our economic and national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reauthorized the Export-Import Bank.\xc2\xa0 We finally long overdue reform of the IMF through.\xc2\xa0 We got a transportation bill done that guaranteed five years of funding.\xc2\xa0 We believe there\xe2\x80\x99s more funding that should be done, but getting a five-year commitment to that funding is important.\xc2\xa0 We reformed the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Child Left Behind\xe2\x80\x9d law so we can make sure that students aren\xe2\x80\x99t facing too much testing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd all of that happened since many pundits were prepared to say the President was irrelevant and unable to advance his agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the -- you made this announcement earlier about SnapChat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to be doing on Snapchat?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is he going to Snapchat with Hillary Clinton?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The messages disappear.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I missed a good one.\xc2\xa0 What did I miss?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She made that remarks in the past that the messages disappear.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check the tape.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what she likes about Snapchat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Look, we have unveiled the White House Snapchat function.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are hopeful that people will take a look at it and follow the White House.\xc2\xa0 It is just another tool for us to try to communicate with the American public about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd apropos of Byron\xe2\x80\x99s question, I am confident that we will ensure that even though the Snapchat messages disappear, that they are properly recorded for posterity\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They will be archived.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They will be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Snapchat is aware of that, I guess.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work this out with them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly how, but we have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how it works either.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, good.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to what you said earlier about GOP candidates were shaping the mindset of some Americans with an \xe2\x80\x9cavalanche of negativity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President see the State of the Union tomorrow as his chance to burnish his legacy and set the stage for a Democrat to follow him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President sees this as an opportunity to talk to the country bluntly about the challenges that we face and the opportunities that are there for the taking, and if we\'re going to successfully confront these challenges, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we understand exactly what they are.\xc2\xa0 So you will hear the President talk about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll also hear the President talk about why he is so confident about our ability to meet those challenges.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the opportunities that are available for the taking for the United States, no country in the world is better positioned to capitalize on those opportunities than the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that ultimately is the essence of the message that the President wants to deliver, precisely because the next president needs to understand that and the American people need to understand that.\xc2\xa0 They need to have an accurate assessment of what our challenges are, what the risks are out there, but also have an adequate understanding of what opportunities are available so that we don\'t miss them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we are at a critical juncture in our history.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve spent seven years digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And thanks primarily to the grit and determination of the American people and American entrepreneurs and American innovators, we\'ve made a lot of progress -- such that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 economy is now the envy of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the question is, where do we go from here?\xc2\xa0 What do we do to make sure that we can lock in prosperity for future generations of Americans, but also make sure that that prosperity is shared not just with those at the top, but with middle-class families and those families that are working really hard to try to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the essence of the message that the President wants to deliver.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m confident he\'ll deliver it much more articulately than I just have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the \xe2\x80\x9cavalanche of negativity,\xe2\x80\x9d as you said, and given the approval ratings of where they are, would you say the President feels like he needs to be on the offensive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President feels like this is a good opportunity, when you have the attention of the Congress and the American people, to help people understand this case.\xc2\xa0 Look, if the President wanted to give a speech about what the President has been able to do over the last seven years, we\xe2\x80\x99d have plenty to talk about.\xc2\xa0 But the President is delivering a speech that\'s not about him; it\'s about the American people and about the future of our country, and about how our kids and their kids are going to fare.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he understands quite clearly that the kinds of decisions that he will make over the course of the next year and that the next president will have to make during their tenure in office will have a substantial impact on whether or not we pass on a country to the next generation of Americans that is as strong, that is as secure, that is as prosperous and is as fair as the United States has ever been.\xc2\xa0 That is a tremendous opportunity that we have, but it is directly contingent on the kinds of decisions that we make right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the stakes are high, and, frankly, the stakes are higher than any one president or any one Congress.\xc2\xa0 But they will have a long-term impact on the kind of country that we pass on to future generations of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This will be Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s first State of the Union as Speaker.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\'ll enjoy the view from the great front-row seat that he\'ll have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does the President see this as sort of a fresh start with Congress?\xc2\xa0 Or is one of the reasons why he\xe2\x80\x99s not walking in with this laundry list of legislative items because he knows he can\'t really get anything done, regardless of who the Speaker is with the Congress he\xe2\x80\x99s facing now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that we\'ve been able to get done just since Paul Ryan entered his office a couple of months ago.\xc2\xa0 Many of the things that I talked about in answering Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question related to IMF reform and reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, and a budget agreement that includes a bunch of the priorities that we\'ve long championed -- a transportation deal, \xe2\x80\x9cNo Child Left Behind\xe2\x80\x9d legislation -- all of that was work that we were able to do by trying to find common ground with Paul Ryan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe certainly don\'t agree with him -- President Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him on every issue.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even sure we agree on most issues.\xc2\xa0 But there is common ground that can be found.\xc2\xa0 And by seizing that common ground we can do something good for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And so the President is optimistic that we\'ll be able to continue to work constructively with Speaker Ryan in the year that remains in the Obama presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that the President will once again pledge and promise that he will shut down Guantanamo Bay?\xc2\xa0 Today I believe is the 14-year anniversary.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t succeeded in doing so at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know exactly how the President will discuss this in his speech.\xc2\xa0 To go back to April\xe2\x80\x99s question, I anticipate that there will be more than one draft between now and 9:00 p.m. tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 But regardless of how the President talks about this in the speech, I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to achieving that national security priority is as strong as ever.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it often gets lost in the political debate, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is in our national security interest is a view that is shared not just by Democratic foreign policy experts, but even by Republican foreign policy experts that served the previous President, and include the previous President.\xc2\xa0 So this is something the President is going to keep fighting for over the course of the next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been three detainees released over about the past week to 10 days.\xc2\xa0 So is this chipping away at the detainee population the most the President can get done at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this chipping away at the population -- that included the announcement from the Department of Defense just this morning that an additional Gitmo detainee had been transferred to Saudi Arabia -- certainly is what we can do right now.\xc2\xa0 And we have made some progress in reducing the population at the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, to accomplish the goal of closing it, we\'re going to need Congress to remove some obstacles that have prevented it thus far.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And congrats on your Chiefs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to begin by asking about Officer Hartnett in Philadelphia.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House in any way reached out to him directly?\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in contact with him at all, and is there a plan to do so?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that White House officials have been in touch with officials in Philadelphia.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any personal contact with the officer at this point.\xc2\xa0 Last I heard, he was still in the hospital.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly are closely monitoring this case, and Officer Hartnett has certainly been on the hearts and minds of everybody here at the White House, including the President and the First Lady.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier that because the Philadelphia Police Department and others are still working on this that you couldn\'t make necessarily a terror designation meaning, despite the fact that this particular perpetrator claimed to be a devotee of ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Has that changed at all?\xc2\xa0 Are you not feeling like that is something that would push you closer to making the declarative statement that this was obviously something that was terror related?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, obviously those reports lead us to worry that this could be an act of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that\'s part of the ongoing investigation that\'s being led by the Philadelphia Police Department right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe FBI has been supporting that investigation and there obviously is keen interest in trying to understand what may have motivated this individual to carry out this deplorable act of violence.\xc2\xa0 And it is relevant whether or not this individual was motivated by demons inside of his own mind, or by demons that he encountered through social media.\xc2\xa0 And either way, we want to make sure that we are mindful of the steps that we can take to mitigate the risk that is posed by this individual or others like him across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCertainly one thing that we can do is to keep guns out of the hands of people like him.\xc2\xa0 And somebody who is planning to carry out a terrorist act or somebody who has significant mental problems is something who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to so easily get their hands on a gun.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re pretty mindful of that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you, speaking out about the State of the Union, could you maybe give me three words to describe -- I know it\'s a bit of a preview -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s intentions in this year\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if I can shrink it down to three words, but I can certainly tell you that the President intends to use this opportunity to convey his optimism about the future of the country and to convey his optimism about the ability of this country to confront the challenges that are ahead of us, but also to capitalize on the opportunities that are there for the take.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you expect him to acknowledge some of the promises that have not yet been fulfilled, as well, including closing the prison at Guantanamo, including ending the war in Afghanistan, maybe even comprehensive reform on immigration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, some of those things that you mentioned are things that haven\'t happened because they were specifically blocked by members of Congress, and at least one of them was something that was blocked by Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the President can be held accountable for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut surely the President -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you watch the speech tomorrow and conclude for yourself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I understand that you say that this is not a political document, but do you deny that part of the aim, at least, is to help whoever the Democratic candidate is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I think what is clear is that those who are closely following this election -- presumably that includes all of you, but also includes many Americans -- will take in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in the political context in which he\xe2\x80\x99s giving it.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.\xc2\xa0 But the President is actually going to try to do something tomorrow that he regularly challenges Washington politicians to do, which is to look beyond the next election and actually consider the fate of the next generation of Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s really on his mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tWill there be candidates in either party -- some Republican candidates trying to use this to advance their campaigns?\xc2\xa0 Will there be Democratic candidates for President trying to use the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to advance their campaigns?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will happen.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure that\'s inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not what\xe2\x80\x99s motivating the President of the United States right now.\xc2\xa0 What this President has the opportunity to do -- because he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ballot for the next election -- he\xe2\x80\x99s got an opportunity to lay out for the American people the longer-term challenges that we face, but also the longer-term opportunities that exist.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if our goal really is to pass on an America that is stronger, more secure, and more prosperous to not just the next generation of Americans but to the kids of the next generation of Americans, then the decisions that we make today matter.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is mindful of every day in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow will be an opportunity for giving the American people the opportunity to get a little behind-the-scenes look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ballot, but his legacy is.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s got this -- you\'ve all stated and he has stated that your goal is to get a Democrat elected so that his policies will not be under threat; that some of the important things that you feel that have happened over the course of the last seven years will continue.\xc2\xa0 So at least in that context, is this a political speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I am not confident that -- the President certainly does want a successor who has the same set of priorities that he does and is interested in trying to build on the important progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years. That certainly is something that the President is interested in. But again, the speech the President will give tomorrow will be focused less on the next election and much more on the interests of the next generation of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the humanitarian crisis in the Syrian town on the Lebanese border and the concern by some humanitarian groups about what is causing that?\xc2\xa0 Doctors Without Borders now says at least in one of their clinics, 28 people, including six babies, have been killed.\xc2\xa0 And the suggestion has been made that part of what\xe2\x80\x99s motivating it is, frankly, a failure of international powers who have been looking to get the warring factions to come to the negotiating table and, as a result, are kind of ignoring international law.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that the efforts to end the war there are actually contributing to the humanitarian crisis?\xc2\xa0 And what are the White House\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts overall about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the situation that we see in these graphic images and what you\'ve just described are no less than heartbreaking.\xc2\xa0 And these are innocent Syrians who are caught in the middle of terrible chaos and terrible violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of the people that are in the towns that are actually getting some humanitarian relief today are people who live in towns that have been besieged by the Assad regime for years.\xc2\xa0 And some of these communities are actually communities where the Assad regime had claimed to implement a ceasefire months ago, but yet it\xe2\x80\x99s still a dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the latest example of the terrible conduct of the Assad regime and the willingness of the Assad regime to use violence against the people that they\'re supposed to be governing and looking out for.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are some estimates that there are about 400,000 people inside of Syria that are still besieged right now.\xc2\xa0 And that is precisely why we are working so aggressively in the international community to try to bring about this political transition that\'s long overdue inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately this failed political system which is the direct result of Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership that has led to this problem.\xc2\xa0 And so the sooner we can bring about that political transition, the sooner we can start to address these challenges at their root.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you reject the idea that perhaps inadvertently international efforts to intervene there are exacerbating the problem?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will admit I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely familiar with the argument that some are making here.\xc2\xa0 Our view is that we should be doing as much as we can to provide humanitarian relief to those who are suffering.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has done more than any other country to provide the kind of relief both to other countries in the region who are housing refugees, but also to those relief organizations that are providing humanitarian relief inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we know that there are a number of U.N.-affiliated agencies in the Red Cross that are doing heroic work to respond to this situation, and the United States has been providing financial support to those efforts.\xc2\xa0 They matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, ultimately, to solve this problem, we have to bring about a political transition inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 President Bashar al-Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0We believe he should leave and a government that is prepared to unite Syria and to govern consistent with the will and ambition of the Syrian people should take power.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not going to happen overnight.\xc2\xa0 This is painstaking work.\xc2\xa0 And we have been focused on this for a long time, and a lot of people have died while we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that either.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re working as aggressively as we can because we\'re mindful of the very real human toll that this situation is having on a whole lot of innocent people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a real quick one, if I can, on El Chapo.\xc2\xa0 And you praised the Mexican officials for what they did in the capture.\xc2\xa0 And at least one Mexican official has been pretty widely quoted as saying that they knew about the meeting between him and Sean Penn.\xc2\xa0 And I just wonder if you can give us any background leading up to this -- how closely the White House was following it, if the President was being briefed on it, and if the United States knew -- if you know if the United States knew about this meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a lot of information about what exactly led to Mr. Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s capture.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously an effort that was led by Mexican authorities, that they\xe2\x80\x99d been working basically around the clock on since he escaped.\xc2\xa0 And this is not just a priority of the Mexican government.\xc2\xa0 It had been a priority of the U.S. government, too.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re obviously pleased to see the success that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in bringing him into custody and placing him under arrest.\xc2\xa0 But for sort of the tick-tock of all this, I just don\'t have a lot of details for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tGregory.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is the State of Union address still as relevant as it used to be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s an open-ended, philosophical question, I guess.\xc2\xa0 I guess, thinking about it for four seconds, the answer to that question is yes.\xc2\xa0 I think in a political environment in which there is so much debate and so many opportunities for various candidates and others with a political agenda to make their views known on whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Snapchat or something else -- that having a moment that we all acknowledge that for an hour, one day a year, the President of the United States, whoever it is, will command the attention of the United States Congress, a majority of Supreme Court justices, just about the entire Cabinet, and the television viewing audience during prime time is an important moment.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this year\xe2\x80\x99s speech, like every State of Union that takes place in an election year, will be taking place in a political environment.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately this is an opportunity for the American people to hear from their President about the condition of the country and what that President\xe2\x80\x99s vision is for the future of the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is -- even in the midst of the swirl of television ads and YouTube videos, tweets, and everything else -- that having a moment where everybody is focused on one speech I think is probably a pretty good thing both for the country but also for the political debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But fewer people are focused on it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got more channels now.\xc2\xa0 It used to be when you and I were growing up, there were three channels and you pretty much had to watch the State of Union address.\xc2\xa0 Now you can watch \xe2\x80\x9cDesperate Housewives\xe2\x80\x9d if you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re also speaking to a more polarized Congress, half of which is going to sit on their hands for a lot of what the President says and the other half is going to get up and applaud. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different environment than it used to be. \xc2\xa0And so I guess my question is geared to trying to get at, do you acknowledge that reality?\xc2\xa0 And how are you adjusting the communications strategy for this speech to acknowledge that new communication reality of YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat that you just alluded to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would say there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that this exercise has changed, but I don\'t think that makes it any less important.\xc2\xa0 In some ways, I guess the case I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make is that it might be even more important than in an era where there was just less political communication because the technology at the time in the form of printing presses couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accommodate a whole lot of more political debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut obviously the situation is different now.\xc2\xa0 And I actually think that that makes this one moment where the country sort of acknowledges that the President gets an hour to assess the condition of the country and to offer up a prescription for confronting the challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities is as important as ever.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'re surely going to use these new avenues for communicating that message to the American people.\xc2\xa0 There will be more Snapchats.\xc2\xa0 There will be more YouTube videos.\xc2\xa0 Even Amazon is going to be running the State of Union address as a video-on-demand piece.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re looking for new ways that we can capitalize on these tools to broadcast the State of Union even more broadly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, in an era where the political debate is chock-full of arguments, having a moment where everybody focuses on what the President has to say is I think an important part of keeping the country together, and continuing and advancing a political debate that is up to the challenge of responding to the will of the people.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you a State of Union question, but first I want to follow up on your answer to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about Senator Sanders.\xc2\xa0 You were describing the White House\xe2\x80\x99s pride in being transparent about visitors.\xc2\xa0 So either the President met with Senator Sanders in the last week or he met with him last\xc2\xa0 year -- because the President has been away and Senator Sanders has been busy campaigning.\xc2\xa0 So can I ask you again, when did that meeting take place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t take place in the last week.\xc2\xa0 It was at some point last year, but I don\'t know when.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was it a one-on-one meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned to Jim, they\xe2\x80\x99ve both had a one-on-one meeting and met in settings that included more than just the two of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was it the meeting that the President desired to have with the Democratic candidate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who invited him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now I guess my State of Union question -- the State of Union -- in your answer to the question that Margaret asked you about the speech, you know that there are many Americans from both parties who are concerned about Washington being broken and the dysfunction, so what extent does the President want to use this speech as a chance to talk about his use of executive power to try leap over the body that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alexis, I recognize that that\xe2\x80\x99s how our critics often characterize executive actions.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is we have been clear at every stage that the President taking an executive action does not in any way absolve Congress of their responsibility to take action.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t take action to keep guns out of the wrong hands as a way to go around Congress.\xc2\xa0 He did that because he wanted to use every element of his authority to try to keep our communities and our kids safe -- or at least make them safer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we are just as convinced as we were the day before the President announced these actions that Congress needs to pass legislation -- common-sense steps that would, for example, close the gun show loophole, or close the no-fly, no-buy loophole that currently allows somebody who is on the no-fly list to buy a gun. We certainly believe that there is legislation that could be passed to ensure that gun manufacturers are actually held accountable both for their business practices and for their products.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions are not at all a substitute for congressional action.\xc2\xa0 The same is true when it comes to minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 The same is true when it comes to immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI recognize that there are some members of Congress who are hoping that this gets them off the hook, that they can somehow use the President\xe2\x80\x99s action as an excuse not to act.\xc2\xa0 But they\'re learning the wrong lesson if that\'s the case they want to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Is Mr. Buffett going to be in Omaha with the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what Mr. Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know what his schedule is.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know, obviously, when we get to Omaha.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to talk about State of Union.\xc2\xa0 And over the weekend, the White House put out a release that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be using this Genius app to annotate the speech.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be where maybe more detailed descriptions of policy proposals are going to be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a variety of places that you can go.\xc2\xa0 You can surely check the White House website for more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of Union speech after he gives it.\xc2\xa0 But there are a variety of ways in which we are hoping to help people understand exactly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas include.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you\'ve touched on another of them.\xc2\xa0 This is a platform online, Genius, that allows people to essentially annotate documents to provide more information.\xc2\xa0 Actually, I learned about this a little over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Apparently, this is a tool that actually was used to annotate rap lyrics, but has been appropriated for a variety of different topics.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, it\xe2\x80\x99s been appropriated to help people better understand what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the State of Union.\xc2\xa0 So, just another example of the kind of interesting tools that we\'re hoping to use to give people a sense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about the State of Union.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Tune in tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t2:09 P.M.
