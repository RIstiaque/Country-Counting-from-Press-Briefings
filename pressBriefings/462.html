Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, I know this is confusing.\xc2\xa0 I am not an Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s fan, but I am wearing this because last night the 12-U Bethesda-Chevy Chase Select baseball team completed an undefeated season by winning the championship.\xc2\xa0 And I want to congratulate my son\xe2\x80\x99s team and all the players and the coach, Arnie Brooks, who is a great, great guy.\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s to the BCC A\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is the only announcement I have at the top, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go right to your questions -- except to say that the President, as you know, does have an event at 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep the briefing, unless everybody decides they want to run over and cover that.\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted to note that that is currently on schedule.\xc2\xa0 And if anybody needs to go over, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep going.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify something on behalf of my colleagues -- this is not your swan song today, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- probably not.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 It depends on how it goes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can I decide that at the end?\xc2\xa0 I might have one more in me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President just today, with Prime Minister Abbott, said that the U.S. is prepared to take military action when our national security is threatened.\xc2\xa0 Does the Islamic State of Iraq represent a threat to U.S. national security?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said, Jim, we are very concerned about the ISIL and the extremist threat in northwestern Iraq and the bordering region with Syria.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that Iraq is a strong and important partner to us.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have the collaborative relationship with Iraq that we have.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have provided substantial assistance to Iraq, including military assistance.\xc2\xa0 And we have increased that assistance over the past year as the challenges posed by the unrest, the civil war in Syria have spilled over, and now in the last several days caused great concern with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President made clear was that we have been providing a significant amount of assistance to Iraq, including military hardware.\xc2\xa0 I believe Josh detailed some of that the other day.\xc2\xa0 And we are actively considering requests from the Iraqi government and looking very closely at other efforts we can undertake to assist Iraq in this very serious situation.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as the President also made clear, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future has to be decided by a unified effort among the different groups and political parties in Iraq coming together in moderation to fight the extremist threat posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve had discussions with Prime Minister Maliki and others about, other Iraqi leaders about, and that continues to be the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the considerations, have you specifically ruled out the use of any U.S. ground forces?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are not contemplating ground troops.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear about that.\xc2\xa0 The President was answering a question specifically about air strikes.\xc2\xa0 And he made clear that we are considering our options as part of the overall effort to support Iraq as part of the overall assistance that we provide and can provide Iraq in this fight.\xc2\xa0 But we are not contemplating ground troops.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So air strikes specifically are part of the consideration?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- when he said that he\xe2\x80\x99s not ruling anything out, he was responding to the question about request for air strikes or would he consider air strikes.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he meant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concerns that this is maybe a little bit too late?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that we have been ramping up our assistance to Iraq, including substantial amounts of military materiel and hardware for some time now.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen in the past several days is a significant and concerning escalation in the violence and in movements by ISIL forces, jihadists into the country and the occupation of some towns and cities in the country.</p>\n<p>So we have a near-term situation that we need to move very quickly on, and we are assessing what we can provide additionally, what we can do additionally to assist Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We also have the longer-term, ongoing challenge in our partnership with Iraq, in helping them to take steps to further unify the country and also to assist them through the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, for example, to be better prepared to handle this kind of threat now and in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And were you surprised at this sudden showing of strength by the insurgency?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I know that we have been monitoring this for some time and have been very concerned about and have discussed our concern about the problems caused by the unrest in Syria and the war in Syria, and the porousness of the border with Iraq -- the challenges that creates for Iraq and has created for Iraq, and the need for Iraq to have its capacities increased and for Iraq itself to apply those capacities in a way that meets the challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is why we have taken the steps we have in the past, including delivery of 300 Hellfire missiles, millions of rounds of small-arms fire, thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, helicopter-fired rockets, machine guns, grenades, flares, sniper rifles, M16s and M4 rifles to the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>We also delivered additional Bell IA-407 helicopters late last year, and 10 ScanEagle surveillance platforms are on schedule for delivery this summer.\xc2\xa0 I think you also have been told that we recently notified Congress of an additional sale of $1 billion in arms, including up to 200 Humvees.\xc2\xa0 And that sale is now in a 30-day review period.</p>\n<p>Under the strategic framework agreement, we have also expanded our training programs both inside Iraq and in Jordan, where a second round of CT training will occur this summer.\xc2\xa0 So this is part of an ongoing effort to help the Iraqi security forces deal with this threat.\xc2\xa0 As the President noted, there is also the need for a unified political approach to be taken by the Iraqi government in response to this common threat that the extremists pose, extremists who -- an extremist group and the members of an extremist group who do not have Iraqi national interests at heart, but who are bent on death and destruction in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the threat they pose is to every individual within Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And, therefore, we will continue our discussions, including in the ongoing consultations that the Vice President has with Iraqi leaders, to urge more unity among the political parties and communities in Iraq as they deal with this challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, let me just quickly ask about immigration.\xc2\xa0 The President last night said immigration reform is not dead, despite the Cantor defeat.\xc2\xa0 Does this mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out the possibility of taking some sort of administrative action on deportation before the August recess?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was referring to the effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the broad coalition and consensus that existed prior to this week\xe2\x80\x99s primary in the 7th District of Virginia is as strong as it was -- is as strong today as it was then.\xc2\xa0 And the House ought to follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and pass a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform measure that would provide extraordinary benefits to our economy, to our security and to our businesses, and would deal with this challenge in a comprehensive way.\xc2\xa0 And that imperative hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed at all.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk over the last two days about the surprise of seeing how fast things have been moving in Iraq. But given what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on in Syria for such a long time, was it exactly this scenario something that this administration foresaw for some time?\xc2\xa0 And if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, then should it have been?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think I just said, we have been very aware and have discussed here and in other venues the challenge posed by the war in Syria and the extremist activity there and the ISIL as it formed and moved across the border into Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that has always been a great concern.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have stepped up the assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been providing to the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the surprise is what?\xc2\xa0 How quickly --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think the President accurately said just moments ago in the Oval Office, we cannot be everywhere at all times.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq or elsewhere, we need to partner with other countries and their militaries and security forces to assist them in combatting these kinds of extremist challenges.\xc2\xa0 And that is what the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund is about that the President discussed in West Point, and that is very much the manner in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve approached our close relationship with the Iraqi government and the support that we give Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, a nation -- a sovereign nation like Iraq has to have the capacity to deal with these kinds of challenges.\xc2\xa0 We can assist -- and we are -- and we will look at all options in this current near-term situation.\xc2\xa0 But the medium- and long-term solution to a challenge like this has to be one that is led by Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this make for a great argument for having -- for the U.S. should have acted sooner in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can remember answering questions probably before you got here, Michelle, about our concern -- or should we be concerned when it came to supplying lethal assistance to the opposition in Syria, about where that assistance and in whose hands that assistance would ultimately end up, and whether or not we could trust that that assistance would not find its way to extremists who actually had designs against U.S. national security interests or Americans themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is why we took the approach that we took, and it is also why we have established now, for quite some time, a manner by which we can provide and have provided substantial assistance to the moderate opposition, including to the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s armed elements.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we took precisely because we did not want and many others did not want for assistance from the United States to end up in the hands of extremists.</p>\n<p>Let me move up and back.\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The first is, when the President determined about a year ago that he wanted to launch air strikes against -- targeted air strikes against Syria, he decided that it was important to ask Congress for authorization for that.\xc2\xa0 If he makes the same determination here, do you guys feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to get any sort of authorization from Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are obvious legal authorities that exist regarding the use of military force in conflicts not in Syria but elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 We can get more for you on that.</p>\n<p>What the President said today is he is considering all options in response to the question about potential direct action by the United States military.\xc2\xa0 But we would have to get back to you on how that would proceed if that decision were made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, does this change at all your calculus for withdrawal from Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- certainly Republicans on the Hill have suggested that a big reason that the sort of rebel insurgency in Iraq was able to take hold was that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a continuing U.S. presence there.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that changes anything about sort of plans for Afghanistan going forward.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It does not change the approach that the President announced recently that we are taking in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We are ending that combat mission this year.\xc2\xa0 And we, pending the signing of a bilateral security agreement, will keep a smaller number of troops in Afghanistan focused exclusively on the missions that the President discussed.</p>\n<p>And I think that the broader question has to be when we talk about this is, should American men and women in uniform be fighting in Iraq today, and is that the right approach for our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 Should American forces be occupying countries for decades, or should we take the approach that the President took when he ended the war in Iraq and established a relationship with the sovereign government of Iraq through which we can provide the kind of assistance we provide.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the approach that he believes is the right approach to take, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly consistent with the strategy he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Following up on that question, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop the same thing from happening in Afghanistan that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything that gives you an assurance that we won\xe2\x80\x99t see the same thing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We need to have, as the President laid out in his speech at West Point, a strategy that is focused on partnering with the security forces of other countries that helps them develop the capacities necessary to deal with these kinds of threats, because we cannot have U.S. forces around the world in armed conflicts without end.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply not a wise approach to our national security interests.</p>\n<p>We retain, as the President made clear today, the right to use force -- military force -- unilaterally if necessary when our national security interests demand it.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\'t mean that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the medium- and long-term approach that we have to the challenge posed by terrorist groups like ISIL, that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t partner with other nations\xe2\x80\x99 security forces in an effort through the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, for example, that allows for those forces to work more effectively against the threat that these jihadists pose.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this not undercut, though, since you bring up West Point, the President\xe2\x80\x99s argument for a lighter footprint?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we can\'t have forces there indefinitely, but given the fact that it continues to devolve?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, but is the -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re asking that about Iraq, is the suggestion that we should send or we should still have tens of thousands of troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And if that is the proposition, then we can discuss that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly not the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we can do is consider requests from our partners in the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 We can provide the substantial assistance we already provide and have provided to the Iraqi government, including to Iraq security forces.\xc2\xa0 That\'s military materiel, it\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence assistance and the like.\xc2\xa0 And we can contemplate other requests and take action as needed and necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if the question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking is should we have 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000 troops in Iraq, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, not necessarily that troop level.\xc2\xa0 To another point, though, Senator Tim Kaine has said that the President should present a clear plan to Congress soon.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any immediate plans to consult with members of Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are in active consultation with members of Congress on the situation in Iraq, and we will continue to do that as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, Jay, how would you characterize what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq right now?\xc2\xa0 Would you characterize it as a civil war?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is an Islamic jihadist group composed substantially of non-Iraqis, as I understand it, but certainly mixed nationalities threatening the sovereign state of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the Iraqi security forces need to confront that threat, and we are working very closely with the government in Baghdad and with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to evaluate the kinds of assistance we can provide in addition to the assistance we\xe2\x80\x99ve already provided and the assistance that\'s on its way to help them meet that challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, would you characterize it as a civil war?\xc2\xa0 Or you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to go that far?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the way it characterized it reflects what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay Carney, (inaudible) from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for taking my question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, here today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been quite critical of the President in the past, some would say offensive at times about him.\xc2\xa0 Has all been forgiven?\xc2\xa0 And given that past relationship, how would you now describe it, especially since they disagree so much on climate change?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President said reflected the very close nature of the relationship between the United States and Australia, the alliance between our nations, the friendship between our nations.\xc2\xa0 And the tone of the meeting, the bilateral meeting reflected that warmth and high level of collaboration and cooperation.\xc2\xa0 The leaders discussed a number of issues, as you know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Climate change?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and climate change was one of them, of course.\xc2\xa0 And they talked about the importance of confronting climate change.\xc2\xa0 President Obama emphasized the need for ambitious domestic climate policies as the basis of a strong international response.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States will continue working with Australia to advance climate change, clean energy and energy efficiency solutions, including in the context of the G20.\xc2\xa0 So this was certainly a topic of discussion among many, as you would expect in a bilateral meeting between leaders of such close allies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he asked him to put it on the G20 agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific agenda for the G20 to lay out for you, but certainly within the context of the G20, this would be something that the President believes would be important to discuss.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask, do you have a readout at all about the TPP or the trade negotiations in this meeting with the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more detail than the President provided in his statement at the bottom of the bilat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe, based on briefings, that Baghdad is in jeopardy of being overrun?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President knows that the situation in Iraq is serious and that there needs to be action taken quickly in order to confront the challenge posed by the ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize the situation on the ground militarily.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Defense Department for that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware here at the White House -- and the President is very aware -- of that situation, and that is why he has made clear that we are assessing what efforts we can take, building on the efforts we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken, to assist the Iraqi government as it deals with this challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports Iranian al Quds forces assisted in this repelling or dealing with some of the ISIL forces.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any confirmation of that, and would it consider that a welcome development?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have seen reports, but we cannot confirm them, Major.\xc2\xa0 And while we appreciate the seriousness of the security situation in Iraq and the brutal actions of ISIL there, we urge the government of Iraq to take prudent decisions on how it will address this crisis in the spirit of national unity -- which goes back to the point I was making earlier that the only way for this to be effectively dealt with in Iraq in the medium and long term is for there to be political unity in Iraq, in combating a common enemy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is no side in Iraq that ISIL is fighting for.\xc2\xa0 This is a jihadist, extremist group that is bent on death and destruction within Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely necessary for the various factions within Iraqi politics and ethnic and religious groups to come together united by the threat posed to the Iraqi sovereign state here to rebuff the challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you also have a message for the Iranian government to stay out, even if invited?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that this is an issue for the sovereign government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And our view is they ought to make prudent decisions about how they deal with the threat in the interest of national unity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used earlier in your very first formulation, you talked about a unified effort that builds on moderation.\xc2\xa0 Can you in any way credibly apply either of those words -- unified or moderate -- to al-Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s governing of Iraq?\xc2\xa0 And how much blame does this administration put on his decision-making process in alienating Sunnis and others within the country?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can certainly say that we agree that all Iraqi leaders, including Prime Minister Maliki, need to address -- need to do more, rather, to address unresolved issues within Iraq to better meet the needs of the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 However, the threat to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s stability right now is ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And ISIL, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, has an ideology that has little to do with Iraqi domestic politics.\xc2\xa0 Rather, its aim is to take territory and terrorize the Iraqi people, regardless of sect or ethnic or religious affiliation.\xc2\xa0 Its ideology would be the same no matter who was in power in Baghdad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that said, we will continue to work with Iraqi leaders from across the political spectrum to encourage the kind of collaborative approach and governance that would best address these unresolved issues.\xc2\xa0 And we urge Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to secure support from all Iraqi communities by presenting a common political vision with tangible programs aimed at bringing the country together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This has been an ongoing challenge in Iraq as it tries to build a future as a sovereign state.\xc2\xa0 And in order to do that, Iraqi leaders need to have a unified vision about Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future that is not sliced into separate visions according to political affiliation or religious affiliation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have been grappling with for a number of years now.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an urgent challenge now, and I think the immediacy of the threat posed by this extremist group highlights the need for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and other political actors to set aside some of their differences to join together to meet the common threat posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, the Vice President, one of his advisors, Tony Blinken, have all in the past couple of years described Iraq as a success story.\xc2\xa0 When did it go bad?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is, Wendell, we have described what was the case, and that is that Iraq has over the years taken steps to resolve its internal political differences through peaceful means as opposed to through violence.\xc2\xa0 But this is an ongoing challenge within Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>ISIL is not a domestic political entity.\xc2\xa0 It is a force that is trying to claim territory and wreak havoc in Iraq, and it is a force that has no Iraqi citizens\xe2\x80\x99 interests at heart.\xc2\xa0 And that is why, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned before, the threat posed by ISIL is cause for increased unity among Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political factions, and a more cohesive approach to be taken by the central government in Baghdad when it comes to combatting this serious threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senators Graham and McCain both held I-told-you-so news conferences today, both saying that the price we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now, the risk of losing what Americans lost their lives for, was caused by not keeping U.S. troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Why are they wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, there is no question that Senator McCain and President Obama have differed on the Iraq war since Senator McCain was for it and Barack Obama was against it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that going back to 2008, when Senator McCain allowed that his vision might include tens of thousands of U.S. forces in Iraq in perpetuity, that that was in stark contrast as a vision to the one held by then-Senator Obama, which was that we should responsibly end what was already a very long war in Iraq.</p>\n<p>President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s view is that Iraq needs to, with the partnership of the United States, be able to handle its own security.\xc2\xa0 And I would note from some of the statements you said today that within a couple of sentences of each other, Senator McCain said that this is because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep troops in Iraq, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not calling for troops in Iraq, which -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a logics expert, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a little inconsistency in those statements, it would seem.</p>\n<p>The fact is, we can\xe2\x80\x99t, as the President said today, be everywhere at all times to meet the challenge posed by extremist groups like ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But we can partner with Iraq, as the President noted today, through the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and through our direct bilateral relationship and the assistance that we provide to Iraqi security forces as well as to the Iraqi people, work together to help Iraq beat back a challenge like this.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future has to be resolved by the Iraqi people and by the leadership of Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one final question.\xc2\xa0 You rattled off a list of the equipment we provided in Iraq, some of which is now in the hands of the ISIL folks.\xc2\xa0 And you were reluctant to be more aggressive in Syria, and it would appear that the problems have come over the border into Iraq.\xc2\xa0 How much of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Iraq now is a result of not taking a more aggressive response to the civil war in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I answered earlier, the approach we took was to carefully evaluate to whom we would be providing assistance in Syria in the opposition precisely so that that assistance did not end up in the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have for some time now provided substantial assistance to the opposition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But I think our past history shows, and understanding of the situation in both Syria and in portions of Iraq bears out, that we need to be very smart about how we -- and to whom we provide lethal assistance and military hardware of any kind.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the approach that we take.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach in terms of U.S. national security interests.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just a short while ago, Speaker of the House John Boehner described the deteriorating situation in Iraq, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the President doing?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s taking a nap.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to get your response to the Speaker of the House.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My response is the answers to questions a little more substantive that I\xe2\x80\x99ve given already about the situation in Iraq and the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.</p>\n<p>We provide substantial assistance to Iraqi security forces. I would note that in that same briefing, as I understand it, the highest elected leader of the Republican Party did not have any suggestions for an approach to Iraq that I could tell or any policy prescriptions that he would offer beyond the statement that you just repeated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on this question of troops, going back to the end of the war, the administration with Vice President Biden taking a lead role tried but failed to get a status of forces agreement with Iraq that would allow some U.S. troops to remain for training and counterterrorist operations.\xc2\xa0 Because of that failure, obviously all the troops had to come out immediately.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe -- does the White House believe the situation in Iraq would have been any different if you had not failed to get the status of forces agreement and there had been some residual U.S. force left in Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The agreement to which you refer was one that would have to have been reached between two sovereign nations.\xc2\xa0 And an agreement to allow for, under conditions that we would find acceptable, a remaining force from the American military was not reached through negotiations between the United States and Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The point I would make is that a relatively small number of troops designed specifically for the kind of narrow mission that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about with a post-2014 force in Afghanistan would not supplant the need, either in Afghanistan or Iraq, for national security forces to take the lead effectively in combating any extremist threat from the outside as you have with ISIL, or inside.\xc2\xa0 And again, if the argument is that we should have -- as some suggested going back to 2008 -- tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq in perpetuity --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very specific question about your attempt.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I answered that, which is that a small force focused on CT training -- CT and troop training and assistance is not the same as what was called for by others when it came to a substantial, essentially occupation force in Iraq in perpetuity, which obviously President Obama -- Senator Obama and candidate for Senate Obama never supported.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be very clear, so you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it would have made no difference -- that the situation in Iraq would not be different?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to hypothesize about what might have been in a different circumstance.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody can answer that question.</p>\n<p>What I can tell you is that a sovereign state of Iraq has security forces that need to be up to the task of dealing with these kinds of challenges.\xc2\xa0 Now, they will have the assistance that comes with partnership with the United States, as well as with other nations that have the interests of Iraq and its sovereignty at heart and provide substantial assistance to Iraq, as the United States does.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future needs to be decided and defended by Iraqis.</p>\n<p>Now, we are providing substantial assistance and we are considering in this current near-term challenge what other efforts we can undertake to help the Iraqis in this current situation.\xc2\xa0 But the long term here, and this was true two years ago, and it will be true two years from now, has to be one that sees an Iraqi future that is defended by a unified political leadership in Iraq and by Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and senior officials in this White House have repeatedly over the years, and as recently as Tuesday, described as the President\xe2\x80\x99s top foreign policy accomplishments ending the war in Iraq and decimating and destroying core al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Given what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now, can you still claim those as two of your signature achievements?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that the President pledged to end the war in Iraq, and he did.\xc2\xa0 And that was --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no war in Iraq right now?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 U.S. combat mission in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 U.S. combat.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What is also the case, and what the President made clear as we wound down the war in Iraq is that we need to be a good partner to the government in Iraq and provide the assistance that we can at their request to help them meet their security challenges.\xc2\xa0 And we have done that.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future has to be decided through reconciliation of the political factions within Iraq and a unified approach to dealing with the challenge posed by a group like the ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And decimating and destroying core al Qaeda when an al Qaeda-linked group is now in charge, in control of major cities in the heart of Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in your question, you have made the appropriate distinction, which is core Iraq [al Qaeda], based in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has unquestionably been severely compromised and decimated.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody would disagree with that.</p>\n<p>What we have been saying for a long time now is that when it comes to threats to the United States and our national security interests directly, the threat posed by affiliated groups has grown in Yemen for example and elsewhere as the core leadership and core al Qaeda in the Af-Pak region has been diminished and decimated.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve openly discussed that.\xc2\xa0 The President, John Brennan when he was here and also obviously over at the CIA has talked about it.\xc2\xa0 And that is a challenge that we are very upfront about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I don\'t think you can argue that when it comes to al Qaeda in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region that the strategy of going after core al Qaeda leadership has not been effectively prosecuted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it equally dangerous or arguably more dangerous to have an al Qaeda-linked group in control of major Iraqi cities than have them in the mountains of Pakistan?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would have to remind you that the most severe military attack on the United States in our lifetimes occurred -- was organized and ordered out of Afghanistan and Pakistan by core al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern here at the White House about a disruption of oil supplies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have obviously -- I don\'t have any specific information about that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that when it comes to the oil fields in -- let me make sure I get this right.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s in Baiji a refinery -- that we understand that that oil refinery remains in the control of the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But I have not -- I don\'t have any other additional information about that issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about reports, Jay, of evacuations of Americans just north of Baghdad?\xc2\xa0 The AP just -- a story that three planeloads of Americans are either going to be or have been evacuated as a precaution to get them out of the way of this moving insurgency.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d ask the State Department about that.</p>\n<p>Yes, Carrie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President not considering ground troops at this point, given that -- following on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s point -- that the administration had contemplated having troops there?\xc2\xa0 If you could just explain why that\xe2\x80\x99s not on the table.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that we should take.\xc2\xa0 In this case, we would agree with Senator McCain, who made that point I think today or at least that that was his view.\xc2\xa0 What the President was referring to was the question about contemplating air strikes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying, ultimately, the challenge posed by a group like ISIL has to be met by the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 Now, they can be assisted considerably -- as they have been and are being -- by the United States and other partners.\xc2\xa0 And we will review requests for further assistance and other kinds of assistance very closely, and obviously in this current situation very quickly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But ultimately, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future will be decided by the ability of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to come together in a spirit of unity to deal with all of the challenges that a nation like Iraq faces in building its future, and specifically in repelling the kind of assault that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now from an extremist group like ISIL, which is not focused on changing Iraqi domestic politics.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s focused on seizing territory and focused on death and destruction within Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s regardless of political affiliation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report that Bowe Bergdahl is coming back to the United States overnight.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, some people have pointed out that with ISIL advancing on Baghdad we may not have a common interest with Iran, but we may have sort of an overlapping interest in that they\xe2\x80\x99re worried obviously about the Shiites in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Major asked about the Quds force.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering more broadly whether you believe there is some degree of overlap in the interest that Iran and the U.S. have in this particular case.\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, what constructive role could Iran play in diffusing this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I think the question has to be not just the immediate crisis, but how Iraq can move forward.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports about this -- and we can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm them -- but we would certainly call on the government of Iraq to approach such considerations prudently and in the interest of national unity.\xc2\xa0 And Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future, as the President was saying, has to be one decided by all elements of Iraqi society.\xc2\xa0 And what you obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see happen is a situation where unity is even more severely tested than it has been in the past.\xc2\xa0 And that would I think suggest that the Iraqi government would need to approach that kind of question very carefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond staying out, is there something else Iran can do that would be constructive?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that this is specific to Iran, but everybody in the region and in the world we believe should have an interest in not seeing groups like ISIL flourish. And that\xe2\x80\x99s separate from religious affiliation.\xc2\xa0 It has to do with the sovereignty of a nation like Iraq, and the appalling actions taken by groups like ISIL that show no mercy when it comes to civilians and what their overall ambition is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask just one small internal question?\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden obviously had this as his portfolio for the first term in a fairly formal way, and that changed a bit in the second term.\xc2\xa0 With this now metastasizing like this, is he deeply engaged?\xc2\xa0 Is there some thought to having him pick this up again?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden has continued to be one of the principal interlocutors of the administration with Iraqi leaders.\xc2\xa0 He has a long history in Iraq with all of the political groups there and with the leaders there.\xc2\xa0 And that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 And certainly in recent months, the Vice President has been actively engaged in discussions with the Iraqi leadership.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as the President is assessing this indirect help in Iraq, what are the guarantees that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be some boots going back over there to help out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not contemplating boots on the ground, April.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at options that we can take, including in the assistance that we provide, military assistance and other assistance that we can provide to the Iraqi security forces, to the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating requests of other actions that we might take.\xc2\xa0 The President was referring, in answer to the question in the Oval Office earlier today, to specifically the question about whether he would consider direct action, U.S. airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not considering boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as things happen -- and they\xe2\x80\x99re not expected and anticipated, and may escalate -- what are the guarantees that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just not considering that, April.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Andrei, and then Zeke.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it may not be your last briefing, but it may be my last opportunity to ask a question of you.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank you for trying to be fair to me and to others from the podium.\xc2\xa0 It is appreciated.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, today is Russia\xe2\x80\x99s National Day, the equivalent of the 4th of July.\xc2\xa0 So looking back at the new Russia, can you fairly say that the United States has done all you can to be true partners with the new Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By \xe2\x80\x9cnew Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d you mean post-Soviet Russia?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Post-Soviet Russia.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the approach that President Obama has taken, as you know, has been one that has been driven by a clear focus on our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And where our interests and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interests overlap, we have been able to cooperate.\xc2\xa0 And we have also been very clear about our disagreements with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Those disagreements have intensified, as you know, most especially over Russia\xe2\x80\x99s extremely unhelpful approach to the situation in Ukraine and its illegal claims of annexation of a portion of the sovereign territory of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>But we, again, will continue to approach the relationship with Russia in a very deliberate manner.\xc2\xa0 We call on Russia to use its influence to prevail upon separatists in Ukraine to lay down their arms, to vacate buildings they\xe2\x80\x99ve occupied, and to abide by the approach announced by the new President of Ukraine when it comes to reconciliation and moving forward in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>And we urge Russia to take that action to recognize the new President, and to cease its assistance to the separatists in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make our views on that issue and other areas where we disagree very clear, both publicly and in our conversations -- frequent conversations -- with our counterparts in the Russian government.</p>\n<p>We will also continue to work with Russia cooperatively where we can, and there are areas where we continue to work cooperatively with Russia because it is in our national security interest and in our national interest to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may, one on Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you call on the government in Kyiv to show at least some restraint in the military operations that they have against their own people, and the shelling and the bombing basically their own region, their own people?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, I think that we all need to be clear-eyed about who is responsible for the violence in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And I would urge you to, as well.\xc2\xa0 As you know probably, President Poroshenko presented in his inaugural address on June 7th a peace plan that included a ceasefire contingent on Russia taking immediate steps to deescalate the situation, including by recognizing President Poroshenko as the legitimate leader of Ukraine, ceasing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and stopping the provision of arms and materiel across the border.</p>\n<p>We are concerned by reports that these groups are now in possession of heavy weapons, including tanks, which would represent a significant escalation.</p>\n<p>When Vice President Biden spoke to President Poroshenko, the two leaders -- President Poroshenko, rather, confirmed that if the separatists disarm and vacate buildings they presently occupy, the Ukrainian government is prepared to grant amnesty within Ukraine or offer safe passage back to Russia to those Russian militants now operating in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden expressed his strong support for the trilateral discussions between Ukraine, Russia and OSCE Special Representative Heidi Tagliavini.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think the government in the Kyiv has demonstrated an absolute commitment to deescalating the conflict, to reconciliation within Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It would be a very good thing, indeed, if Russia would follow suit.</p>\n<p>Sorry, Zeke.\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier to Justin that the President has legal authorities to take unilateral action.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if one of those legal authorities includes the 2002 Iraq Resolution, which is still on the books?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the President has the authority under that resolution to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Zeke, what I said, as I continued to answer that question, was that we will evaluate requests and consider different actions that we may take.\xc2\xa0 The President made that clear in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have a decision on that specific issue now.\xc2\xa0 When we do, we can certainly get back to you on that question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Senator Menendez just a couple of weeks ago introduced legislation to repeal that resolution from 12 years ago.\xc2\xa0 And it has five or six co-sponsors in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House would be supportive of, repealing that resolution from the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think broadly, separate from the current circumstances, we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on what he\xe2\x80\x99s said in the past.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:26 P.M.
