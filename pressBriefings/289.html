Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>**Please see below for an addendum to the transcript, marked with asterisks.</p>\n<p>1:22 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Let me do one quick thing at the top, Jim, and then we\'ll go to your questions.</p>\n<p>As you may have seen in the statement from the President, earlier today he had the great pleasure of nominating Gayle Smith to be the next Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\xc2\xa0 Those of us within and outside government who have had an opportunity to get to know Gayle recognize that her knowledge, experience and passion render her uniquely qualified for this important role.</p>\n<p>In her current position as Senior Director for Development and Democracy at the National Security Council, Gayle has been instrumental in guiding our international development policy, responding to a record number of humanitarian crises worldwide, and ensuring that development remains at the forefront of our national security agenda.</p>\n<p>If confirmed -- maybe I should say, when confirmed -- Gayle would bring this same drive and conviction to USAID, whose mission and unique capabilities are now more indispensable than ever.\xc2\xa0 As the President noted, we encourage the Senate to act swiftly on this important nomination.</p>\n<p>So, with that, Jim, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President is hosting the New Democrat Coalition from Congress today, a group that he particularly needs for support on trade.\xc2\xa0 And last time trade promotion authority or fast track passed in 2002, it only garnered about 25 Democratic votes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President thinks that he can reach that threshold this time, or improve on it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, the President is looking forward to the meeting that he\'ll have with members of the New Democrat Coalition here in the White House complex this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 The President intends to speak with them about a range of legislative priorities, but everyone in this room understands that building support for trade promotion authority is among the top priorities that the President has when it comes to his legislative agenda.</p>\n<p>At this point, I would not hazard a guess about the number of Democrats who will ultimately support this proposal.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear I think in a variety of settings how strong an argument he can make to Democrats about why the proposal that he is pleased to see moving currently through Congress is one that would allow him to reach an agreement that is clearly in the best interest of American businesses and American workers.</p>\n<p>Now, there is still important work that needs to get done.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President had the opportunity to discuss this with Prime Minister Abe here at the White House this week.\xc2\xa0 But there is still important work that needs to get done in pursuit of this effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the New Democrat Coalition has about 40 or so members, but only about a dozen of them signed on to a letter supporting the TPA agreement that Senator Wyden, Senator Hatch and Paul Ryan came up with.\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s some real problem of even getting moderates who typically support these kinds of things?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think one clear way for us to measure this is to take a look at the one committee in the United States Congress that\'s voted on this so far*, and in the Senate Finance Committee, we saw that more Democrats supported this legislation that opposed it.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a very early preliminary measure, but I think it\'s one indication that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to make a compelling case to Democrats and get some Democratic support for this proposal. *The House Ways and Means Committee also passed a trade promotion authority bill earlier this month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the historic, reflexive opposition that many Democrats have as soon as anyone utters the word \xe2\x80\x9ctrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The President is sympathetic to that.\xc2\xa0 The President had his concerns with previous trade agreements that had been signed into law because of the impact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had on some communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 That precisely why the President wants to pursue this kind of trade agreement that would build on the lessons that we\'ve learned from those previous trade agreements, modernize them, update them in a way that will actually include enforceable provisions that will protect American workers, that will protect the environment, and ultimately level the playing field in a way that will open up a variety of other markets throughout the Asia Pacific to American goods and services.\xc2\xa0 And by leveling that playing field, the President is confident that that will create a prime opportunity for American businesses to succeed in a way that\'s good for our economy and good for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, the White House today has agreed to several recommendations from the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The MCRMC, as we call it around here, Jim.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s enough with that.\xc2\xa0 But the White House rejected one that perhaps sort of resulted in the most savings, and that was a proposal to replace the military\xe2\x80\x99s TRICARE health care system.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you could explain that decision, since that would have been the biggest savings available.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, we\'re going to have more on this today as more of the details of this review comes forward.\xc2\xa0 But I can just say as a general matter that the administration has accepted 10 of the 15 recommendations that have been put forward by the MCRMC.\xc2\xa0 And the administration did acknowledge that some of the other ideas they put forward that we haven\'t at this point fully supported do merit additional study.\xc2\xa0 These are proposals that do address concerns I think that everybody acknowledges -- I guess they address challenges that everybody acknowledges that our armed forces are facing right now.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the growth in retirement benefits in a way that has significant budgetary impacts on the armed forces.</p>\n<p>So we\'re mindful of this challenge and are serious about considering thoughtful proposals to try to address them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if a decision, though, is based mostly on policy considerations and some of those apprehensions, or whether it was because you recognize that there was no support for it in Congress and it was not a worthwhile effort to pursue.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll have more on this today.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the dynamic that you have outlined is one I think that can be reconciled.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is a legitimate policy reason to build strong support in Congress for a proposal before putting it forward.\xc2\xa0 I think it depends on the specific policy matter that\xe2\x80\x99s at hand, but particularly when you\'re considering something as serious as this, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see some bipartisan support build in Congress as we try to advance a proposal.</p>\n<p>But, again, the proposals that we\'ve seen from the MCRMC are proposals that do confront legitimate challenges that we know are facing our armed forces and our men and women in uniform, and the administration is supportive of additional study to review the recommendations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made to evaluate how those recommendations would apply in terms of solving the problem and what broader impact they would have on the system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But stay tuned for a little bit more on this today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, can you comment on the defense authorization bill that came out of the House Armed Services Committee today?\xc2\xa0 It has a lot of restrictions on the movement of detainees at Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 It provides funding to Kurdish fighters in Iraq and provides for lethal assistance to Ukrainian forces, all policies that the White House opposes.\xc2\xa0 Is that veto bait?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of proposals in the NDAA that we are strongly concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And this was true of the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s mark that was put forward a couple of days ago.\xc2\xa0 I think our top concern, Jim, actually is focused on some of the budgetary impacts of this particular NDAA.\xc2\xa0 Specifically it envisions a funding gimmick -- \xe2\x80\x9cgimmick\xe2\x80\x9d is the word that\'s been used by members in both parties to describe this proposal -- that would essentially fund the day-to-day operations of the Department of Defense using an emergency fund.</p>\n<p>That\'s not a responsible budget practice and it certainly is not consistent with what the President believes in necessary to protect the country.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ve raised those concerns before, and certainly any proposal that only funds our national security agencies at the sequester level and seeks to circumvent the sequester through this accounting gimmick is not consistent with an approach that takes very seriously our national security priorities.</p>\n<p>And that\'s our principal concern.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve raised previous concerns about efforts of the Congress to prevent the administration from closing Guantanamo Bay -- the prison at Guantanamo Bay, for instance.\xc2\xa0 And so some of those policy riders continue to be concerns that we also have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President could avoid with a signing statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will -- I know that in signing previous NDAA bills, the President has included signing statements and has raised concerns with some of the proposals that were included in the bill.\xc2\xa0 But this is just the beginning of the process, and we\'re going to continue to make clear the concerns that we have on this.\xc2\xa0 And again, the kinds of concerns that you\'re hearing from me are representative concerns that are held across the administration, but are also concerns that have previously been articulated by Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, specifically as it relates to this funding gimmick.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how many Democrats are coming to the White House for the meeting today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a full tally.\xc2\xa0 But you certainly can deploy the ample resources that Reuters devotes to covering Capitol Hill to calling the members of the New Democrat Coalition and finding out who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking you.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me even a rough number?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that number.\xc2\xa0 Each of these members of Congress will set their own schedule.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think there are 40 or so members of the New Democrat Coalition so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty good head start.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The President met with Leader Pelosi yesterday. She has said that she hopes accommodations can be made to the trade agreements to get to yes.\xc2\xa0 Are you actively looking at accommodations like that?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a little bit more of a readout of how that meeting went yesterday?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed readout of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But the President is interested in having conversations with Democrats in Congress about why they can be supportive of the kind of trade agreement that he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to reach with 10 or 11 other Asia Pacific countries.\xc2\xa0 Again, the case that the President makes to them in private is very similar to the one that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from him directly in public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\'m asking whether or not the President is willing to make some accommodations that Leader Pelosi and other Democrats are asking in order to get their support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of any specific proposals that Leader Pelosi has put forward, but the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re actively engaged in having a conversation with them is to both make the case to them about why we believe they and other Democrats should be supportive of trade promotion authority, but also to hear from them their reaction to the proposal and, where possible, to incorporate their feedback.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate issue.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner has said he\xe2\x80\x99s open to letting the Ex-Im Bank expire.\xc2\xa0 How big of a concern is that, now, again, for the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That continues to be a concern.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked in previous settings -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring the statistics out with me -- in previous settings about the number of times that Democratic and Republican Presidents have signed into law legislation reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that even President Reagan spoke powerfully about the economic benefits of the Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0 Those are benefits that have benefitted our economy for more than a generation.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that those are benefits that we should continue to enjoy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to strongly push Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to work together to figure out how to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, any reaction to the Bernie Sanders announcement today that he\xe2\x80\x99s running for President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, no reaction to Bernie Sanders running for President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No specific reaction, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of Bernie Sanders?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a conversation with him about it.\xc2\xa0 They obviously served together in the United States Congress, and Senator Sanders is somebody that has a strong track record of fighting for progressive values and middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to make a case for his own presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has, in quite strong terms, made the case that this trade agreement is a much better trade agreement than, for instance, NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that the United States negotiated a bad agreement with NAFTA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about this publicly -- that there are some lesson that we can learn from NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 For example, NAFTA did not include enforceable labor protections.\xc2\xa0 It includes some labor protections, but they\xe2\x80\x99re included in essentially a side agreement that was not enforceable.\xc2\xa0 NAFTA did not include enforceable environmental protections. And again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a similar mechanism where they were included in the side letter that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enforceable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact is that both Canada and Mexico are among the countries that are negotiating this Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 So it does give us an opportunity to modernize and improve NAFTA based on the higher enforceable standards that would be put in place through TPP, if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then I want to ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Yet more relations about the Clinton Foundation, the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 network of charities, this latest involving their health initiative, Health Access Initiative.\xc2\xa0 Once again, we\xe2\x80\x99re learning that the Clinton Foundation did not disclose foreign donors as they had assured the President -- as Secretary Clinton had assured the President she would.\xc2\xa0 So I have to ask you again.\xc2\xa0 Is the President disappointed that Secretary Clinton apparently did not live up to the very promises of transparency that she promised the President she would?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, the President continues to be very proud of the exemplary service that Secretary Clinton performed at the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of her service.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m asking -- she said she was going to disclose foreign donors to her family\xe2\x80\x99s charities and she did not -- time and time again.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I see that there have been some statements from the Clinton Foundation about their intent to correct some previous errors that had been made in previous tax filings and things.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m, frankly, not aware of all the details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you just one.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- while she was Secretary of State, their contributions from governments, almost all of them foreign governments -- this is in the Boston Globe story today -- doubled from $26.7 million to $55.9 million.\xc2\xa0 While she was Secretary of State, foreign governments doubling the amount of money that was going to this Clinton charity and none of it disclosed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But also no evidence to indicate that those contributions had any impact on any policy decisions that she made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the law?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you have to prove bribery?\xc2\xa0 Is that the only thing that would be a problem is out-and-out bribery?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if the President came in --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The lack of evidence certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t prevented others -- her political opponents from making those kinds of accusations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that the bar the President set?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the point is that we have seen those accusations flying pretty fast and furious, and that\'s --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you about that accusation.\xc2\xa0 I asked about her promise to be transparent with the donors from foreign governments while she was Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 This was a promise she made to the President.\xc2\xa0 It was part of her confirmation process.\xc2\xa0 The senators that voted for her confirmation were reassured by this.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re looking back and see that that promise was not kept.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m asking, does the President have any concern about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, based only on what I read in the public reports, it\'s apparent to me that the Clinton Foundation is going back to remedy the mistakes that they have acknowledged that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the past when it comes to reporting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that enough for the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what steps the Clinton Foundation intends to take.\xc2\xa0 But based on what they have said publicly, it sounds like they are serious about correcting those mistakes.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 J.C.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This week -- in fact, today, we marked the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the U.S. war effort in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 What lessons from that experience might you think have guided President Obama as he ends the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not where I thought you were taking that question.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\'m pausing.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me tell you the first thing that popped into my head as you were talking about this, that, obviously one of the reasons the President is pursuing this Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is it is an opportunity for the United States to more deeply engage in the Asia Pacific region and the President sees a clear economic benefit for the American people in doing so; that there continues to be a risk that as the United States were to disengage from that region that we would see China move aggressively into what they consider to be their sphere of influence and essentially write rules of the road that would put American businesses and American workers at a significant disadvantage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Of course, the reason they would write the rules of the road that way is it would significantly advantage Chinese economic opportunities.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, not what the President wants to see.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the case that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make to Democrats, which is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the status quo, if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the significant number of countries and companies that try to capitalize on cheap labor to gain an unfair advantage over American businesses and American goods and services, that we need to change that.\xc2\xa0 And one important way we can change that is to go in and raise standards in an enforceable way both when it comes to worker protections and environmental protections.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s contemplated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>\n<p>And what\xe2\x80\x99s important about this is that when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Asia Pacific region, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about some of the most dynamic, populated markets anywhere in the world, which means that there\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about large markets where the United States can more effectively do business.\xc2\xa0 And that would be good for the American economy.</p>\n<p>And I guess as it relates to your question, I think it\'s a testament to how much progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in just the last four decades in terms of representing American interests and creating opportunities for the American people in a region of the world that not too long ago we were fighting a very bloody war.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And including the historical reference to Afghanistan and extricating U.S. forces from there as well, the lessons learned from Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 I\'m specifically thinking in terms of the vets, how much different vets are treated now than they were back 40 years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is no question in the mind of the President -- and I think this is a testament to the way the President conducts himself -- that we are deeply indebted and we deeply honor the service of American men and women who have served overseas in our armed forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, just yesterday the President traveled to Walter Reed to visit some of our men and women in uniform who were wounded overseas.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that is a testament to the service and sacrifice of American military personnel.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as the Commander-in-Chief, looks forward to the opportunity that he has every quarter to extend in person his gratitude to those Americans who have paid such a deep sacrifice for their country.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to trade.\xc2\xa0 Republicans on the Hill are suggesting that they\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to be able to carry the weight of getting the trade promotion authority bill through Congress and that the President has to step up and do more to persuade his own members.\xc2\xa0 Based on what you said about the historical, kind of reflexive resistance in the Democratic Party to these agreements and TPA in general, does he share that view that he is really going to need to change a lot of minds here?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s making progress in that?\xc2\xa0 And to go back to what Jeff asked you, are their specific adjustments he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make to the negotiations or the legislation itself to try to persuade more Democrats they need to vote yes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 First, let me point out the irony of Republicans campaigning very aggressively to win a majority in both Houses of Congress so that they could advance their policy agenda, and three months later, turn around to all of you in asking what the President is going to do to help them get their work done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but on a priority that they themselves have identified.\xc2\xa0 I would acknowledge that, yes, it is also part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, which is why he is going to do his part to make a very aggressive case to the American public and to Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill about why the agreement that he is trying to broker with these Asia Pacific countries is clearly in the best interest of the United States, our businesses, our workers, and our broader economy.</p>\n<p>And I do believe that the President -- and I think the President feels good about the case that he has to make, and I think that he feels good about the way that it has been received on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re under no illusions about changing every single mind on Capitol Hill in both parties, but we do believe that we have a strong case to make.\xc2\xa0 And the President has invested his own time to making that case in person, as evidenced by the fact that this will be among the things that he\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss with Democrats that he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I would just point back to there\xe2\x80\x99s only been one vote on TPA in the Congress so far*, and it took place in the Senate Finance Committee.\xc2\xa0 And even though there\xe2\x80\x99s a minority of Democrats that serve on that committee, more Democrats voted for it than against it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very early indication -- I\'m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s what the situation is going to look like on the floor, and in fact, I\'m pretty sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t, but I think it is an indication that Democrats who do spend a lot of time thinking about this issue and looking at it, that there are plenty of reasons for them to support the President\xe2\x80\x99s position. *The House Ways and Means Committee also passed a trade promotion authority bill earlier this month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there are a lot of political crosscurrents here -- there are Democrats who are already criticizing pro-trade Republicans in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania for their support or anticipated support for fast track trade authority.\xc2\xa0 Will the President tell them to stop making that argument?\xc2\xa0 And if not, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that going to undermine his push to get votes -- Republican votes to get this through?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the more effective way for the President to rebut that argument is not to tell them to stop doing something, but to actually make the affirmative case about why so clearly an agreement like the one the President is trying to broker is in the best interest of American middle-class families.</p>\n<p>And he will do that here in Washington D.C.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll do that in interviews with some of you.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll do that in the context of private meetings with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll go on the road and make that case to business leaders across the country\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 that this is an agreement that is clearly in the both short-term and long-term best interest of our economy and middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last couple of days we heard the President speak directly on racial tension in America.\xc2\xa0 And at times, it almost seemed like he was admonishing the press or the public for just reacting to unrest or spots of trouble.\xc2\xa0 But hasn\xe2\x80\x99t his reaction and his response to race mostly been reactionary as well?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the task force was in response to Ferguson.\xc2\xa0 Some of his most pointed statements on race have only been because things have happened.\xc2\xa0 So is this going to be a turning point for the President to speak more about race, or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been reactionary as well?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I think it\'s certainly appropriate for you to note that the President himself has chosen to publicly speak out when there have been flashpoints in these kinds of debates.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true, however, is that the President has been focused on these issues for quite some time, particularly in ways that may not necessarily get the active attention of even the press corps that follows him every day.</p>\n<p>So I have one good example of this.\xc2\xa0 May 17th, 2013 -- some of you may have been there to cover it -- the President traveled to -- you guessed it -- Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 And the President visited an organization called the Center for Urban Families where he had the opportunity to meet with fathers and families who are working hard to get job-training skills, who are working hard to make sure that their kids were going to a good school, and were looking for some support from the local economy and from other local elected officials as they try to do the right thing and do right by their families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President, over the course of that day that he spent in Baltimore, went to an elementary school where he learned about some early childhood education programs that were working to great effect in that city.\xc2\xa0 He spent time at Ellicott Dredges, a local business in Baltimore that does a lot of business at the port, and then he finished his visit that day by going to the Center for Urban Families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And my point here is to indicate that, yes, the President is very visible when we have these flashpoints, when the media is paying attention, for a good reason, to some of the very significant, entrenched challenges in communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true, and what is undeniable, is that the President is focused on these issues even when you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that as a criticism; I just say it as a fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s always this call whenever something does happen for him to go somewhere.\xc2\xa0 I mean, and it\xe2\x80\x99s getting to be kind of on repeat now and the response is, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s just going to cause a bigger scene.\xc2\xa0 But he talked about it yesterday in saying that he wants to go there when things calm down.\xc2\xa0 And does this mean that he -- when things happen, he actually wants to go and the scene that he would cause is preventing him from going?\xc2\xa0 Or does he feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s not productive?\xc2\xa0 Or what\xe2\x80\x99s his real take on this whole call for him to show up places when there\xe2\x80\x99s trouble?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The concern that he has right now is a very practical one.\xc2\xa0 It\'s simply that right now we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that significant law enforcement resources in Baltimore are being deployed to try to address some of the instability we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in that community over the last few days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wants to go?\xc2\xa0 Is that what he was saying?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that when the President travels to those kinds of -- when the President travels anywhere, significant law enforcement resources are dedicated to protecting him, directing traffic around his motorcade that can sometimes be pretty inconvenient.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s concern is about drawing resource away from the urgent priority that they have right now to allow him to travel somewhere.</p>\n<p>So I am confident, as the President expressed in his interview with Steve Harvey, that at some point he would like to have the opportunity to go back to Baltimore and to continue the discussion that he -- frankly, that he was having with people in Baltimore two years ago -- to talk about what additional things can be done to address so many of the entrenched problems in that community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this reporting that we saw yesterday in the Wall Street Journal about the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s facilitating a ransom payment.\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about specific instances, but I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to say something about this when you\xe2\x80\x99ve so many times spoken out again and again, strenuously, on ransom payments?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, let me just start by saying that there is a review, a hostage policy review that\xe2\x80\x99s underway right now.\xc2\xa0 And that review illustrates a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is it illustrates what a priority it is for this President to try to rescue Americans who are being held hostage around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It also illustrates that the kind of support that is provided to families who are in this unthinkably tragic situation is also a priority for him.\xc2\xa0 And we go to great lengths -- and when I say we, I mean our law enforcement experts, our intelligence officers, even the military go to great lengths to both support those families and to try to rescue their loved ones.</p>\n<p>Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, I\'m not going to be in a position to go into private conversations that take place between the FBI or other law enforcement agencies, or intel officials and the families.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to be in a position to talk in any detail about the tactics or tools that are employed by the FBI, or the intelligence community, or our counterterrorism professionals as they support these families.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true, what\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable, is that the families, again, that are in this terrible situation are relying heavily on these government experts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true -- and this is where you started with your question -- is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been definitive about our no ransom, no concessions policy, and it\'s one that is not subject to this ongoing hostage policy review.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because that policy is clearly in our national security interest, that we know that extremist organizations only use ransoms to fund their terror activities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to put this in very simple terms, non-specifically, isn\xe2\x80\x99t facilitating a ransom payment tantamount to okaying it?\xc2\xa0 And is this a practice that is not going to happen in the future?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about specific tools or tactics that are used by the FBI or our intelligence community --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a philosophical, general sense of looking at two things, isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping with a ransom payment tantamount to saying it\xe2\x80\x99s okay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, speaking generally, helping with a ransom payment, to use your word, is not tantamount to paying a ransom.\xc2\xa0 And what we are trying to do is to aggressively enforce this policy -- which we do -- while also supporting these families that are relying on the expert advice and support of the FBI, other law enforcement agencies, and other national security officials that are trying to secure the safe return of their loved one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we can\xe2\x80\x99t say that this won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again in the future?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not going to talk about any individual conversations that take place between the FBI and individual families.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to walk through -- and I think for obvious reasons, I\'m unwilling to talk about the tactics and tools that the FBI and our military and our intelligence professionals use to try to secure the safe return of their loved one.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Jordan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said yesterday that the United Nations Security Council will need to lift sanctions within a few days of a final agreement being reached.\xc2\xa0 I assume the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t view that as a realistic timeline.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that when the President has talked about these ongoing negotiations with Iran we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that any sanctions relief from U.S. sanctions would only be provided once Iran had taken verifiable steps to comply with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously the United Nations Security Council -- and it\'s the permanent members of the Security Council that are engaged in these negotiations with Iran -- will have to decide for themselves the appropriate pace of offering relief from sanctions that are imposed by the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 That said, the United States has been clear about how we think that should proceed.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a lot of agreement around the negotiating table about how that should work, but at the same time, it\'s also part of the ongoing negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of where the negotiations are, but we have been definitive about our view that Iran will benefit from some sanctions relief only when they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some verifiable steps to implement the agreement in a verifiable way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even if the U.S. waits and, I guess, reduces the sanctions gradually, if the U.N. sanctions are lifted, that would essentially provide Iran with a lot of sanctions relief given that sanctions from a lot of these nations would pretty much disappear automatically.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not going to prejudge sort of how that sanctions relief would be granted, what pace or at what stage that decision would be made.\xc2\xa0 This is a subject of ongoing negotiations and will ultimately have to be a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the members of the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the other thing that will also be included in these negotiations are snapback provisions that would allow certainly the United States but also the United Nations to snap the sanctions back into place on very short notice if it\'s detected that Iran is not complying with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re not complying with the agreement, based on the onerous set of inspections that the President will insist upon including in the final agreement, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot of insight into their nuclear program and we\xe2\x80\x99ll use that insight to both verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement, but also enforce the agreement if we suspect -- enforce the agreement by snapping back in place sanctions if we suspect that Iran is not living up to their commitments.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A question about the Highway Trust Fund, which expires at the end of May.\xc2\xa0 The current thinking on Capitol Hill is to have a patch through the end of the year while negotiations continue on tax reform and repatriation.\xc2\xa0 Is that an acceptable plan to the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to render final judgment on a proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s still being debated and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen on the House floor -- or on the floor of either House of Congress at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As a general matter, I can tell you that the administration believes that a longer-term solution is one that is far better for the economy -- this is an argument that you hear from Republicans that a longer-term commitment to funding something like the Highway Trust Fund would give our businesses the kind of certainty they need to make the kinds of investments that are critical to the dynamism of our economy.\xc2\xa0 And for a long time the President has talked about the need for Congress to put in place policies that will actually strengthen our economic recovery as opposed to undermine our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 And short-term proposals to avert disaster is not a responsible way to govern.</p>\n<p>Now, in many situations, those short-term proposals are better than the alternative.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate the situation as it moves forward, but it is our strong view -- a strongly held view -- that Congress, as they\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating something like funding the Highway Trust Fund, should consider a long-term solution and not just fall back on the kind of short-term solutions that has been characterized -- or that has characterized the strategy previously employed by the Republican Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi today said that the bill was supposed to improve NAFTA, and yet fellow Democrat Alan Grayson has said this would essentially be NAFTA 2.0.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just curious, can the White House guarantee that if TPP goes through, the American workers won\xe2\x80\x99t suffer the sort of losses of jobs that they suffered under NAFTA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, what the President can guarantee will be included in a TPP agreement, if one can be reached, are enforceable labor protections that were not included in NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 TPP would include enforceable environmental protections that were not included in NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 The President will insist that they include some human rights protections that have not previously been included in trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re modernizing the NAFTA agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, I can say that because both Canada and Mexico are part of the TPP negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So if we can reach an agreement, we will reach an agreement that would strengthen the kinds of protections that will make it clear that an agreement like this would be in the best interest of the American economy, of American businesses, and American workers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other Democrats are concerned about fast track.\xc2\xa0 Elizabeth Warren had a letter to the President with Sherrod Brown saying that fast track as currently written would preclude Congress from amending or filibustering any trade agreement submitted to this Congress or any future Congress, potentially through 2021.\xc2\xa0 Is she wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the entirety of the letter.\xc2\xa0 What is envisioned in the trade promotion authority legislation is essentially the most progressive trade promotion authority bill that\xe2\x80\x99s ever been passed.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, it includes ensuring that we will have enforceable labor provisions -- or enforceable labor protections, enforceable environmental protections, human rights provisions.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of things that are consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that a properly crafted trade agreement is one that is clearly in the best interest of American workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because we already have -- the American public already has trade deals with some of the countries that are included in the TPP, if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out and you\xe2\x80\x99re unable to secure the votes to get this worked out, is that a huge loss for the President in one of his signature priorities?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the President has not been shy about the fact that moving trade promotion authority through the Congress, and if we can reach a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to move that through the Congress, too, because, again, we believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of the U.S. economy and that failing to act on this kind of an agreement, if we can reach one, would be to essentially ratify the status quo.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that, I know, to many Democrats is unacceptable, that there are concerns about the way that companies benefit from the lower labor standards that exist in other countries in a way that puts American businesses at a significant disadvantage.\xc2\xa0 The best way to change that is to enter into a trade agreement that will raise standards and include enforceable provisions that will level the playing field.\xc2\xa0 And by leveling the playing field, the President is confident that American businesses and American workers can\xe2\x80\x99t just compete but they can win in that kind of competition.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is fighting hard to set up, because he knows that, again, if the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t engage we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find China stepping in and tilting the playing field in a way that will put American workers and American businesses at an even more significant disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You need about 17 or 18.\xc2\xa0 Do you like your odds of getting the votes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hazard a guess from here.\xc2\xa0 But I believe that we have a very strong case to make to both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s one that I think the President has demonstrated he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make in person.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When does the administration plan to make good on its promise of about more than a year ago of raising the overtime pay limit?\xc2\xa0 Now at about $23,600.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on any timing. I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of speculation about this particular policy proposal, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot, indeed.\xc2\xa0 And people are kind of waiting, expecting it to happen soon.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.\xc2\xa0 If we have an announcement on this to make, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure you\xe2\x80\x99re among the first to know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got nothing?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it coming soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any timing update at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gee, you\xe2\x80\x99re usually better.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But even you have to admit, that was a little out of left field.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had nothing else.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was inappropriate, just that it was a little out of left field.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can top that.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of Republican governors and some Republican state legislatures that seem to indicate that they would be able to get behind the Obamacare Medicaid expansion if there was some sort of work requirement.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any form of that at all that the administration would consider if it meant that thousands, if not millions, of low-income Americans would then be covered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, the administration has demonstrated a willingness in a variety of settings with Democratic and Republican governors to try to tailor agreements that meet the needs of the population in individual states.\xc2\xa0 So whether it is\xc2\xa0 -- one example that I can think of is, in Arkansas, that there was a lot of resistance in the state legislature to expanding Medicaid; that this administration worked closely with the Democratic governor to reach a bipartisan compromise that had the approval of the Democratic governor, that earned the support and approval of Republicans in the state legislature, and ultimately benefitted thousands of people in the state of Arkansas.</p>\n<p>And I know that that agreement has been used as a template in our negotiations with other states.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is indicative of the commitment that the administration has to working with individual states to do something really important, which is to make sure that thousands of people who currently do not have health care coverage could get it because of this expanded Medicare proposal that was embedded in the Affordable Car Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So work requirements are not a problem?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is something -- this is part of individual conversations that we have with states all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any state that reached an agreement with the administration to put in place a work requirement, but these are the kinds of conversations that the administration has demonstrated a willingness to have, and demonstrated that willingness to have those conversations in a way that has yielded significant benefits for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people across the country who have benefitted from Medicaid expansion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if can just follow up on Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 The President did say to Steve Harvey, and you reiterated at the podium yesterday, that there is a resource diversion that happens if the President goes into a situation that is incendiary, difficult.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s said that before when there were questions raised about why he didn\'t go to North Charleston or to Sanford or to Ferguson, and yet he did not go to those places.\xc2\xa0 And he has also said that -- and other members of his administration have talked about how important it is for him when he gets out and he meets people face-to-face, and he goes into communities and he talks to them.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s also an optical power to that, as well.\xc2\xa0 So why has he never gone to any of those places?\xc2\xa0 And what of the criticism that it is a reluctance to wade deeper into the race issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just start out by pointing out one other fact, that this phenomenon that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in terms of the impact that a presidential visit has on a local community is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve cited in a variety of circumstances; that oftentimes people will say, well, how come the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to go and view the damage from the forest fire firsthand, or why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he visited this community that was struck yesterday by a tornado, and the fact is that in those scenarios, there is significant police presence required to respond to whatever significant event has occurred in that local community, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to draw resources away from that immediate response is the reason that he doesn\'t often go right away.</p>\n<p>So this is a familiar phenomenon and experience -- the point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make here it that\'s not just an excuse, that\'s an actual fact about what happens when the President travels somewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are instances, absolute instances where this President and other Presidents have traveled to the scene of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a fire or a natural disaster or instances where you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But not the day after the tornado.\xc2\xa0 Not the day after.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'re talking about in Baltimore is a couple of days after we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a significant incident.</p>\n<p>Now, I don\'t have any -- I don\'t want to leave you with the impression that in a week or two, we\'re going to wait for things to calm down, the President is automatically going to go.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the current plan.\xc2\xa0 It could be added to the schedule, but that\'s not the current plan.</p>\n<p>And the fact is I think the President has demonstrated a willingness -- and this is what -- I think this is the substance of the question that Michelle was asking, which is the President has been very visible in talking about these incidents when they\xe2\x80\x99ve cropped up in ways that have been very powerful and resonated deeply within these communities, even if the President himself hasn\xe2\x80\x99t set foot in them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an indication of the power of the presidency.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly doesn\'t rule out a presidential visit to a community like Baltimore or Ferguson sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>Lesley.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to kind of stay on Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you were asked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cthug,\xe2\x80\x9d and you said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to walk it back.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering whether the President or his staff have been aware of the racial connotations of that.\xc2\xa0 You had -- Richard Sherman sort of famously talked about it back a year ago or so.\xc2\xa0 Did nobody think about that?\xc2\xa0 Larry Wilmore last night was, \xe2\x80\x9cEt tu, Obama?\xe2\x80\x9d -- raising that.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t usually happen when it\xe2\x80\x99s like riots of school kids, or sport teams reaction vociferously to losses or wins sometimes, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why you haven\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledged that the word might not have been well received.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Lesley, that the President was trying to draw a very clear distinction between individuals who engaged in criminal acts like burning a CVS, or throwing a cinder block at a police officer, from the vast majority of people in the city of Baltimore who found a constructive and appropriate way to publicly raise their concerns about the treatment of Freddie Gray by the Baltimore Police Department.</p>\n<p>And the President is wholly supportive of those citizens who, now not just in Baltimore but in places like New York and Houston and even here in Washington, D.C., where people have taken to the streets in a genuinely peaceful fashion to make their voice heard, and to call for change and to insist for justice for Freddie Gray.\xc2\xa0 That is a legitimate and even honorable expression of one\xe2\x80\x99s views in a responsible fashion and the President strongly supported that.</p>\n<p>The President also went the next step of praising those individuals who actually sought to defuse the violence, that we did see leaders in the community -- many of them were members of the clergy -- who did try to confront those who were engaged in criminal acts and get them to stop.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly believes that their courage in speaking out and trying to prevent that kind of violence and criminal behavior is also worthy of our praise and recognition.</p>\n<p>And the fact is the President did use some tough language to differentiate between the responsible actions of the vast majority from the criminal actions of a very small group of individuals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first black President, did he not realize that there might be some -- people would hear it in a different way, in a different context, and not listen as soon as that word was used?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Lesley, I think it is entirely understandable that when you\'re talking about a subject as complicated as this one, that there might be a few people who get offended by one word or two.\xc2\xa0 What the President was focused on is making sure that his message was delivered.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think there was any misunderstanding what the President was trying to communicate.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, if anything else, is a strong endorsement of the words he chose in answering the question in the Rose Garden on Tuesday or whatever day that was.</p>\n<p>Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that he is just going to get mischaracterized?\xc2\xa0 If he speaks with passion on an issue like this, he is dubbed an angry black man, and yet, if he doesn\'t engage, he is aloof, he is disengaged.\xc2\xa0 And so it doesn\'t matter what he does, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be mischaracterized.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that the strongest endorsement of the way that the President spoke at the news conference on Tuesday is that his powerful message I think was received and I think has resonated across the country.</p>\n<p>And, yes, there have been some people, frankly, on a variety of sides of this issue who have complained about something that the President says.\xc2\xa0 But people complain about what the President says all the time for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 What the President is most interested in is trying to communicate as forcefully and directly and as clearly as he can to the vast majority of the country, and I think in this instance, in making clear that there is a world\xe2\x80\x99s worth of difference between the criminal actions of a small minority and the responsible public expressions of concern by the vast majority of people who are on the streets of Baltimore over the last few days.</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about something that you said very definitively earlier in the briefing.\xc2\xa0 You said that \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitating a ransom payment is not tantamount to paying the ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I wanted you to explain that a little bit further.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to spend -- to explain that in a lot of detail simply because I can\'t talk about all of the tactics and tools that are employed by our law enforcement and intelligence professionals when they take steps to try rescue American hostages.</p>\n<p>But what I can tell you is that our policy about not paying ransoms or making concessions to terrorists is one that has been in place for decades, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change under this President.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that, as painful as it is, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged in the past, is we know that terrorist organizations use ransom payments to fund additional terror activities, and shutting down that financing method is a top priority.</p>\n<p>A few months ago we had David Cohen, who was then a senior official at the Treasury Department responsible for our counterterror finance operations, and he identified in the context of that briefing that ransom payments were a significant concern of ours as it relates to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But this is true -- we know this applies to other terrorist organizations, as well, that they rely on that source of funding to carry out their acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re focused on trying to shut that down.</p>\n<p>Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that this administration -- and this is true of previous administrations, too -- that the FBI, other law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies and the military go to great lengths to try to rescue Americans.\xc2\xa0 And those same agencies are also involved in doing everything they can to try to support the families that are in this terrible situation.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that the President also considers to be a priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the best evidence I have for that is that as much effort as we devote to supporting those families, we\'re currently engaged in a review process to see what more we can do and how we can better support those families that are in that awful situation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve solicited feedback from the families themselves in response to some of the recommendations that have been put forward.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll some more details on that review relatively soon.</p>\n<p>But that is the policy of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s also pretty consistent with common sense.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a clear reason why we don\'t want to -- why we don\'t pay ransoms.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also a clear reason why the President and the law enforcement agencies that are involved in these situations feel an obligation to the families of those who are being held hostage overseas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is okay to facilitate paying a ransom?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 If this was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it okay then to facilitate paying a ransom?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this was a criminal setting and someone paid ransom to get a hostage, and someone then also facilitated the payment of that ransom payment, the person who is the facilitator would be guilty of a criminal conspiracy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I asked that question, to explain why you don\'t think it is tantamount to paying ransom for a hostage.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to follow the analogy that you drew up.\xc2\xa0 I will acknowledge generally speaking that -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this quite a bit in the past.\xc2\xa0 These are difficult situations.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly painful for the families that are in this unthinkable position.\xc2\xa0 And the FBI, our intelligence community, our military, State Department all feel an obligation to try to support these families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But at the same time, there is a common-sense, I think easily understandable law that it\xe2\x80\x99s in place that does not allow the U.S. government to pay a ransom or make concessions to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 And that is a challenge to reconcile those two policies.\xc2\xa0 But on one hand, you have a definitive policy that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken out clearly about many times, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a policy that\'s not going to change.\xc2\xa0 And the question is how do you try to do everything you can to rescue an American that\'s being held hostage and support their family that\'s going through living hell at the same time?\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that our law enforcement agencies, our intel community, our military, and our diplomats go to great lengths to try to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jerry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, earlier you suggested that it\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican priority -- House and Senate Republican priority to pass the TPP. I know that the President met with Democratic Leader in the House Nancy Pelosi yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the New Democrat Coalition today.\xc2\xa0 What kind of outreach, coordination, consolidation of whip counts is the President doing with Republicans in both houses of -- chambers of Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jerry, we continue to stay in touch with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill on this important policy priority.\xc2\xa0 There is a bipartisan proposal that\'s moved through the Senate Finance Committee that has earned strong support from both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We\'re gratified by that initial step.\xc2\xa0 We were certainly pleased to see bipartisan support for the most progressive trade promotion authority bill that has ever advanced through the Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hopeful that that won\xe2\x80\x99t just advance through the Senate Finance Committee* but that it will actually advance through the entire United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 *The House Ways and Means Committee also passed a trade promotion authority bill earlier this month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that process is underway.\xc2\xa0 And the White House and the administration is engaged with Democrats and Republicans to try to facilitate that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Despite having some specific conversations and meetings with Democrats, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing you don\'t have any specific meetings or conversations with Republican leaders to read out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, over the last three or four months, has had a number of meetings with Republicans -- most of which you know about -- in which we acknowledged that the President was talking to them about his legislative priorities that include trade legislation.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s surprising to anybody to know that the President has had those conversations already, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to have them with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your answer earlier you seemed to almost say that it would be -- you said that since they campaigned to get the majority in both chambers of Congress that it would be on Republicans in Congress if the TPP doesn\'t go through.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you were trying to say?\xc2\xa0 Or am I mischaracterizing that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I was just pointing out that there is a little irony associated with the new Republican majority asking the Democratic President for help in passing one of their legislative priorities.</p>\n<p>Now, this President is going to be willing to work with those Republicans to try to advance that specific proposal because it happens to be one of his priorities, as well.\xc2\xa0 But again, presumably Republicans in Congress ran for that job because -- and tried to get the majority because they\'re interested in trying to speed the passage of their agenda through both houses of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, we can hopefully work together to do something that both the Democratic President and the Republican leadership in the Congress acknowledge should be a priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he leaning on maybes or nos to try to make them into yeses the same way he\xe2\x80\x99s doing on the Democratic side of the aisle?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President, again, is having a wide range of conversations with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>In the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First one, back on Bernie Sanders.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that we can expect the kind of public support from the President as he did for Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that the President does not -- I don\'t have any sort of endorsement to offer in the presidential race at this point.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t anticipate that the President has an endorsement to share any time soon.\xc2\xa0 But if that changes, I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of the intense interest among the White House press corps for that kind of news and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s shared promptly with all of you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question, about Charlie Hebdo -- one of the cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo said in an interview that he was offered a meeting at the White House and he declined.\xc2\xa0 Was there any kind of official invitation from the White House?\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 We can check the veracity of that report for you.</p>\n<p>Ali, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to return to the hostage policy one more time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The family of James Foley, back in 2014, cited threats by the U.S. government in relation to them trying to raise money to pay for a ransom.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how does that -- how do you reconcile those allegations with the idea that the FBI or other government agencies may have been trying to facilitate a ransom payment in the case of the Weinstein family?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times when asked this question, I just am not going to go through the understandably confidential conversations that occurred between any of the families that have been in this situation in recent months and the law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals that have worked with them to try to secure the rescue of their loved one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know a lot of people have asked you this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t mean to belabor it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to anyway.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s sort of what we do around here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a crass analogy, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t this kind of an attempt to split the baby in terms of you have one official policy which is you don\'t offer ransoms but that at the other time, you have these things which you understandably say you can\'t get into but that may be somewhat contradictory to that official position.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I guess what I will acknowledge is that these are the kinds of policy dilemmas that crop up on a -- basically on a daily basis around here.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it seems like hourly.\xc2\xa0 In this case, we\'re talking about a particularly challenging one given the emotions that involved; that we\'re talking about a very human situation when you have families who are waiting on pins and needles, worried to death about the safety and well-being of their loved one who is being held hostage overseas.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it is a credit to our law enforcement officials and to our counterterrorism officials that they feel an obligation to use their expertise and their capabilities to support these families.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they should do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President wants them to do.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, that\'s why the President ordered a review, is to see what more we can do and how we can better support them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has also demonstrated his own willingness to go to great lengths to try to rescue American hostages.\xc2\xa0 So we obviously have the example from last summer, where the President, as you all know now, and as has been widely reported, ordered a raid into Syria, to put boots on the ground in Syria to try to rescue American hostages there.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, that raid, while conducted consistent with the strategy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t result in the rescue of American hostages.\xc2\xa0 But there have been other situations where there have been daring raids undertaken and have resulted in the rescue of Americans who were being held hostage.</p>\n<p>I\'ll remind you of the situation of Jessica Buchanan, who was held in Africa.\xc2\xa0 And the President ordered a military operation to put boots on the ground in a foreign land in a dangerous place to secure her rescue.\xc2\xa0 And the President was delighted, and I think the American people were delighted, that that rescue was successful and allowed her to safely return.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, each of these situations haven\'t ended that way.\xc2\xa0 But against all of that is a policy that\'s been in place for decades that is clearly in the best interest of our national security, and that is a policy that does not allow the federal government to pay ransom or otherwise make concessions to hostages [sic].\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, I think people who take sort of an unbiased look at this do acknowledge that this is a thorny policy problem and one that has significant implications for our broader national security, but in some cases, the life of an American citizen who is in a very vulnerable situation.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly takes this seriously, but just as importantly, our law enforcement officials, our military officials and our intelligence officials who are responsible for reacting to these kinds of situations take it seriously as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\'re talking about this particular instance today because of a Wall Street Journal report, but I would anticipate that once we have completed this hostage policy review that we\'ll have an opportunity to consider some of the recommendations of that review and we\'ll have another briefing like this one where we\'ll have an opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of the way that this is implemented.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that even after that review has been completed, one thing that will not change is our no ransom, no concessions policy.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:30 P.M.
