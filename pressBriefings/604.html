EDT</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here for your White House briefing.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I have a couple of announcements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">First, I\'d like to note that yesterday, Majority Leader Reid filed cloture on several qualified nominees, including Patricia Millett, who is the first of three nominees that have been nominated to serve as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Millett, a military spouse, is a leading appellate lawyer.\xc2\xa0 Only one woman has argued before the Supreme Court more often than she has.\xc2\xa0 And she is supported by an impressive list of bipartisan lawyers, as well as leaders from the law enforcement and business communities.</p>\n<p class="p3">While some cynically raise the workload of the court, it is important to keep in mind that Millett would fill the ninth seat of this 11-member court.\xc2\xa0 The last time the Senate confirmed a judge to the ninth seat was in 2003, when the court had almost 50 percent fewer pending appeals, compared to today, and yet John Roberts was confirmed by voice vote -- that John Roberts.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the Senate later confirmed the 10th and 11th seats with President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s nominees.\xc2\xa0 So we urge the Senate to follow that precedent to give this enormously qualified nominee a confirmation vote. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Secondly, I\'d like to note that a new report released by the Department of Health and Human Services shows good news for young adults under the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The report looked at 18-34-year-olds in 34 states and found that nearly half of single young adults who are uninsured may be able to get coverage for $50 or less per month in the health insurance marketplaces in 2014, and nearly 7 out of 10 of single young adults who are uninsured may be able to pay $100 or less per month for coverage in 2014.</p>\n<p class="p3">According to the report, an additional 1 million eligible uninsured single young adults may qualify for Medicaid in the states that have opted to expand that program next year.\xc2\xa0 This is good news for young adults who have been priced out of the market in the past or could not get affordable coverage because of a preexisting condition, or decided to risk it and then ended up tens of thousands of dollars in debt after an accident.</p>\n<p class="p3">Today\xe2\x80\x99s report also shows that if more expanded their Medicaid programs, the number of young adults who could get low-cost coverage would be even greater.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, if all 34 states that are run by the federal government or in partnership with states were to expand Medicaid, about 4.9 million uninsured single young adults would be eligible for Medicaid instead of 1 million.\xc2\xa0 So think about that -- and additional 3.9 million single young adults would be eligible for Medicaid, would receive that security from the coverage provided by Medicaid, if those other states were to expand their programs, as some have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, because of the Affordable Care Act, young adults can shop for quality, affordable coverage for themselves and their families and they may get a tax credit to make it even more affordable.\xc2\xa0 So that is good news, indeed.</p>\n<p class="p3">With that, I\'ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie Pace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report that the spying that\'s been revealed in France and Spain was actually done by intelligence services in those countries, not by the NSA.\xc2\xa0 And since the administration has said that there were unspecified inaccuracies in some of the reports about these revelations, can you say that if that is what you were talking about, that this spying was done by French and --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want me to specify what the unspecified inaccuracies might be?\xc2\xa0 We have important cooperative relationships with the security agencies and intelligence agencies of other nations, of allied nations, and I\'m not going to get into the specific alleged activities -- intelligence activities -- of the United States or our allies.</p>\n<p class="p3">We\'re obviously, more broadly, engaged in a review, as I discussed at length yesterday, of our intelligence-gathering activities, mindful of the fact that because of the explosion in our technological capacities, we need to look at and make sure that we are not just gathering intelligence because we can, but we\'re gathering it because we need it, specifically.\xc2\xa0 And that review is underway, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, and will be completed by the end of the year.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the things that officials say is under review is the surveillance of ally heads of state.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan to conduct this review and tell the public of its outcomes all at once, or is it possible that we could learn in days or a shorter timeframe of the decision on that specific program, the head of state surveillance?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, generally speaking, you should expect that upon conclusion of the review we will endeavor to make public as much information as possible, mindful of the fact that these are national security programs and national security operations and intelligence matters that, almost by definition, demand that not everything be revealed about them.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a long way of answering that I think you would expect us to have much more to say at the conclusion of the review than we can say now.</p>\n<p class="p3">I can tell you that in the course of the review, some decisions have been made about our intelligence-gathering activities even as we proceed with it, and some of those decisions have been made and are being implemented.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not going to get into details about those issues or all of the activities that are under review until we come to a conclusion about the way we can balance those security and privacy concerns.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If some decisions have been made and you have this uproar both overseas and on Capitol Hill, why not make public some of what you are changing to show people that you are taking action?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are engaged in direct communications through diplomatic channels with a number of countries on these matters.\xc2\xa0 And a number of countries have, as you know, expressed concerns about the reports, the disclosures that have emanated in the wake of the unauthorized leaking of classified information, so that communication is happening and it\'s robust.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And as I said yesterday, we understand the concerns that have been raised, and we are working with our friends and allies to discuss these matters, to explain what we\'re doing in terms of the review that we\'re engaged in, and to continue to focus on the cooperative relationships that we have when it comes to intelligence-gathering -- because it\'s important to remember, as I said yesterday, that the purpose of this intelligence collection is to enhance the security of the American people and the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that are taken by the intelligence community and the information they collect helps the United States protect lives, and protect the lives of our allies, the citizens of those countries, and vice versa.\xc2\xa0 We rely enormously on efforts undertaken by our friends and allies, by their intelligence services; we share information and together, we enhance each other\'s security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Having said that, it\'s important to note, as the President has, that we should go about this review of our intelligence-gathering activities, mindful of all of our security needs and demands but also of the need for balancing those demands against the sincere privacy concerns that Americans and others share.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to see if I could yield what little was left of my time to Roger, who has to take off with the pool shortly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roger, it is great to see you.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thank the gentlelady from the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Following up on Julie\'s question, Senator Feinstein said yesterday that she had been told that the data collection on the allies will not continue.\xc2\xa0 Is that one of those decisions that\'s been made?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we consult regularly with Chairman Feinstein as a part of our ongoing engagement with the Congress on national security matters and we appreciate her continued leadership on these issues as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to statements that Senator Feinstein has made, I would refer you to her about them.</p>\n<p class="p3">What we\'ve made clear is that we are undertaking a review of our activities around the world with a special emphasis on examining whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state, examining how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners, and examining what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts.\xc2\xa0 So the review encompasses a lot of activity, but there is an emphasis -- a special emphasis on those areas.</p>\n<p class="p3">Beyond that, the review is ongoing, so I\'m not going to discuss the details or the outcomes -- going back to Julie\'s question -- until it\xe2\x80\x99s completed.\xc2\xa0 But as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some decisions, the President has made some decisions, and I would expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make more as this process continues.\xc2\xa0 And then, when it\xe2\x80\x99s over, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about the decisions we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out the accuracy of what she --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just refer you to Chairman Feinstein about that.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, the cyber meeting this morning with CEOs, did the President give the chief executives some sort of idea of the draft standards that are supposed to be coming out?\xc2\xa0 And how did they react?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, that meeting ended not long ago, and the meeting focused with CEOs from the financial, energy, defense, and information technology sectors on cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 The President was there, as well as senior White House and National Security Council staff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a full readout yet, Roger, but I understand that they discussed the implementation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive order on improving critical infrastructure, cybersecurity, and particularly the preliminary, voluntary cybersecurity framework that has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in partnership with industry.</p>\n<p class="p4">The preliminary framework, which is intended to provide voluntary guidance for industry to encourage companies to adopt sound cybersecurity practices, was released last week and published in the Federal Register today and is open for public comment.\xc2\xa0 The companies that met with the President were among those that worked most closely on the framework.\xc2\xa0 And this meeting is part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing dialogue with the private sector on cybersecurity, which is an issue, as you know, that has received a great deal of attention from the President and the rest of the administration because it is of such great importance to our national security and to our broader interests.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction from them?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to them for their reaction. But the President certainly appreciated the meeting.</p>\n<p class="p4">Yes, Roberta.\xc2\xa0 Wait.\xc2\xa0 Roger, are you good?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain in just really clear and plain terms the disconnect between what the President said about if you want to keep your plan you can keep it, and what we see people complaining about, which is being kicked out of their plan or being told they have to buy a more expensive plan, or just general unhappiness in that segment?\xc2\xa0 Can you explain that?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question and I thank you for the opportunity to explain this.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of attention being focused on it and that it deserves fuller explanation -- and I think fuller explanation by us and fuller explanation by everybody reporting on it, so that viewers and readers and listeners are getting the full picture about this issue.</p>\n<p class="p4">So let\xe2\x80\x99s step back.\xc2\xa0 If you are one of the 80 percent of the American people who receive insurance coverage through your employer or through Medicaid or Medicare or the Veterans Administration, this conversation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to you.\xc2\xa0 These reports do not apply to you.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the 15 percent of the American people who are uninsured entirely right now, this conversation does not apply to you.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is the 5 percent in the country who currently purchase insurance on the individual market.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And that market has been like the Wild West.\xc2\xa0 It has been under regulated.\xc2\xa0 It is the place where Americans have most keenly felt the challenges posed by the insurance system in this country, where, for example, insurers could deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition, or they could offer you coverage that in its fine print excluded benefits specifically related to your preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 So if you have hypertension or you\xe2\x80\x99re a cancer survivor, they could carve out coverage on those specific issues and then give you a plan that would cover you on other things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">They could also, and did, routinely, change your plan or eliminate it altogether, annually.\xc2\xa0 They could throw you off.\xc2\xa0 They could jack up your premiums.\xc2\xa0 They could change your coverage.\xc2\xa0 And one of the issues that the Affordable Care Act was designed to address was the need to provide greater security to those Americans who had no other option but to seek insurance on the individual market.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So that\xe2\x80\x99s the universe we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about:\xc2\xa0 5 percent of the population.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know that, because in some of the coverage of this issue in the last several days, you would think that you were talking about 75 percent or 80 percent or 60 percent of the American population.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the law says, and as the President made clear in the statements that you cite, if you had insurance coverage on the individual market when the Affordable Care Act was passed into law and you liked that plan and you wanted to stay on it, even though it didn\'t meet the minimum standards that the Affordable Care Act would bring into place on January 1, 2014, you can keep the coverage.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re grandfathered in.\xc2\xa0 That plan and your association with it are grandfathered in, in perpetuity -- not for a year, not for five years, but forever.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is not the case is if your insurer basically threw you off that plan by telling you after a year or two that it was changing and said, here\xe2\x80\x99s your new option because your plan has changed, that that new plan is grandfathered in.\xc2\xa0 Because how could that be?\xc2\xa0 You can\'t grandfather in a plan in 2010 that didn\'t come into existence until 2012 or 2011?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s the insurers that are at fault is what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about fault.\xc2\xa0 The insurers, in the lead-up to the creation of these marketplaces, were doing what they\xe2\x80\x99d always done, based on the incentives that existed in the existing insurance market for individuals.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The good news is that for every one of these individuals who might have a plan that is almost by definition providing less than minimal benefits, and that may, as is normally the case, charge you twice as much if you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman, or penalize you because of your age or because of a preexisting condition, you now are being offered a variety of options, including options by the very insurer that covers you today, for new coverage.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is also true is that you can look at those options and then go and check what your qualification might be for tax credits, and you might discover, as a significant portion of this 5 percent will discover, that you\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to pay less come January for better coverage than what you\xe2\x80\x99re paying now for far worse coverage.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a story the other morning that highlighted this phenomenon, the sending of letters, that featured a woman in Florida who was worried because she could not continue coverage under her existing plan.\xc2\xa0 And as reported, it made it sound like she had a plan and she wanted to keep it, but she couldn\'t.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that would be that this is a new plan that has been created since the Affordable Care Act passed, or that she dropped coverage and reinstated it, again, after the Affordable Care Act passed.\xc2\xa0 But what the report didn\'t say is that her plan doesn\'t cover her for hospital visits; that her plan is basically one of the most basic kinds of plans available that provide almost no security.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what we stipulate that the Affordable Care Act, as campaigned on by the President, as the health care reform that he campaigned on, and as drafted and passed into law by Congress and signed into law by the President, and upheld by the Supreme Court, was designed specifically to protect those Americans who were getting a raw deal in the existing insurance market, and protect them by ensuring that everybody could get affordable coverage, or the universe of people who could affordable coverage would expand greatly, and that that coverage would provide basic benefits that are not currently covered in many of these plans.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to explain all that when you\xe2\x80\x99re writing about it, and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a TV package on it -- two minutes it not a long time.\xc2\xa0 But it is important to remember the context here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 5 percent, and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- when you look at what actually happened since the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the clause that allows you to grandfather in, the fact is that millions of Americans who have been subject to the whims and vagaries of this individual insurance market are going to have security that they\xe2\x80\x99ve never had before, and better coverage, in most cases, than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before, and cheaper coverage, in many cases, than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So people who are unhappy are misinformed about the quality of the insurance that they have?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, every individual story has a story behind it.\xc2\xa0 So someone may not have had insurance coverage when the Affordable Care Act passed, or maybe they were covered by their employer.\xc2\xa0 So maybe last year they lost their employer coverage or they lost their job or they changed jobs, and now they don\xe2\x80\x99t get employer coverage.\xc2\xa0 And they saw and purchased a plan on the individual market, an individual market that provides very few options and very little desirable coverage at affordable costs.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is certainly the case is that come January 1st, 2014, plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t provide these basic benefits, plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t provide maternity care, plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t provide mental health care, plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t provide other preventive services, plans that place caps on your annual benefits or caps on your lifetime benefits -- all of those can no longer exist, because the purpose here was to create some minimum benefits for the American people so that they could enjoy the security of health insurance coverage, quality health insurance coverage.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for people who were on a plan when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law and who want to keep that plan, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed on that plan, and the insurer hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pulled that plan away from them and replaced it with something else in the interim that does not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act, they can keep that plan if they so choose.\xc2\xa0 They may want to investigate their options on the marketplaces, because in so many cases those options are superior to their existing plan.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The context and the caveats that you just presented there about the President\xe2\x80\x99s repeated claim that if you like your plan you can keep it was never really mentioned to the American people when the President was time and again saying this in the run-up to the passage of that law.\xc2\xa0 Is an essential question here, Jay, did the President mislead the American people when he made that comment repeatedly?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, no, the President was clear about a basic fact:\xc2\xa0 If you had insurance that you liked on the individual market and you wanted to keep that insurance through 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and in perpetuity if you wanted it and it was available, you could -- you were grandfathered in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What no health care reform could envision or could responsibly stipulate is that any plan that might come along in the next few years would be grandfathered in, because that would undermine that basic premise of providing the minimum benefits for the American people.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, in all of these cases, what is absolutely true is that if you had a plan before the Affordable Care Act that you liked on the individual market, and your insurance company didn\xe2\x80\x99t take that away from you and offer you instead something else that you then purchased, but they provided you the same plan this would time, you can keep it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s true and if you\'re -- again, I would encourage you and others to --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are people out there who don\'t -- or who do like their plan, as crummy as it might be, in the views of this White House.\xc2\xa0 Those folks are not being able to keep their plan in some of these cases in the individual market because it does not meet the requirements of the law as it stands now or as it will be next year.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\'t understand how you can say that the President\'s claim back in 2009 and 2010, if you like your plan you can keep it, was an accurate claim.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, again you\'re --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because there are people now who are now losing their insurance.\xc2\xa0 It just doesn\'t --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Jim, you\'re basically saying that if somebody bought a plan on December 15th that did not provide hospital coverage, did not provide maternity benefits, charged your sister -- if you have one -- double what they charged you, even if she is a twin and genetically the same --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re a 27-year-old male who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want maternity coverage or isn\'t worried about being put in the hospital?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, isn\'t worried about being put in the hospital?\xc2\xa0 That is precisely the point, because there are 27-year-olds out there --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His choice.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that goes to the fundamental debate about whose responsibility it is to cover the cost of that 27-year-old when he or she ends up in the emergency room.\xc2\xa0 Because if he\xe2\x80\x99s not covered or she\xe2\x80\x99s not covered, you\'re paying the costs and you\'re paying the costs and I\'m paying the costs.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not fair to taxpayers who deal with those costs or to individuals on the private insurance market who absorb those costs through their own insurance plans.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this isn\'t really a new issue.\xc2\xa0 PolitiFact said back in 2010 that this was "half-true."\xc2\xa0 Factcheck.org said, "The President can\'t make this claim" back in 2009.\xc2\xa0 So there are questions about this claim --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, wait.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying, on the one hand, people didn\'t know, and on the other hand they did.\xc2\xa0 So the claim the President was making, the only claim we could make, because we couldn\'t predict what plans would exist between the passage of the law and the full implementation of it, was that if you had a plan prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act that you like, you could keep that plan and stay on it even if you might get a better deal with better benefits through the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is true -- and there was a debate about this and I\'m sure there will continue to be a debate that a fundamental premise of the Affordable Care Act is that there ought to be minimum standards for insurance coverage for everybody.\xc2\xa0 And that is what the marketplaces provide.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the top Democrats in the House, Steny Hoyer, said this morning, "I think preciseness would have been better." He was making that comment about the President\'s claim if you like your plan you can keep it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I appreciate that and as I was saying --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Steny Hoyer missing --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to another reporter, look, if you want to make that point, you can.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ve explained exactly what was possible when the law was written.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t grandfather in plans that didn\'t exist.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t grandfather in people who didn\'t have insurance and then bought it in the interim.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some precision might have been better on the President\'s part.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, again, you can focus on that level, or if you do --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s an important point to focus on, Jay --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, focus on it --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President said time and again to sell the health care law to the American people, and it was something that reassured millions of Americans out there that their plan would not be changed.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not something that we\'re just picking on one little thing here to make a big political point or conflate --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I ask is that when you do the report, you note that anybody who had a plan the day before the Affordable Care Act passed and was signed into law, and has not been thrown off that plan and had it replaced by their insurer, has not dropped coverage of their own volition and then purchased it again in the interim, but has had that plan, is grandfathered in and can keep that plan.\xc2\xa0 That is what we were saying and that is a fact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Also, when you do this story, just please remember that the universe you\'re talking about here is 5 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole individual insurance market -- 5 percent of the population. And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important 5 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a 5 percent that is of outsized concern to the drafters and implementers of the Affordable Care Act because they\'re the ones -- those are the Americans who have been most subject to the wild vagaries of the system as it existed before the Affordable Care Act, who at the drop of a hat could have lost coverage or been told that their premiums were doubling, or that they would have no longer been able to get coverage for a specific condition because it was preexisting.\xc2\xa0 All that changes come January 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Finally, does the President regret making that claim?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think I\'ve answered the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe he should have been more precise?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President said, as many others said, that if you had a plan that you liked on the individual insurance market -- and, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the individual insurance market.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if you\'re on a plan that your employer provides or if you\'re on Medicare and you like it -- as virtually every recipient of Medicare seems to -- or Medicaid, or you get benefits through the VA -- again, when you report this, make that clear -- all of these populations are not affected by what happens on the individual market.\xc2\xa0 But if you had a plan on the individual market and you liked it and you like it, and you\'ve kept it, you can keep it forever as long as your insurer offers it.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t -- you have to remember --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s your requirements.\xc2\xa0 It\'s your law\'s requirements that are putting insurers in that situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I stipulate that -- and I think it\'s important to talk to insurers, Jim, because if you ask them do they want those consumers, those customers out there who are now shopping around for the options available to them on the individual market -- options that, almost by definition, are superior to the ones they\'ve had before -- the answer the insurers will tell you is, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And they are going to aggressively pursue those customers, because the Affordable Care Act has changed the entire dynamic of the marketplace so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a marketplace in which it is the sensible business decision for insurers to deny coverage to you if you\'re sick, or charge a woman twice the price, or refuse basic services like maternity care or mental health services.\xc2\xa0 It is in their interest now to sign up as many customers as they can, because this system now allows for individuals on this market to purchase affordable health insurance that they haven\'t been able to purchase before.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can switch subjects -- is the United States now listening in on the phone conversations of friendly presidents and prime ministers?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, Jon, I\'m not going to get into a discussion of specific reported activities, intelligence-reporting activities.\xc2\xa0 What I --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that we\'re listening in on the phone conversations of friendly heads of state?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jon, I\'m not going to talk about specific alleged or reported intelligence-gathering operations.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the review that the President initiated and that has been ongoing for some time now has as an emphasis on an examination of our practices vis-\xc3\xa0-vis heads of state, as well as --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have told us you\'re not listening in on Angela Merkel\'s phone calls.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I\'m asking.\xc2\xa0 So can you say the same thing about Prime Minister Netanyahu?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we read out a phone call that the President had with Chancellor Merkel, and read that out, including the assurances he gave her about the fact that the United States is not and will not gather information on her communications.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he given similar assurances to President Hollande or Prime Minister Abe or --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific about specific alleged operations or conversations the President may or may not have had with foreign leaders.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the review is focused in part on this issue within the broader context of the overall review, which is looking at where we\xe2\x80\x99ve come in these past 10 or 12 years in the post-9/11 world where our security needs have grown substantially and our capacities have grown, as have the capacities of those who would do us harm when it comes to communications.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So this is the kind of thing that merits review.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President initiated it, and he wants to make sure that the way we conduct our intelligence-gathering activities is measured against or balanced against the privacy concerns that Americans share with our allies and others.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just two things on Senator Feinstein.\xc2\xa0 The first is Senator Feinstein said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a statement that the President agrees with -- a principle that he agrees with?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, these are excellent questions, and I would simply say that these are issues that are under review.\xc2\xa0 And I cannot discuss specific reported operations.\xc2\xa0 I think that if you step back and look at that, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable why.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that the concerns raised by some of our allies cause us concern, and we have been engaged with our allies in direct, diplomatic communications about these issues because these are important relationships.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is broadly true, too -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about a specific reported activity -- but it is broadly true, too, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, that we gather foreign intelligence much as much nations gather foreign intelligence.\xc2\xa0 So I think we have to stipulate that, as well.\xc2\xa0 And we also have to remember that the purpose here is to protect the American people and protect the United States and protect our allies.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the fundamental mission that the NSA and the other agencies that are a part of the intelligence community have, and they work every day very hard on behalf of the American people to try to fulfill that mission.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just finally clarify, Senator Feinstein -- this was brought up earlier -- Senator Feinstein said that the White House had informed her \xe2\x80\x9ccollection on our allies will not continue.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So just a simple question:\xc2\xa0 Is Senator Feinstein correct?\xc2\xa0 This is her statement, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve already gone to her office.\xc2\xa0 So don\'t refer me back to her.\xc2\xa0 This is what she said.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 No, I get it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we have ongoing conversations and consultations with Chairman Feinstein.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specific conversations to read out to you, but we appreciate her leadership on her committee and her leadership on these issues, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to consult with on these issues.\xc2\xa0 We are conducting a review that goes right at -- with some specificity -- the matters that you raise.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on NSA, Chairman Leahy and Jay Amash put together a bipartisan piece of legislation called the Freedom Act, which seems to accomplish a couple of things I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your comment on:\xc2\xa0 Ending what they describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cdragnet collection of phone records under Section 215;\xe2\x80\x9d and to appoint a special advocate before the FISA review process for future collection of intelligence-related data.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got 70 co-sponsors in the House, 16 in the Senate, bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 White House support it?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not in a position to discuss specific legislation, but I can tell you that in August, the President announced that the administration will work with Congress to pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that there are steps that can be taken to give the American people confidence that there are additional safeguards applied to that program, that section of the Patriot Act, to prevent abuse. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">For example, steps could be taken to put in place greater oversight, greater transparency, and more constraints on the use of the authority provided within Section 215.\xc2\xa0 The administration is also working with Congress to improve the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in the oversight conducted by the FISA Court, which goes to the other piece of the legislation that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congress.\xc2\xa0 There are others who are looking at possible legislation on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And this is an ongoing dialogue, again, part of an overall process that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in to look at the way we gather intelligence, make reforms that are necessary, or propose them, and also to ever be mindful of the fact that programs that are authorized under Section 215, for example, serve a very specific purpose in providing valuable intelligence to help keep the American people and the country safe.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did this consultative process interact with the drafting of this legislation?\xc2\xa0 Did they run any of these things by you?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House find anything objectionable about this?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give them any indication --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge any legislation at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because obviously there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one effort underway here, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing consultative conversation happening between the administration and Congress on these matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Generally speaking, as I just noted, the President is supportive of the idea that we need to make some reforms to increase the confidence the American people have in these programs and to perhaps provide greater oversight and greater transparency, as well as more constraints on the authorities that exist under this program.\xc2\xa0 And I say that because you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about making improvements to a program that in and of itself has intelligence value when it comes to keeping the American people and the country safe.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for the Affordable Care Act, Valerie Jarrett sent out a tweet last night saying nothing in the Affordable Care Act is requiring any of these changes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see if you could just say -- understand how many in the American public would say, wait a minute, the law itself creates the means by which the administration judges whether an individual insurance policy has changed sufficiently to meet the standards -- meaning if you\xe2\x80\x99re after the grandfathering period, and something about the coverage changed, then the administration can judge whether or not that qualifies for the grandfathering exemption.\xc2\xa0 So the administration is evolved in evaluating whether or not this coverage does or does not meet the standards, and whether people have to receive a cancellation notice.\xc2\xa0 Is that not true?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 That would be true a year from now or five years from now, if an insurer put forward a plan and asked if it met the standards and it did not meet the standards -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide maternity care, or it didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide mental health services, or it tried to impose annual caps, or something like that, the answer would be, no, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the standards.\xc2\xa0 So the only thing that could be done, when the law was written, is that --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the regulations enforcement, right?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, right.\xc2\xa0 But the point that she was making and that I and others made last night and I\xe2\x80\x99m making today is that, as written, the law granted a grandfather status to individuals who had insurance on the individual market before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and kept that insurance and wanted to keep it for as long as they were alive, if the insurer wanted to have them on that plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But if the insurer, last year or the year before or earlier this year, told -- let\xe2\x80\x99s say, it\xe2\x80\x99s you -- that guess what, your plan that you signed up for for a year, we\xe2\x80\x99re changing --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has a higher premium or --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- reduced benefits or anything --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the administration steps in and says, we judge that to be a significant --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t step in.\xc2\xa0 The insurance company understands, and has understood since the passage --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a significant enough change, and so now that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer grandfathered.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the process, is it not?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the agency here, I think the insurer is making the decision to basically cancel the plan and reissue or offer the individual a new plan with different benefits or different costs.\xc2\xa0 So the insurer makes that call, and made that call over the course of the -- since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And then individuals on this very volatile and difficult market made the decision as to whether to continue on that plan or to see if there was anything else available to them in this difficult market that will be vastly improved come January 1st.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember both before the ACA was ever even a gleam in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s eye, let alone passed into law, that insurance companies were doing this all the time, especially in the individual market because it was lightly regulated and the incentives were so skewed.\xc2\xa0 That will change and is changing.\xc2\xa0 And I think, to credit the insurers, you are seeing -- and they deserve this -- because you are seeing them actively solicit customers to the new offerings that they have that meet the general minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act, that provide these basic services, and which allow individuals on this market to shop around in a way that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t before, and then look at the tax credits that may be available to them -- up to half of them, based on some of the analysis out there -- which would result, in many cases, in insurance coverage that is far superior and cheaper than what they had before, if they had it.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, to summarize, one of the goals was to essentially get rid of this Wild West, as you describe it, to eradicate the individual market and all the vagaries and --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99re expanding vastly the individual market.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Picking up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, there are, as you said, some people who choose not to have coverage because they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it applies to them -- in some cases, it absolutely doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to them, or they\xe2\x80\x99re accepting the risk of not taking on certain coverage, and those consumer decisions are being flattened in order to conform with the law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true, is it not?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I follow you.\xc2\xa0 But on the question that Jim raised and that I think you just raised again, are there young invincibles out there, 27-year-olds, for example, because up to 26 now, thanks to the Affordable --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or a 54-year-old that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need maternity coverage.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are basic requirements of the Affordable Care Act for basic coverage in a plan.\xc2\xa0 And mental health services and not being able to be kicked off for a preexisting condition or denied coverage -- the list is long, and it is important to many people who need that security.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is true is that -- on the issue that Jim and you just raised on the so-called young invincibles -- yes, if you\xe2\x80\x99re 27 or 28, and you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get hurt, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll just depend on the emergency room if you do, the Affordable Care Act says you should be covered.\xc2\xa0 We had that debate and that\xe2\x80\x99s a sincere and important debate to have in the Affordable Care Act that was passed into law -- signed into law, upheld by the Supreme Court, and validated through a national election -- because we believe that the -- and the premise of that part of the Affordable Care Act if founded on the idea that the taxpayer should not foot the bill for the decisions by some to take that chance, because you could be young and healthy at 27, or you could be like somebody roughly that age that I know very well who just found out he had cancer, and fortunately he has coverage.\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, and if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, you would be faced with enormous expenses and probably substandard care, and a lot of those expenses potentially could be shifted onto taxpayers.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act was designed to make the improvements necessary so that that kind of insecurity is no longer prevalent in so many Americans\xe2\x80\x99 lives.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, first on NSA.\xc2\xa0 A moment ago, you entertained a hypothetical by saying -- you used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbroadly true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In general, there are certain things that happen --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I said \xe2\x80\x9cbroadly true,\xe2\x80\x9d but okay.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Broadly true.\xc2\xa0 In general, surveillance of key allies is so extraordinary that something of that magnitude would be put in the presidential daily brief, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked this yesterday and I stipulate that it is a valid question, but I simply cannot talk about the contents of the President\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence briefings, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into specific alleged or reported operations of U.S. intelligence services.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the issue that you raised is one that is specifically emphasized in the review that the President initiated by the White House, concurrent with two other reviews that are being undertaken independently of the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I know that is less than would be the ideal answer, but given that we\'re talking about intelligence-gathering activities, I simply can\'t get into specific alleged activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the notion that the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know about this for potentially years would seem odd.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, to engage in that discussion would be to engage in a discussion of activities involving intelligence-gathering that have been recently alleged reported, and I just -- I can\'t do that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that when it comes to actions involving other heads of state that is part of the review that\xe2\x80\x99s being undertaken.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically, on what Major just asked on health care, about Valerie Jarrett\'s tweet last night -- the first sentence, "Nothing in Obamacare forces people out of their health plans."\xc2\xa0 I understand the long context that you had, which is important, but specifically, in fact, it is the law, the President\'s health care law, that is forcing insurance companies to make these changes.\xc2\xa0 So isn\'t that law leading to these cancellation notices, for better or for worse?\xc2\xa0 It may work in the long term, but this law is forcing those letters.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just indulge -- please ask you to indulge me for one moment.\xc2\xa0 The issue here -- if you\'re asking does the Affordable Care Act, as written, passed and signed into law, and upheld by the Supreme Court, demand that there is basic coverage for every American when it comes to their health insurance options, the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 That was, in many ways, the whole point.\xc2\xa0 So the answer to that is yes.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What Valerie and others were responding to was reports that these individual who had gotten letters from their insurance companies were getting those letters because the Affordable Care Act forced the insurers to write those letters.\xc2\xa0 The only reason why those letters have to be written is because the insurers either changed plans -- in other words, canceled one plan and offered another that the insured purchased -- during this interim period since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or individuals purchased individual coverage since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And I guess the point is we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grandfather in plans and individuals who didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist at the moment of passage.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So the good news for everybody on this market is that there are now going to be -- there\'s going to be a vast increase in options available to them.\xc2\xa0 All of them will contain minimum standards of coverage that so many plans on the individual market now do not meet.\xc2\xa0 And for the first time, you can\'t be thrown off your plan because you get sick.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t be told that you\'re no longer getting benefits because you\'ve hit an annual or lifetime cap that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know you had because it was buried in the reams of paperwork that you signed.\xc2\xa0 And you can\'t be charged double because you\'re a woman, which was standard practice prior to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So circling back to your basic question, does the Affordable Care Act, when implemented, require minimum standards for coverage?\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And so Jonathan Chait, who\'s usually friendly to the administration, has an article, column in New York Magazine today saying "they are receiving those notices because the regulations Obama promised ended the individual insurance market as we know it."\xc2\xa0 And he suggested Valerie\'s tweet is absurd, because it ended the way that market ended.\xc2\xa0 So when you say nothing in Obamacare caused that, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 That was the whole point of the law.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, again, I\'m not going to challenge this in the sense that -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s the point, the fundamental point which Jonathan and others make, that the Affordable Care Act creates a minimum standard for all insurance plans, the answer is, of course it does.\xc2\xa0 There was 18 months of debate about this before it passed.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been much discussion about the Affordable Care Act since.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What is also true is that, as the law states, if you had a plan on the individual market that you wanted to keep, you could keep it.\xc2\xa0 But the law could not order insurers not to cancel that plan, which, based on the way the individual market existed prior to the Affordable Care Act, they did all the time, and then said, well, guess what, Ed, we signed this contract for a year, your year is up, and if you want to keep insurance with us, we\'re going to double your premiums or we\'re going to do away with coverage for your knee or whatever it is -- they certainly had the ability to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And if they did that and the individual then said, well, I don\'t really have any options -- but I\'m looking forward to having options when the Affordable Care Act is implemented -- but I don\'t really have any options now, I take what you give me --\xc2\xa0 then, yes, that plan does not meet the minimum standards of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And, therefore, people, again -- and I trust FOX will report this -- the 5 percent of the population that is affected by this is now --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 5 percent is 14 million people, by the way, which is not a small --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And these are incredibly important people.\xc2\xa0 These are the people for whom these marketplaces are being created, for whom better coverage and affordable prices are being created, the people who have lived with great insecurity for too long.\xc2\xa0 So, absolutely, they\'re important people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the basic point is for those people who have been told by their insurance companies that the plan they currently have doesn\'t meet the standards, they\'re being offered alternatives.\xc2\xa0 And they are also, many of them, qualified to receive substantial tax credits, which will make that better insurance coverage affordable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think we talked about this, but I think the coverage you cited to me from another network in yesterday\'s briefing and the story of a woman in Florida left out -- both the coverage by the other network and in your question -- that that woman\'s plan covered nothing in terms of hospital visits.\xc2\xa0 She goes to the hospital, she goes bankrupt.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not quality insurance coverage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the Affordable Care Act makes sure that if you pay for a plan, you get decent coverage.\xc2\xa0 There are grades of coverage available.\xc2\xa0 But the most basic coverage covers your hospital visits, covers maternity care, covers mental health services.\xc2\xa0 That\'s very important to millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just spent several minutes with me and others providing all this wonderful context.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder then why --\xc2\xa0 specifically with the President -- in September of 2009, "I want to spend a few minutes debunking some of the more outrageous myths circulating on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 If you like your private health insurance plan, you can keep your plan, period."</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s the same quote I think that I had read to me earlier.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do the President\'s word\'s matter when he sells a big thing like this?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, again, all I ask of FOX and everybody is to provide the context.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\'t provide that context back then.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There has been essentially five years of debate about this, and there was 18 months of intense debate about what the Affordable Care Act did and did not do at the time, and then much debate since, including hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars spent distorting what it does and does not do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But all I ask is that you note the population that we\'re talking about and you note the fact that the Affordable Care Act, as written, allows that if you had the insurance on the individual market the President was talking about before passage of the Affordable Care Act and you wanted to keep it, you could keep it.\xc2\xa0 What we obviously cannot do or could not do in the interim was prevent insurers from canceling that policy and then offering a new one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So the good news is that that market is now going to be much more stable, much more secure, much more competitive, and will provide for everyone in it far better minimum services and benefits.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Peter, and then I apologize to those -- and I will get to you, in the back.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Yes.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow in Boston, at Faneuil Hall, the same location where several years ago the commonwealth care law was signed by Governor Mitt Romney, the President is going to speak and make remarks about, among other things, the bipartisan nature of that law.\xc2\xa0 Is Governor Mitt Romney invited to the event tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Has he been invited?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided about that event.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is certainly the case that the health care reform law, health insurance reform law that Governor Romney -- then-Governor Romney signed -- helped bring about and signed into law -- provides a useful model in its implementation for what we\xe2\x80\x99re now seeing as the Affordable Care Act is implemented, or this portion of it is implemented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And as I noted yesterday, in the first month of enrollment in Massachusetts -- and I hope I get these figures right -- I think only 123 people in Massachusetts enrolled in premium-paying insurance plans, a very low number even in a state like Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 So what that tells us is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying even prior to the launch date of October 1st, is that we have an extended enrollment period of six months for a reason, because this is a new marketplace that exists for people and, understandably, they need to take time to shop and become aware of the options available to them; and that, as has been the case in Massachusetts and in other similar kinds of programs, when you have this sort of extended shopping period, most people tend to wait until closer to the deadline before they actually enroll.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that to be the case, and we expected that to be the case with the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to healthcare.gov, issues that have been raised about whether personal data is being protected under the Privacy Act and how secure it is, what assurances can you give Americans that the information they provide through that forum is safe?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that security is a very important issue.\xc2\xa0 I would point to the testimony of Marilyn Tavenner today up on the Hill, the head of CMS, who I think was asked a number of questions about this and, again, citing what she said, and she\xe2\x80\x99s much closer to the ground on these issues -- that as implemented, the website has met security standards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly examining the Affordable Care Act, which has had a launch that has not met the standards of the President or the Secretary, or Marilyn Tavenner, and we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in efforts to make improvements to the Affordable Care Act website -- healthcare.gov -- every day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear from Kathleen Sebelius for the first time before a congressional committee.\xc2\xa0 Just want to get a sense of exactly what -- how frequently they are speaking. Is the President being updated by the HHS Secretary on a daily basis about where things stand right now?\xc2\xa0 And do his expectations remain the same for the number of people to enroll by the March 31st deadline?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is regularly updated on implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in frequent conversation with Secretary Sebelius, as well as others involved in this effort.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing the effort of getting information out to the American people who are interested in this market, and their interest has been demonstrated by the huge numbers who have visited the website and who are visiting the call-in centers and the in-place centers -- in-person centers.\xc2\xa0 And we are very focused on making sure that we enroll as many people as we can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">As I noted, stipulating that there has been unacceptable difficulty in the healthcare.gov site in the early stages here and that those problems are being addressed on a daily basis, we always expected that there would be greater numbers enrolling towards the end of the enrollment period or towards the end of some of these deadline periods than you would see in the early parts.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly expect that to be the case -- it would have been the case regardless.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is very quick.\xc2\xa0 Marilyn Tavenner apologized, a \xe2\x80\x9cmea culpa\xe2\x80\x9d before the congressional members.\xc2\xa0 Does the President expect Kathleen Sebelius should make an apology tomorrow for the flaws that have existed to this point?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President expects Secretary Sebelius to answer the questions asked of her and to provide information about the Affordable Care Act and its implementation to Congress, as she has in the past.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview her remarks beyond that.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Yes, John.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has, according to a report, ordered a curtailing of the eavesdropping at the U.N. Headquarters.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that report?\xc2\xa0 And if not, if the answer is, no, that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, or if you can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm the report or talk about it, why should any other country feel that they can engage in diplomatic good-faith negotiations at the U.N. Headquarters?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that, as I said in response to other questions of this nature, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t respond to specific reports of specific activities -- intelligence-gathering activities.\xc2\xa0 I can say that we are undertaking a review of those activities around the world with a special emphasis on examining whether we have the appropriate posture -- I\xe2\x80\x99m having trouble with that, a lot of p\xe2\x80\x99s -- examining whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state, how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners, and what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So I would include the question that you asked as sort of part of that general area of emphasis.\xc2\xa0 But what I can\xe2\x80\x99t do is say, yes, this is right, and, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, because the nature of this conversation and the kind of activities that we are asked to publicly confirm or deny by definition have national security implications.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should other countries be willing to talk to each other in New York at U.N. Headquarters?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have extremely important relationships obviously with countries around the world, including member countries of the United Nations, and we have a very important and solid relationship with the United Nations institution, beginning with the Secretary General.\xc2\xa0 And, absolutely, we will continue to engage in those -- strengthening those relationships and working with the United Nations and our allies and partners on the host of issues that confront the United States and the world.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, looking back on it as you think about what the White House was saying over the past few months in preparation for the rollout of the website, is there any feeling in the White House that perhaps you set the expectations too high for the website, making the assurances about the cancellations for example, as over the course of the summer?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think on the issue of letters going out to the people in that 5 percent category, that is one question.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to -- because, again, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about those issues, the Affordable Care Act, as written, provides a grandfathering exemption for -- an exemption for those people who had plans that they liked and stayed on those plans and want to keep them for however long they want to keep them, even though they might have better and cheaper alternatives available to them.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing.\xc2\xa0 And that was part of the law itself and the passage of the law and the discussion at the time.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that when it comes to the website, that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, that we expected it to perform better.\xc2\xa0 And nobody is more frustrated by the difficulties the website has encountered than the President, followed I think closely by Secretary Sebelius and Marilyn Tavenner.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have made sure that the teams in place there that are working on this issue have been augmented by a so-called tech surge, a number of individuals who add brainpower and eyes and experience to fixing these challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And you heard from Jeff Zeints the other day, the site is fixable and these teams are going, one-by-one, to isolate the problems that have been identified and fixing them.\xc2\xa0 And every day, we expect the consumer experience to incrementally improve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Contextually, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that even from day one, individuals were getting onto the website; even from day one, individuals have been able to get information through other means -- by phone, mail or in person -- and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve augmented those pathways as well.\xc2\xa0 And every day since we began to tackle these problems, the experience that consumers have had has improved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking in hindsight -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s another way of saying, did we anticipate these problems?\xc2\xa0 And the answer, to the degree that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them, the answer is, no.\xc2\xa0 And I think you know from the way that we talked about this in the run-up to October 1st, that we expected more and better performance from the website.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I just wondered if -- I mean, for example, if the expectation had been, hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to shop for insurance, it takes you hours and hours to do it, we\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to get it down to an hour on the website, or a couple of hours -- instead of saying Kayak -- I mean, that sort of makes people think they can do it in five minutes, right?\xc2\xa0 So my question is could you --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never purchased a ticket in five minutes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just me.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you could have prepared people a little bit for the possibility that this would be a little more onerous of a process?</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we are always welcome to advice on communications.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not offering you advice.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you --</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How much time do I have -- is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?\xc2\xa0 So no, look, I take your point, Christie, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good one.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, too, that the purpose here wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to do anything beyond encourage people to make themselves aware of the options available to them.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the website has had the troubles it\xe2\x80\x99s had makes that a greater challenge.\xc2\xa0 Oddly, some data has shown that all the coverage about it has actually increased interest in Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act, made people more aware of the affordable options available to them.\xc2\xa0 So I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s not the desired way to make that happen, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But the answer I think I can give is just that however we got here, the purpose has always been to get to the finish line. The finish line is functioning marketplaces that provide insurance options for millions of Americans that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have before, so that they have the security that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have before, and so that we can continue the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in restraining the growth in health care costs that have been such a negative driver, like a drag on our businesses, a drag on our economy, a drag on our federal Treasury.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of progress in that regard, at the macro level.\xc2\xa0 And this is a piece of that puzzle, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a piece that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to trim the edges to make sure it fits, because it has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to fit.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen is that millions of Americans -- whether they had to spend hours on the website, or they came in later and had a smooth, shorter experience, or they got their insurance through the call-in centers, or the in-person centers</p>\n<p class="p2">-- are going to find that they have the kind of security that quality health insurance provides that they did not have before. And that is the goal.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just understand one other thing.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this goes to the question of whether it was over-simplified a little bit in advance.\xc2\xa0 As recently as March, the President said a very simple statement using the present tense -- the present tense:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like the plan that you have, you can keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like the plan you had in 2009\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, and I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0 And I can simply say that that was consistent with what the President had been saying since prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And it described -- he was describing what was written into the law, which is that we would -- the law would grandfather in those who had insurance and liked it and wanted to keep it, even once the Affordable Care Act was implemented.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand that there is more to that story because of choices that insurance companies made to change the plans that individuals might have had, and that individuals who purchased a plan for the first time this year because maybe before their employer provided it, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed jobs, and now they don\'t have, that while their insurer knew, and they may have known that the Affordable Care Act was coming into place and that there would be minimum standards, some of them are learning that they are going to get new options available for the first time now.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And part of our job is to get that information out to them so that those individuals who are hearing this from their insurance companies understand that those same insurance companies now have plans that almost universally are better than the ones they had, in terms of the coverage, and that there\xe2\x80\x99s now competition that didn\'t exist before in almost all cases, and they have the ability of receiving generous tax credits if they qualify.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a communications issue.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also why I have tried to gently implore all of you and everyone else who covers these issues to -- when you write about them or broadcast them -- to provide that context so that when you -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re watching on TV this morning, or last night, and you see a report on a network that suggests that 70-something percent or 64 percent of the population is getting cancellation notices because it didn\'t mention that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- even if those figures were true -- a much, much, much smaller portion of the population that --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many people are in the 5 percent?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\'s the size of the American population now. So I think if their point, Ann, is to make the point that Ann made, which --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not 5 percent of insurance holders, it\xe2\x80\x99s 5 percent of --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, 5 percent of the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of the entire country.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And remember, 80 percent of the American people have insurance coverage today either through their employer -- like most of you -- through Medicare, through Medicaid, through the VA.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s 80 percent of the population.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen percent of the population -- and this is a challenge and a problem that has been the focus of some of the efforts to reform our health care system -- have no insurance at all.\xc2\xa0 They depend on the emergency room and they essentially depend on all of us to subsidize their health care, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t even get the kind of preventive services that would obviously make the cost of their health care much lower.</p>\n<p class="p3">That other 5 percent purchases insurance on the inadequate existing individual insurance market.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you can provide a number, because the numbers are out there -- from industry and -- all over the place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would consult Wikipedia for the size of the population and do 5 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I do feel -- I know everybody\'s got to go.\xc2\xa0 I do feel badly.\xc2\xa0 Ari, and then Mark, Cheryl.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you said earlier you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the Wall Street Journal report.\xc2\xa0 NSA Director Alexander just testified on the Hill that the tens of millions of phone records were not collected by NSA, that these records include data collected by NATO allies.\xc2\xa0 Given that Director Alexander testified under oath to this effect a few minutes ago, can you respond to that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would respond by pointing you to the testimony of General Alexander.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 In that case, let me just ask -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned many times this review of intelligence procedures, and the thing I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is you say the review has reached conclusions.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, there\'s --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some conclusions.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 En train, yes.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some of those conclusions have been implemented, and in two months we\'ll learn what those implementations and conclusions were.\xc2\xa0 What do you want us to infer from that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I guess I -- look, it\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 I understand that by indicating that this is not static, that some -- even as we conduct this review, some changes in our practices are being implemented -- that that begs the question, okay, what are they, and I understand that because of the constraints on us in terms of talking about the security -- national security intelligence collection activities, that that is unsatisfying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But I think the point I\'m trying to make is that this is not static; that it is not simply the appointment of a blue ribbon commission that goes off and does a little study in a conference room somewhere and comes back; that this is an active review that has led to some changes in the way that we conduct our intelligence-gathering activities already, but that will, upon conclusion, result in us being able to make public some of the review and some of the changes that we\'ve been able to make, mindful of the fact that we\'re talking about very sensitive issues.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not trying to, with a wink and a nod, tell us today that spying is being curtailed even as you\'re not able to actually tell us that spying is being curtailed?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wink and nod.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wink and nod.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m simply trying to make clear that this is not a static process, and that the changes that have been identified that those who make these decisions believe can be made and should be made, even as the review is being undertaken, are being made.</p>\n<p class="p3">Carol.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that, is there a frustration about these leaks?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 We have stipulated -- well, not stipulated -- I don\'t why I\'m locked on that word earlier in our conversations.\xc2\xa0 But it is absolutely the case that unauthorized leaks of classified information of the kind that we\'ve seen have caused significant damage.\xc2\xa0 And that has been testified to by principals in our national security community, as well as of course by the President.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the answer to that is, yes.\xc2\xa0 What these disclosures -- some of these disclosures have also caused is concern and consternation among some of our allies.\xc2\xa0 And we understand that, and we are addressing these issues through diplomatic channels and through direct --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking specifically about the review.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 About the review?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Things like -- that Ari just asked you about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Leaks about the review?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like that these different things that are trickling out that --</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought you were referring to the general disclosures that have occurred.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure it will come, because it always does, despite the alleged chilling effect.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure there will be leaks of the review, but I\'m not aware of anything specific.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the General Assembly today, nearly every nation on the planet voted to condemn for the 22nd year the U.S. embargo of Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Does that carry any weight in the Oval Office?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I think that the President believes, as so many Americans believe, that Cuba\'s --the Cuban people\'s future would be better served by a system that was more democratic and more open to the world, and we have had a longstanding policy in regard to that.\xc2\xa0 So I think in terms of U.S. policy, we pursue that policy because we think it\'s right.\xc2\xa0 And we are of course mindful of the views of other nations.\xc2\xa0 But there is no question in our mind that there is a brighter future potentially available to the Cuban people with greater freedom, greater democracy, and a freer economy.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence the embargo is working?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are excellent questions that I think, at the end of a long briefing about the Affordable Care Act and NSA disclosures, might be better addressed at the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not HHS?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe you could try HHS.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Everybody is allowed to leave if they want to leave, but I do feel that there was -- Cheryl, I promised you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, real quick.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bludgeon you with accessibility here.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, on the debt limit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate is going to be debating and voting today on the debt limit process.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House changed its mind at all about how that should go forward?\xc2\xa0 Do you support repeal of the debt limit statute -- the resolution, the disapproval process?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are glad that the Congress, and Republicans in Congress who chose to shut the government down and engage in brinksmanship around the debt limit, chose a different path too late, as it turns out, when it comes to the damage that had already been inflicted on the economy and the American people -- damage that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing again today in the consumer confidence numbers.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re glad that this was resolved in a way that will ensure the United States will maintain its status of always paying its bills on time, and that the full faith and credit of the United States will be retained.\xc2\xa0 Our position is what it has always been, which is the authority to deal with the debt ceiling resides with Congress.\xc2\xa0 So we look to Congress to exercise that authority in a responsible way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put the world on edge and the global economy on edge every time that the issue comes up.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it need to be changed?\xc2\xa0 Does the process need to be changed?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, our view is the same, Cheryl, as it was when we were in the thick of it, if you will, which is that it is up to Congress to decide how it wants to exercise that authority.\xc2\xa0 To say that it would be better if a future President could deal with this through executive action would be sort of beside the point, because no President, not this one or any future President, as the laws are currently written, has that authority.\xc2\xa0 So Congress would have to decide how to deal with this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Our view is that whatever they decide, they ought to deal with it in a manner that does not send a signal to the world that we may not pay our bills and that we may flirt with default.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Olivier and then you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to get back to the NSA review you\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed throughout this briefing, and I wanted to get at two of the criteria.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned heads of state and you mentioned closest allies and partners.\xc2\xa0 Does that review include people who are below the head of state level?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cover a lot of prime ministers.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said, Olivier, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a special emphasis on those areas, and then I also said that the review itself would be broader in many ways.\xc2\xa0 So without -- we could -- you could reduce this to questions about whether we engaged in intelligence gathering at all or whether we should.\xc2\xa0 And the answer is we do and we should, and we will, just as other nations do and should and will because it\xe2\x80\x99s in their national security interests.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to stipulate that.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, specificity about what kind of activities we engage in I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to put off until we finish this review and have more to offer you about the changes that are made.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that suggests to me that you then can\'t also define who the closest allies and partners are, is that right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not in this context, no.\xc2\xa0 I think that the -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to provide greater specificity about alleged or reported intelligence-gathering activities except to say that this review is underway, that the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to find that balance that allows us to take the necessary actions under the law to gather intelligence that enhances our national security and enhances the security of our allies and friends, and that also is mindful of the security -- rather, the privacy concerns of Americans and others.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to understand the eavesdropping on Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone.\xc2\xa0 All that we hear is that the (inaudible) -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a practice in general, as a matter of security and saving lives here and abroad and so on with the allies, your allies.\xc2\xa0 But can you explain to the German audience which kind of danger occurs from Chancellor Merkel?\xc2\xa0 Is she in the broader sense a terror suspect or what?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is what I said last week and again this week, which is that the President spoke with Chancellor Merkel about these issues as well as other issues.\xc2\xa0 He assured her that the United States does not and will not collect information on her communications on her cell phone, for example.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to reports about specific activity or alleged activity that the United States may or may not have engaged in, when it comes to gathering intelligence, I just can\'t comment.\xc2\xa0 The broader issue of heads of state and allies and partners and friends is receiving special emphasis in the review that the President initiated.\xc2\xa0 And when that review concludes at the end of the year, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more detail to provide to you.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President staying in Boston for the game?</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
