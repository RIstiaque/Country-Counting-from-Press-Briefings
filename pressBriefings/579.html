Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:00 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for giving my deputy the opportunity for brief for an hour and seven minutes yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to top that today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to just go and go and go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I left my coffee back there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We should have one of those Nespresso --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nespresso machines.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those are excellent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s a Keurig back there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that kind of thing when I worked back there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Nespresso machine that nobody knows how to work it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I could use one.\xc2\xa0 Still recovering from the extraordinary trip to South Africa and the many hours in the air.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBefore I take your questions, I will deliver to you a topper, and that is to note that today, as you can see here, we are highlighting how the Affordable Care Act is providing new protections for the up to 17 million children across the country who can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because of the health care law, insurance companies have been prohibited from denying health coverage to children with preexisting conditions since 2010.\xc2\xa0 And starting in 2014, insurance companies will also no longer be able to charge higher premiums based on health status or history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These protections are especially important for Americans like Lisa Prandy, whose daughter Zoe was diagnosed with childhood kidney cancer at age three.\xc2\xa0 Because of the health care law, insurance companies are now prohibited from denying health coverage to children like Zoe who have preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 This not only gives parents peace of mind, it helps ensure that families can focus on helping kids get better instead of worrying whether their insurance company will deny coverage due to preexisting conditions for needed and often lifesaving treatments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, if opponents of reform had their way and repealed the law, these protections for children with preexisting conditions would be stripped away, meaning that up to 17 million kids could once again be at risk of being denied health insurance coverage for conditions such as asthma, cancer or diabetes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I will now take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A budget issue, unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 Today, Senator Reid said that that issue probably will come to the -- or he\'ll try to bring that to the floor in January and make it retroactive so 1.3 million unemployed workers don\xe2\x80\x99t lose their benefits.\xc2\xa0 Is that a plan that the White House supports?\xc2\xa0 And isn\'t it much more difficult to pass something like that without an underlying bill that would help carry it through?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 We have been very clear that we strongly support the idea that Congress should extend unemployment insurance benefits to the 1.3 million Americans who will lose those benefits three days after Christmas if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act.\xc2\xa0 If it was the right thing to do when President George W. Bush did it, extended unemployment insurance benefits at a time when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, and at a time when the average unemployed person was unemployed for 17 weeks, then it\'s the right thing to do today, as it has been over the past several years since the Great Recession occurred.</p>\n<p>Even though the unemployment rate has been coming down, even though more Americans are going back to work, there are still too many Americans out of work and struggling to find work.\xc2\xa0 The unemployment rate is 7 percent.\xc2\xa0 It\'s come down significantly, but it is still much too high.\xc2\xa0 And in our view, Congress should take the necessary action to provide the extension of benefits at this incredibly important time so that those Americans can continue the effort of trying to find work without wondering whether or not they can feed their families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we continue to call on Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 This is something that, in the past, because it\xe2\x80\x99s emergency aid and it is aid that is phased down as the employment situation improves, therefore it\xe2\x80\x99s not unlimited, has in the past most often been addressed in a way without offsets that could be and should be today addressed in that way.</p>\n<p>That remains our position.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the House is leaving tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that they go on recess for the holiday tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress does not act in time before those benefits expire, we would absolutely expect them to act as soon as possible upon their return.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s so important, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House insist that this be part of the budget agreement and even threaten perhaps a veto if it did not include it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We strongly support the budget agreement.\xc2\xa0 You saw the statement that we put out from the President, and heard what Josh and others have said about it.\xc2\xa0 We think it is a small but important step in what we hope is a return to regular order, where the economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t threatened by the obstacles thrown up in its way here in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There was an interesting quote today I noted, I think from S&amp;P that referred to the budget agreement as, \xe2\x80\x9ca very positive development.\xc2\xa0 You could see the federal government go from being a drag to being a net positive if this goes through, which is hard to believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty unimpressive bar for Washington to clear, but it reflects that for too long now -- in shutting down the government, in refusing to compromise -- Washington has actually caused problems for the economy, when at the very least it should be neutral, and at its best, which is what the President believes it ought to do, Washington should be taking action that helps the economy grow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what we see in this, again, modest but significant budget deal -- significant in what it represents -- we see the opportunity for mitigation of or buying back of a significant portion of the arbitrary cuts represented by sequester.\xc2\xa0 We see continued modest deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We see necessary investments in areas like scientific research that can produce discoveries and innovation that, in turn, produce new businesses and jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be.\xc2\xa0 And most importantly, perhaps psychologically, it tells the American people that at least for the next couple of years, if Congress passes it, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about Republicans deciding to shut down the government again over their ideological disagreements with the President.<br/>\n\tAgain, not a high hurdle, but clearing it is important for our economy, and we support that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also support strongly the extension of unemployment insurance for the reasons I just mentioned -- because these families deserve it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, think about it.\xc2\xa0 Standard unemployment insurance benefits last for 26 weeks.\xc2\xa0 Today, even after all the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in growth and job creation in the wake of the Great Recession, the average unemployed person is unemployed for 36 weeks -- the average unemployed person.\xc2\xa0 This is a persistent problem that needs to be addressed, and Washington ought to make sure that these families receive -- continue to receive the benefits that they need now, as we make the necessary policy here in Washington that helps our economy grow instead of doing what has happened in the past -- the government was shut down and making it -- reducing growth and reducing job creation.</p>\n<p>So the combination of a budget deal and passage of this extension of unemployment insurance would have significant positive effects on our economy as well as these individual families.\xc2\xa0 So we call on Congress to do that as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject that we asked about yesterday, but there have been some developments -- this issue of the sign language interpreter in South Africa.\xc2\xa0 We now find out that apparently he\xe2\x80\x99s had psychotic episodes in the past and that he told one of our reporters that he was afraid of becoming violent while he was doing the sign language interpretation.\xc2\xa0 Was there<br/>\n\t-- is there now a concern, a security concern regarding that episode?\xc2\xa0 Has the White House spoken to the South African government about the interpreter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For matters regarding the President\xe2\x80\x99s security I would refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 And obviously they worked very hard on this trip, which came about on short notice. But they, as they always do, took the precautions necessary to ensure the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, for specifics related to this individual, I would either refer you to the government of South Africa or to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a follow-up on the budget.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House try harder to get the UI extension into this budget bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I just said to Jim, we strongly support --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you do, but why didn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and let me say that we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it has to be attached to anything.\xc2\xa0 We believe Congress could act, as it has often -- under President Reagan, under President George W. Bush, under President Obama in the first four years in the wake of the Great Recession -- to extend unemployment insurance because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do and because it helps our economy as well as helps these families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re for it.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering strategically, you have to have some kind of a strategy to get it done, and just talking about it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be achieving that.\xc2\xa0 So what leverage do you have going forward, I guess, since it\xe2\x80\x99s not in this particular bill?\xc2\xa0 How do you expect, and what will the strategy be to get this passed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will continue to work with Congress and press upon Congress our view that these benefits be extended for the reasons I just mentioned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is absolutely the case, as I told Jim, that we support the budget agreement and we believe it needs to be passed because of the good that will do to the economy and for the American middle class, and the certainty it will create for once, or for once in a long while, for the economy and for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We want them both, and we think Congress ought to pass them both. And we commend those who crafted the budget deal on the work they did, and we call on the House and the Senate to pass it.</p>\n<p>We also strongly support passage of an extension of the unemployment insurance benefits that -- again, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a quid pro quo, when you talk about the essential need that these families have and the benefit that ensuring that unemployment insurance is extended to the economy.\xc2\xa0 That was certainly why many Republicans, including Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell and the Majority Leader, Eric Cantor in the House, have supported extension of unemployment insurance benefits in the past.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why -- again, our view is if it was the right thing to do when the unemployment rate was lower and when the average person was unemployed for fewer weeks, it certainly has to be the right thing to do now.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to press forward on this and work with Congress so that they get it done as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just give a flavor at all about how strategically you plan to do that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to press very aggressively to get it done.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lay out a legislative strategy for you, again, because we see it as a fairly cut-and-dry proposition where it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for these families, it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It has, for the vast majority of occasions when it\xe2\x80\x99s been brought up in past, been done so as emergency assistance without offsets.\xc2\xa0 We certainly think that is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s our position, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with Congress to press forward on it.\xc2\xa0 And this is, again, something that has been supported in the past not just by Democrats, but by Republicans, for all the reasons I just mentioned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one separate topic.\xc2\xa0 Is the President close to naming a number two at the Federal Reserve and is that going to be Stanley Fisher?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no personnel announcements to make or hints to give.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously takes these kinds of decisions seriously, and when he has one to announce he\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Go up and back.\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to the website issue.\xc2\xa0 Has anyone in the White House taken onus themselves to go onsite and watch some of the technology as it\xe2\x80\x99s in play being worked on with the website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jeff Zients, at the request of the President and Secretary Sebelius, has been working on this issue and overseeing the improvements to the website that have delivered the kind of progress that we\'ve been noting these past days and weeks.\xc2\xa0 So the answer is, yes, there\'s a team of people who work on these issues, on the broader implementation of the Affordable Care Act, who work with CMS, work with HHS.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the fixes that you\'re talking about to the website, Jeff Zients has been the point person on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as we\'ve noted -- I noticed a USA Today headline this morning that talked about the fact that the number of people enrolled in November was quadruple -- more than quadruple the number in October, reflecting the numbers that were put out by HHS yesterday.\xc2\xa0 That reflects the progress made through November, and that is obviously even before we met our goal of ensuring that the site was working effectively for the vast majority of users by November 30th.</p>\n<p>So we continue to make progress.\xc2\xa0 They, importantly, continue to make progress, addressing to fix the problems that exist and fixing them.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ve seen in the data that\'s been released that demand for this remains extremely high.\xc2\xa0 And our commitment to ensuring that we meet that demand with an effective means to make the purchase or to enroll remains very high.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what I\'m asking is specifically, is someone from the White House as recently as Saturday gone to a site -- specifically CSSI in Columbia, Maryland -- to look hands-on at what is being done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have everybody\'s travel plans.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there have been a number of people -- I think it\'s QSSI that you\'re talking about, the main contractor -- who have been working on this issue and both onsite and remote 24/7, for all the reasons that we\'ve talked about -- and some of them very unhappy reasons -- that we\'ve talked about since October 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as the conversations go around the White House about the website, has there been a concern that each contract at the beginning was not integrated with the other contract from other companies to bring the whole system together?\xc2\xa0 And also, was there a concern about load balances when -- with the anticipation or those who went on the site, it was likened to me like a crowd going to Wal-Mart on Black Friday with Thanksgiving sales, just going in, straight in, versus one group being sent here, one group being sent there, another group being sent there.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s an excellent analogy, and what we saw in October when the site was functioning so poorly is that there was only one entrance and that entrance was malfunctioning, and that caused all the problems that we\'ve discussed and enumerated from here and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we see now with the improvements to the site is both improved capacity, significantly expanded capacity, but also mechanisms in place so that if there are surges, as we saw on December 2nd -- I think that was the Monday, the first workday after November 30th -- that there is a queuing system set up that functions effectively so that the system isn\'t overloaded, and individuals are placed in a queue, told when to come back,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 emailed and communicated with.\xc2\xa0 And that system has worked very effectively as designed, as I understand it.</p>\n<p>Now, for some of the more technical questions -- and I was impressed by your grasp of the issues -- we have, as you know, regular briefings by CMS that include people who are more steeped in the technical aspects of it.\xc2\xa0 But you hit the nail on the head in describing what some of those early problems were and why there needed to be, if not other doors, places for people to queue so that they have the most effective and efficient experience with the website.</p>\n<p>Now, again, not every issue has been resolved, but there is no question -- and I think this was reflected in both the data that\'s been released and in the anecdotal reporting that we\'ve seen -- that the website has vastly improved, and that a huge increase in the number of Americans enrolling is a welcomed development.\xc2\xa0 We started from a bad place, and I will -- every day that we talk -- anybody asks me about improvements on the website, I will begin and end by saying we created a lot of problems for ourselves and that\'s why it was so important to take responsibility for that and ensure that we put the teams in place necessary to make the fixes necessary to deliver on the promise of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re at about 90 percent operational now on that website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 CMS may have more details for you.\xc2\xa0 I think we talked about -- the metrics we use have to do with error rates and response times and stability of the system.\xc2\xa0 They have put some metrics, additional metrics, on it over at CMS.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have them.\xc2\xa0 But we are -- it is functioning for the vast majority of users effectively, and we continue to make progress on those issues.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To go back to the -- I know you said related to the Secret Service issue -- but can you at least walk us through how the security -- what was the interaction between the President\xe2\x80\x99s security and what was done in advance and the South African government?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that would be something specifically that the Secret Service would address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you do not know if the Secret Service at all had asked for at least the backgrounds of anybody that was going to be on the podium with the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t discuss the measures taken by the Secret Service, even the ones that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, in order --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are aware of this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know some of the general things that are done in preparation for trips like these to ensure the President\xe2\x80\x99s security and the security of others traveling with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a protocol between countries that\'s done between countries?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, before I get even any further down the road in describing what the Secret Service does and how it does it, I will stop and refer you to the Secret Service, except to assure you that when the President travels -- notably, when he travels abroad and especially in a circumstance like that where there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a big venue with a lot of people, the Secret Service works very hard to take the necessary precautions to ensure the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there ever a point that the President himself was concerned?\xc2\xa0 Can you share that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you, having been with him on the entire trip, that I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he was ever concerned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he never was made aware -- were you guys ever made aware of any security concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 I was not aware of any, beyond just the generic concern that there\xe2\x80\x99s always an issue when you travel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Senate Democrats make a mistake by not including UI in the negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our view is that this can and should be done, and I think Senator Reid has said that he will address it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not bringing it up this year.\xc2\xa0 He already said he\xe2\x80\x99s punting until next year.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which means they will expire, period.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s already made that decision.\xc2\xa0 They\'re expiring.\xc2\xa0 We know that for sure.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The House is leaving, right?\xc2\xa0 Without the House -- despite the fact that the House, including Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor and others have supported extension of benefits in the past, including times when those benefits have been extended without offsets, it can\'t get done if the House leaves.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question about that.\xc2\xa0 There is still time for the House to change its mind, and then we would see what would happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>My only point is that we support the budget deal.\xc2\xa0 We want to see it passed.\xc2\xa0 We want to see the House pass it and the Senate pass it.\xc2\xa0 We do not believe that extension of the unemployment insurance benefits has to be attached to something for it to pass, or that if it\xe2\x80\x99s not attached to something, or to this specific bill, that then Congress is absolved of the responsibility of taking action.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 And we hope and expect that Congress will do the right thing by these families, do what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past in circumstances like this by extending benefits, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a specific plan?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to extend it 90 days?\xc2\xa0 Six months?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to like be based on when --Senator Tim Kaine said today he\'d like it based on an actual percentage of whatever the unemployment rate is.\xc2\xa0 Then when it hits that mark, okay, then you revert back to 26 weeks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen that proposal or specific proposals.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s important to understand that the system already works that way, that when the unemployment rate comes down, the number of weeks is reduced.\xc2\xa0 And what has happened in these emergency extensions is that the baseline period of 26 weeks has been extended because of the high level of unemployment and the high level of long-term unemployment.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what a temporary extension would address.\xc2\xa0 But the program works -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics, but that\xe2\x80\x99s how the program works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that, but do you want --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think there has been broad bipartisan support in the past, given current economic conditions and job market conditions, to extending these benefits.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe, despite the improvements in the economy and the improvements in job creation, that Congress will take the actions that it has in the past.</p>\n<p>But on the broader point -- look, we believe they should extend it.\xc2\xa0 We believe they ought to be extended for a year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to extend it for a full year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what we would prefer.\xc2\xa0 Now, we\'re --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d accept 90 days, 180?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to say what we would accept.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to say that we will obviously work with Congress on how to do this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, it\'s a pretty simple proposition.\xc2\xa0 Based on the history here, based on where we are in unemployment and long-term unemployment, there is I think an irrefutable argument that this should be done consistent with actions by Congress in the past.\xc2\xa0 And again, consistent with actions by Congress in the past, we believe that this is something that Congress could do and should do without offsets.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll look at proposals by Congress that may address this in a different way.\xc2\xa0 We believe that benefits ought to be extended.</p>\n<p>Let me -- yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you all think that you\'ll be able to prevent -- or that Congress won\'t vote for more Iran sanctions, for sanctions on Iran?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We continue to make very clear to Congress our view that now is not the time to vote on additional sanctions -- to vote for additional sanctions, because doing so would threaten to divide the P5-plus-1 and to empower Iran\'s hardliners.</p>\n<p>The purpose of sanctions -- and this administration has led the way in building the most comprehensive, effective sanctions regime in history -- wasn\'t just to punish -- or isn\'t just to punish Iran for its behavior, but to compel Iran to come to the negotiating table prepared to change its behavior.\xc2\xa0 And the effectiveness of the sanctions I think have indisputably led to the point where Iran has come to the table and Iran has agreed with a unified P5-plus-1 -- that is a unified position of the United States and our allies on this issue -- the P5 of the United Nations, plus Germany -- to a preliminary agreement that when implemented will halt progress on Iran\'s nuclear program, will roll it back in certain key aspects, and will maintain the sanctions regime, and will provide only modest, reversible relief to Iran in return for its compliance while there is a six-month time period for the P5-plus-1 to explore whether Iran is serious about reaching a permanent diplomatic solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that message is getting through to Congress, to the point where they won\'t vote on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t predict congressional action.\xc2\xa0 That\'s always a risky thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I will say that we are communicating that message as clearly as we can, and I think, importantly, making the point to those who are focused on this issue that this is not about whether you\'re for or against sanctions.\xc2\xa0 This administration has been more aggressively for sanctions than any of its predecessors and in a way that ensured we could create the kind of international consensus behind the view that Iran was the problem than has ever been seen.</p>\n<p>And what we believe is that Congress ought to refrain from passing new sanctions unless and until the passage of new sanctions can be most effective.\xc2\xa0 And that would be the case if Iran failed to comply with its commitments in the preliminary deal or failed to reach a permanent solution, a final solution with the P5-plus-1 after or at any time up to the six-month period that we\'ve been talking about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we have had great partners in Congress in implementing this sanctions regime and we believe that Congress\'s power here is best used at the moment of maximum leverage if that comes to be necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one thing on jobless benefits?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that President Bush extended unemployment insurance without offsets.\xc2\xa0 Did he and President Obama talk about that at all when they were on the plane for 16-17 hours?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot more than that, actually.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to read out the conversations that the President had with former President Bush, some of which I was present for, some of which I was not.\xc2\xa0 I know President Obama greatly enjoyed the opportunity to have President and Laura Bush onboard Air Force One for this unique trip for Nelson Mandela\'s service.\xc2\xa0 And the two men, as well as the former First Lady and the current First Lady spent a lot of time together.\xc2\xa0 And I know that President Obama and the First Lady greatly enjoyed that experience and appreciated the time with the Bushes. But I don\'t have any specific readouts of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I think they covered an enormous range of topics, including a lot of topics not related to policy or politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it is true, separate from that experience, that President Bush, President Reagan did support extension of unemployment insurance when the economy called for it, and President Obama does as well.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the website, following on April, given the fact that you say every time you asked about this, you\'re going to acknowledge there were mistakes made on October 1st.\xc2\xa0 What\'s being done differently?\xc2\xa0 What is that plan to make sure that on January 1st not only is the website working, which appears it\'s working better now, but there are still questions -- even Secretary Sebelius acknowledged yesterday at the hearing that some of the backend systems are still not ready and there are people out there concerned that even if they have their paperwork in on December 23rd, even if they\'ve sent a check in, are they really covered on January 1st?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the game plan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that there is no higher priority for CMS than making sure that every 834 form -- and I apologize to anybody watching who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is, but that is the form that goes to the question that you ask -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the information that\xe2\x80\x99s provided as part of the enrollment process to the insurance company that an enrollee chose.\xc2\xa0 And making sure that those forms are accurate is CMS\xe2\x80\x99s highest priority, and making sure that those forms are accurate, both present-day ones, people who are filling out today, but going all the way to October 1st, are accurate is the top priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So CMS is working with issuers to validate the information on those forms and to validate what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in terms of the recent fixes made and, most importantly, to ensure that anyone seeking coverage will know that their enrollment is confirmed and they will be able to access care.</p>\n<p>So I think we talked about before that it\xe2\x80\x99s a positive of an unfortunate situation that because there were the problems with the website that we saw on so many aspects of it in October, that the number of enrollees in October are smaller than we hoped but that that universe is not particularly large when the biggest number of problems occurred on the website, including on the backend.\xc2\xa0 So the universe is one that CMS is able to address and to take action to ensure that everyone who is enrolled and filled out one of those 834 forms has the accurate information that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.</p>\n<p>Secondarily, CMS is taking action to reach out to everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s enrolled to make sure that they are communicating with their insurers, so that they follow through in a way that if they enrolled in order to get insurance on January 1st, they\xe2\x80\x99re taking all the steps necessary, including knowing when their first payment is due so that that insurance kicks in on time.</p>\n<p>And again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no higher priority, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you mentioned CMS.\xc2\xa0 My question is also -- CMS was taking the lead with the contractors on October 1st and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the job done by the President\xe2\x80\x99s own admission.\xc2\xa0 How hands-on is the White House?\xc2\xa0 How can you reassure the American people that -- you immediately said CMS is doing this, this, and this.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But is the White House hands-on this time with a game play saying, are you checking the box, are you doing this, are you doing that?\xc2\xa0 Are you on top of it this time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is, yes, because a lot of has changed in the way this operation is working over at CMS.\xc2\xa0 A team of experts was brought in to address the problems with the website.\xc2\xa0 Jeff Zients was placed in a position of managing that effort.\xc2\xa0 And I think results have been fairly evident.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet; we are still engaged in an effort to make continued progress with the functionality of the website and with other aspects of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 But this is still an operation that emanates out of CMS.\xc2\xa0 And Jeff Zients in this capacity has been working for CMS, but he is clearly --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President on top of this personally?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He absolutely is, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just quickly on this and then one other topic.\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan B?\xc2\xa0 You thought it was going to work on October 1st; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 You have tried to fix it; there are gains being made.\xc2\xa0 What is the plan B that if somebody does sign up -- and you say all these checks are being made -- but on January 1st somebody, God forbid, is in a car accident, something happens, they go to the hospital.\xc2\xa0 What is the plan B to make sure that somebody really has insurance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking every step to ensure that this highest priority is acted on, that everyone who has enrolled is being reached out to and that all of the 834 forms are accurate, both past and present.</p>\n<p>I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate, because we believe this issue is being addressed.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no higher priority.\xc2\xa0 And especially between now and December 23rd, which is when you need to enroll by in order to have insurance on January 1st, an enormous amount of effort is being expended on this particular issue to ensure that those who have enrolled are in a situation where all the steps have been taken care of so that they get their insurance on January 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one on access around here.\xc2\xa0 You saw probably this New York Times op-ed today by the head of AP photo.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s charging at the President, and his words is \xe2\x80\x9cundemocratic, hypocritical\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to transparency and openness around here because of photographers not having the same access as the official White House photographer here.\xc2\xa0 Specifically I want you to react to that, but more importantly, substantively, dozens of media organizations wrote to you about this recently.\xc2\xa0 What substantive steps are being taken beyond the back-and-forth on this?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s being done to actually improve that access?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for that question, and let me tell you at the start here that from the President on down, everyone here believes strongly in the absolute necessity of a free and independent press to cover the presidency, to cover the government, to cover Washington.\xc2\xa0 I personally, as someone who was a reporter for 21 years, have a great deal of passion about this issue and believe strongly in the necessity of a free and independent press to cover the White House, the government, Washington.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to photographers, I have enormous regard, and so does the President, for the work that they do, for the power of their images and what they can convey.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In my career as a reporter, before I got to Washington, I spent some time overseas and occasionally was in dangerous places, and what I always thought was amazing was that every reporter in those situations puts himself or herself at risk, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re a print reporter or a TV reporter and there are bombs or bullets, you duck.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re a cameraman or a photographer, you stand up.\xc2\xa0 And I have huge admiration for that service to the free flow of information and the unbelievable bravery that cameramen and photographers display, especially overseas in hard areas, in dangerous areas, like Afghanistan, like Syria and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>I can commit to you that we are working and have been working on expanding access where we can.\xc2\xa0 Now, the tension between White Houses and White House press corps over access is longstanding, and I think you and I and others have discussed that.\xc2\xa0 I remember having debates about these issues when I was sitting in your seat -- or the seat behind you -- and know that this has been an ongoing discussion.\xc2\xa0 And nevertheless, I believe strongly -- I know Josh does, everybody here -- that we need to listen to those concerns and act on them where we can.</p>\n<p>It is always going to be the case, as it has since there have been photographers in the White House, that White House photographers take pictures and White Houses release them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 There are new technological developments -- the Internet -- that make the way that these images are disseminated different from how it was done in the past when they used to develop film in the basement here and hand it out in the Briefing Room.\xc2\xa0 But the fundamental here hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really changed, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with everyone here, with the photographers and with the White House Correspondents Association, to address this as much as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one, I promise.\xc2\xa0 But at the Mandela memorial service, the official White House photographer was up on the platform with the President -- the current President, two former Presidents.\xc2\xa0 You were asked earlier about the possibility of there could have, God forbid, been a terrible incident with this interpreter potential security issue.\xc2\xa0 The official White House photographer was up there and individual photographers from news organizations that you just hailed were not allowed on that same platform.\xc2\xa0 That was just a couple days ago.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things, Ed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think there were photographers there, and I think if you ask the photographers on the trip, we made --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were in other areas of the stadium --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We made -- I think our staff went to great lengths to get as much access for all of our traveling press as we could, in fact, got exceptionally more access for our traveling press than we were told we would get.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you ask the people who traveled, they would confirm that.\xc2\xa0 That includes photographers and print reporters and TV reporters.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s something when we go overseas we work with all the time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the disposition of the photographers when it comes to the way the President is standing or sitting is obviously something that is worked out depending on the host government and what we can do in working with the photographers.\xc2\xa0 But this is something, I promise you, Ed, we take seriously and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work hard on addressing in ways that we hope will be responsive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that, please?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a specific question about that trip just to get a sense of how you -- how this White House approaches this.\xc2\xa0 The flight on Air Force One, which was what, 20 hours over and 20 hours back, with two Presidents on board, a historic event.\xc2\xa0 Was there any consideration given to allowing the White House photographers that were there as part of the pool on Air Force One to come up to get a photograph of the two Presidents?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a 40-hour flight.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was plenty of time to do something like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they were on the plane.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was requested.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they asked.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 But remember that we\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was okay for Pete Souza to take those pictures, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it always been okay for a White House photographer to take pictures?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In all the hours that you spoke of, Jay, there was not possible for one second to arrange for --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I take your point.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the pool to take their pictures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- for a lot of those hours, the President, the former President, the First Lady and the former First Lady were asleep.\xc2\xa0 So we probably weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to bring in a still pool for that.\xc2\xa0 Or they were having dinner or something like that.\xc2\xa0 But look, I think I just made clear that I want to work on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that fair to say that you\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an issue and I --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know it\xe2\x80\x99s one for us.\xc2\xa0 You guys believe -- you believe this is -- needs to be better?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an issue, and I promise you it\xe2\x80\x99s been an issue for as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And I can show you a letter from the White House News Photographers Association to my predecessor in the Bush administration complaining about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you acknowledged from your end that you think it\'s -- you think this has not been --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would acknowledge that, absolutely, we need to -- we\'re going to work with the press and with the photographers to try to address some of their concerns.\xc2\xa0 What I can also assure you is that we will not create a day that has never existed, at least in modern times, when everyone in the White House press corps is satisfied with the amount of access they get to the President.\xc2\xa0 That would be, I think, impossible to expect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, but have you ever given consideration to the flip side, which is to say, you guys say to the press, we\'re not going to let you into an event because we consider it a private event, right -- the conversations between the Presidents, what have you -- and then Pete Souza or whoever takes those photos -- have you ever considered saying to them, you can\'t release those photos because we have said it\'s a private event.\xc2\xa0 Because it surprised all of us when you say it\'s a private event --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We put on the schedule when things are open press or closed press.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we designate them "private."\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that --\xc2\xa0 Mike, I think -- I really think this is an important discussion to have and I think that it\'s important to have it within the context of all the changes that are happening in the media.\xc2\xa0 And here\'s what I know, is that for years, through presidencies of both parties, there have been White House photographers, official White House photographers, who have, by the nature of their jobs, had been in rooms with the President when others aren\'t there and taken pictures and released those photos, often on the same day.\xc2\xa0 And what -- hold on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- distribute them.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, so the issue here is -- I think this is the essence of the conversation, and it\'s not -- it means that -- because I think by that question you\'re acknowledging that we\'re not doing -- we\'re not operating any differently than other White House offices have operated except that the Internet exists and that in the past when White House photos were developed and handed out here, news organizations could decide whether their readers would ever see those photos.</p>\n<p>What exists now on the Internet is the ability for everyone -- every one of you, everyone on the street, everyone around the world to take a picture and put it on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 And the White House posts some pictures on the Internet identified as official White House photographs.\xc2\xa0 So the fundamental difference here is distribution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I can tell you, again, because of the respect I have for the photographers, in particular, that I am very sensitive to the situation therein -- and that all of us -- when I say us, I was in\xc2\xa0 -- by the transformation created by the Internet and the pressure that has put on business models.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what is often never mentioned in op-eds or in other venues where this issue is raised, but a lot of this -- some of this, anyway, has to do with fundamental transformations in the media of which we and other institutions are simply participants, but we did not create the Internet, this administration, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is not an issue on Air Force One --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Guys --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Internet had nothing to do with Air Force One. There was constraints --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, April.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Go ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our problem is access.\xc2\xa0 You can put out a million pictures a day from the White House photographer and you bar --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m saying that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you put out pictures from Air Force One --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m saying, Ann, is that we are going to work with -- as past White Houses have done, and we are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But past White Houses also allowed photos of the front of Air Force One --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, Jon.\xc2\xa0 And so have we.\xc2\xa0 But just not -- you think that -- hey guys, if you\'re telling me that on every flight that President Bush took and every flight that President Clinton took --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but talking about historic flights --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was not any flight, let\'s be honest, with two\xc2\xa0 Presidents on the plane.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Guys, what I\'m saying is we hear you, and I want to address this.\xc2\xa0 And I want to work with the photographers to improve that situation and see if we can be responsive to your concerns.\xc2\xa0 All I\'m noting, in answer to Michael\'s question, is that this is part of a bigger transformation that\'s happening out there that\'s driven by the ability of everyone to post anything on the Internet free of charge so that you don\'t have to buy that newspaper or subscribe to that wire service to see that photograph.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, no, uh-uh.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s true, Ann.\xc2\xa0 It\'s true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Internet had nothing to do --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Internet had nothing -- on Air Force One, we understand there were constraints in Africa on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But the Internet had nothing to do on Air Force One, when you had a large group of reporters in the pool -- photographers there, as well -- who could have come up with Pete Souza to the front of Air Force One and taken a couple of pictures.\xc2\xa0 Maybe not as maybe Pete Souza did, but we were not allowed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you can post as many as you want.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but you could have allowed us the availability.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hear you, April.\xc2\xa0 I hear you, and I\'m saying that those are the kind of issues --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Internet had nothing to do with that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- we\'re going to address, and I want to work with the Correspondents Association and the photographers to see if we can be responsive in a way that allows them more of the access that they seek and obviously allows us to operate the way every other White House has operated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you hear the clicks from these cameras when you started talking about this?\xc2\xa0 They were letting you know that they\'re here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Did you hear that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I always know they\'re here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, but, I mean, seriously, did you hear their clicks while they were taking pictures of you, while you were speaking about this issue?\xc2\xa0 Did you hear them?\xc2\xa0 That was their form of saying, we are here.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get that, April.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Brianna.\xc2\xa0 Brianna, let\'s give Brianna a chance.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say it\'s an issue of distribution being different. But isn\'t it also the difference of the standard that this administration has set for itself?\xc2\xa0 You say past White Houses have done things similarly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, anyone here can tell that there\'s less access than under the Bush administration, and yet it was President Obama who said --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did you cover Bush?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did.\xc2\xa0 I did at times.\xc2\xa0 And it was President Obama who talked about transparency being a hallmark of his administration. So isn\'t it sort of the problem is that he has set up a standard himself that he\'s not meeting, that his White House is not meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Brianna, is every White House, every President has had meetings that the press didn\'t cover.\xc2\xa0 Every White House has released photographs of, if they had children, of Presidents and First Ladies with their children that obviously the press didn\'t cover.\xc2\xa0 But I understand that also the press corps has always sought and sometimes demanded more access.\xc2\xa0 And I want to work with and we want to work with the photographers and others to see how we can be more responsive, understanding that I will not live to see the day, and neither will you, when independent journalists who cover the White House will say, you know what, I got all the access I wanted today or this week or next month.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what we\'re asking for.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that is -- there\'s the issue of access -- I think that\'s what you just identified -- versus distribution.\xc2\xa0 So there are two things here.\xc2\xa0 And what we can address is access.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that in a lot of the conversations I had with photographers, it\'s also come down to distribution and what they view as competition, because those photographers become available and create competition to them because of the way -- the modern ways that these things can be distributed, not through news organizations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\'m sympathetic to that, and I understand it, and I understand the downward pressure that the Internet creates on media organizations, all of the ones represented here, by and large.\xc2\xa0 But on the access issue, that\'s something we can address and we\'re going to try to address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say that you\'re going to work to address that, so does that mean that you will allow photographers into --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And reporters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and reporters --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to try to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and editorial -- producers and reporters into events that you\'re not -- I mean, you\'re saying you\'re working with them.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 Are you actually doing something, or are you just talking about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that we are going to -- we have been meeting with representatives of the White House Correspondents, and we will continue to work to increase access, to be responsive to some of these concerns.\xc2\xa0 But I can promise you that the outcome of that will not be complete satisfaction, because there are going to be occasions, as there have been with every President, that the press is not present in a meeting or a situation involving the President, where there are existing photographs because the White House photographer took them.\xc2\xa0 And some of those are national security related.\xc2\xa0 Some of those --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to -- concrete examples of turning the dial towards more openness?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there will be --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are going to work on getting more access.\xc2\xa0 But I can, again, promise that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that mean, "we\'re going to work on"?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to give the access?\xc2\xa0 What does it mean "working on giving" --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that we\'re going to work on finding ways to be responsive and provide more access.\xc2\xa0 What I can promise you, though, is that there will continue to be occasions with this President, as there have been with every one of his 43 predecessors, where there are meetings and events and moments that are not covered by the outside press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is saying that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I know, but I\'m saying -- but I\'m also saying that what I don\'t expect in response to improvements that we make that might be welcomed, that everybody will say, okay, now we\'re satisfied, because then you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing your job. And I get that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you acknowledge that this White House has provided less access than previous White Houses, for instance, to the Oval Office?\xc2\xa0 That you put out --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say that the statement in that piece about the Oval Office was factually wrong.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that in my experience as a reporter -- now, I wasn\'t a photographer -- the answer to that is I completely reject it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are you working on then?\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve provided more access --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying on the issue of photographers, I want to work with giving photographers more access.\xc2\xa0 They have come to us and been very clear about their concerns, and we want to address those concerns in the best way that we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question just about the Newtown anniversary?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what\'s the President think of this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I think I called on Brianna.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s 23 executive actions.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen this announcement about mental health.\xc2\xa0 What more is the White House planning?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'re two days away from the anniversary.\xc2\xa0 Not much has been accomplished.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question, as the President made abundantly clear, that he was extremely disappointed in Congress\'s failure to vote in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the American people in favor of common-sense improvements to our background check system.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to press Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to take action where we can without Congress to reduce gun violence in America, in keeping with the President\'s view that we can do that without in any way jeopardizing America\'s Second Amendment rights, which the President believes in.</p>\n<p>So there\'s no question that Congress failed to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, there\'s a limit on what a President can do.\xc2\xa0 Other actions require congressional movement.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made our views clear.\xc2\xa0 We, even before we launched the initiative to try to get legislation passed, made clear that our overall approach would include executive actions, the 23 that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 And while Congress, again, rejected the will of the vast majority of the American people, including majorities in the reddest of states in the United States, we pressed forward on the executive actions.\xc2\xa0 And the mental health issue that you raised is a significant issue and should not be dismissed, even as we all acknowledge our frustration with Congress\'s failure to act on expanding background checks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about pressing Congress.\xc2\xa0 But I think we really saw it late this summer what it really meant for this White House to kind of unleash a level of engagement with Congress that we haven\'t seen before.\xc2\xa0 And it was pressing for the use of force against Syria.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t see that when it came to gun laws.\xc2\xa0 Why haven\'t we seen that level of engagement?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I disagree.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think it was the same?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there was no issue that you covered more or that we engaged in more in the beginning of this year than that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the level of engagement with members of Congress -- the openness, the briefings, the discussion with members of the media -- you think that when it comes to Syria, that matches what the White House did when it comes to gun control?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I missed the stories where you said that our efforts on Syria were wildly successful with Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously it wasn\'t successful, but it was a risk.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that they were -- that the efforts we made on behalf of that legislation I think by anybody\xe2\x80\x99s fair reporting would be described as substantial and energetic and aggressive.\xc2\xa0 And I think you saw in what the President said out here in the Rose Garden how disappointed he was in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the will of the American people.</p>\n<p>Alexis, and then Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the photojournalists, just because this blew up in the briefing publicly, can you close the loop on what the President believes himself is -- now that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware that this is a public issue --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does he believe that the White House photography is sufficient?\xc2\xa0 Or is he --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, of course, not.\xc2\xa0 I think I said -- the first thing I said when I got this question was that from the President on down -- and I mean that -- there is absolute agreement that there\xe2\x80\x99s no substitute for a free and independent press reporting on a presidency or the White House, on Congress, on the government.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essential.\xc2\xa0 Essential.\xc2\xa0 And that includes photography.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with photographers to address their concerns.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 That is the view from the very top.\xc2\xa0 And I stipulate everything else I said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second question is, related to one of Mr. Souza\xe2\x80\x99s photographs, we saw that President Bush was sharing his new passion, his art, with those in the conference room.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether President Obama expressed some remarks or opinions about President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s paintings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear him comment on that.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, they were private conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read them out, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t privy to all of them.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been documented that former President Bush has spent a lot of time on that and I think the results are pretty impressive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you get a chance to see any paintings on the plane?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into conversations I might have had with the former President.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Question on Russia.\xc2\xa0 The President of Germany and a European Union official announced this week that they were going to personally boycott the Olympics in 2014 in Sochi out of concerns of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s human rights record, which, of course, includes the anti-gay propaganda law.\xc2\xa0 The White House has yet to announce who is going to be leading our delegation to the Sochi Olympics, even though that announcement was made four months ahead of time of the 2012 Olympics to London.\xc2\xa0 And Michelle Obama was the person who was leading the delegation at that time.\xc2\xa0 Is concern over Russia\xe2\x80\x99s human rights record the reason why an announcement has not been made for that delegation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on what that delegation will look like or the timing of that announcement.\xc2\xa0 I can be very clear that our views on the issues that you mention with regard to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights record have been abundantly clear, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear that we expect Russia to conduct Olympics in a way that respects the rights of all participants.\xc2\xa0 And that is what I said when this was an issue we talked about earlier, and it remains the case.</p>\n<p>So we don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on the delegation or when that will be announced or the particulars of the timing around the announcement except to repeat our views on this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the human rights record -- is that a source for anxiety in choosing who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be leading the delegation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on the process of choosing or naming the delegation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, yes, sorry.\xc2\xa0 In this, I always lose one of you.\xc2\xa0 You kind of blend together there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, and all you press secretaries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But not you, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping I don\xe2\x80\x99t blend in from this moment forward.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Uh-oh.\xc2\xa0 Now I just bought myself --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you acknowledge it was a missed opportunity not to bring the stills up on Air Force One, considering these conversations are ongoing and it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue raised and you\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged, and that it would have been an opportunity not only to provide a moment of history, which it genuinely was, and that there was ample time for it, and that it could have been arranged?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would have to take the question about Air Force One and consider it.\xc2\xa0 But I would say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m only asking about that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say broadly that in retrospect, I think we can always find occasions where I would agree that we should have or could have or might have found a way to provide more access.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that that reflects some of the discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having and will have with photographers and others about this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is certainly the case that Presidents Obama and Bush as well as the First Ladies were in public together quite a lot and photographed together quite a lot.\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as if that fact was not covered by the independent press.\xc2\xa0 But on this question and others, again, there are always worthy discussions to be had about what kind of access can be provided, and then also a realistic assessment of why sometimes, for a variety of reasons, it can be difficult or impossible to expand access or extend access to a certain event depending on what it is or who\xe2\x80\x99s involved and what the wishes of others might be who might be covered or photographed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can understand why we would consider it a missed opportunity?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I absolutely do, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 Beyond the bureaucracy, as I have already talked to the Secret Service -- they said it was the host committee\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility who was on the podium and the interpreter.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House satisfied with this fact that this person who suggests he might have had dangerous inclinations, but even if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, he was not an interpreter of merit, and he was possibly -- well, he was definitely in proximity to the President, and possibly things could have gone\xc2\xa0 -- are you satisfied with that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, forget about the bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about bureaucracy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the United States Secret Service is responsible for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and they negotiated with the South African government all the broad, general arrangements.\xc2\xa0 But the host committee was in charge of who was on the podium.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, is that -- knowing what you know now, are you satisfied with the way this was conducted?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not criticizing the Zuma government or anyone else.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that nobody -- if, in fact, the individual was not signing, that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, because that meant that people who rely on sign language to follow the speeches were not able to, and that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the security of the President and what actions and preparations are taken and made by the Secret Service, I have to refer you to the Secret Service, again, because they spend all of their time working on that, and also making assessments about whether, in retrospect, this was a problem or they\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied. That\xe2\x80\x99s just something they would have to assess and provide information on.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have it and I don\xe2\x80\x99t make those assessments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, our reporters and producers have talked to those in the moderate Syrian coalition.\xc2\xa0 They consider this short-term, or they believe it will be a short-term halting of nonlethal aid.\xc2\xa0 They expect the spigot to be open again very soon.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to see if you had anything additional you wanted to add on that.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel said today it\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly complicated situation.\xc2\xa0 Setbacks for the moderate forces make it even more so.\xc2\xa0 What new, if anything, do you have to add on the reestablishment of nonlethal air or the situation on the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the nonlethal aid has been suspended into northern Syria while we evaluate the situation and gather additional details in the wake of the seizure by Islamic Front forces of the Supreme Military Council warehouse that caused this reaction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We remain committed to the Supreme Military Council, the Syrian opposition, and we remain committed to a political resolution of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 The Geneva II talks are the process by which that reconciliation can move forward, and we support Geneva II and are working with our allies and the opposition to help bring about that conference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in terms of the reinstatement of that assistance, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date for you.\xc2\xa0 The evaluation of what happened is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And this is about -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about changing our minds about the need to provide nonlethal assistance.\xc2\xa0 We still believe that that is the right thing to do and essential to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s making -- this is about the security of the material assistance itself, and evaluating what happened, and working to make sure that when assistance resumes, that that assistance is safe and, therefore, distributed appropriately.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Iran.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, the technical conversations and negotiations are still going on about implementation of phase one, so as a practical matter, the six-month time clock has not actually begun.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that technical discussions are ongoing, and then once those are set, the clock is turned on and the six-month period begins.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions talk primarily on the Hill is about if after that six-month time expires and things have not been complied with by the Iranian side, then sanctions would -- new sanctions, tougher sanctions would begin.\xc2\xa0 So help me understand why the administration believes that is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because Congress can act in six months rather than act now on what they\xe2\x80\x99ll do in six months.\xc2\xa0 And by --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that signal to Iran about the cost of non-compliance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Iran is fully aware of the cost of non-compliance.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re so aware of it that they came to the table. They have been paying the price of non-compliance.\xc2\xa0 Failure --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you well know, Jay, coming to the table and agreeing to something is not the same thing as implementing it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely -- which is why if they fail to comply with their agreements in the preliminary round or fail to reach a comprehensive solution with the P5-plus-1, the sanctions regime remains in place, and the modest relief that is provided with the compliance by the Iranians with the first agreement --the preliminary agreement will be reversed.\xc2\xa0 And we would likely encourage both our partners internationally and Congress to respond to that failure to comply with additional sanctions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is our view that it is absolutely the wrong and worst time to take any action that undermines the chance for a diplomatic solution by dividing the international community and emboldening Iranian hardliners.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s what passage of new sanctions would do -- again, because the purpose of building this vast, comprehensive, and effective sanctions regime was to compel Iran to the negotiating table and to compel Iran to change its behavior, to make commitments to change its behavior.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have made progress as a result of the effectiveness of the sanctions, and now we need to test whether or not Iran is serious.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that by verifying their actions, verifying that they\xe2\x80\x99re in compliance, and making sure that, through their actions, rather than the documents they sign, or anything they may say, they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting their commitments.\xc2\xa0 Because ultimately the goal is -- the reason why we are where we are is that Iran has failed to meet its obligations to the United Nations Security Council and to the international community when it comes to development of a nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>Roger, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President, I understand, is going to be meeting with a group of mayors tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can say about that -- how many?\xc2\xa0 Purpose?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 It is true that on Friday the President will meet with a group of newly elected mayors from across the country to discuss the ways in which the Obama administration can serve as an active partner on job creation and ensuring middle-class families have a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n<p>This meeting builds on the unprecedented effort of the administration to partner with mayors working to implement policies that lead to high-paying, high-skilled jobs in their communities.\xc2\xa0 Mayors understand that smart investments in things like American manufacturing and infrastructure help provide good jobs for middle-class families while providing a foundation for long-term economic success.</p>\n<p>I have a list of participants if you\'d like me to read them, or we can provide them to you after the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Your call.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Later.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed says later.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Either way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got the mayors -- or mayors elect of Los Angeles, California; St. Petersburg, Florida; Boston, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Jersey City, New Jersey; New York, New York; Rochester, New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Greensborough, North Carolina; Cincinnati, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Seattle, Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And a quick follow up -- you started off the briefing with the preexisting announcement.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Children with preexisting conditions, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CMS extended that deadline for sign-up for those who are in the program now to January 31st.\xc2\xa0 Was the reason the concern that the people in the program now haven\'t had a chance to sign up, or have you found an alternative program?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The transitional coverage known as the Preexisting Condition Insurance Plan, which was the plan that was established with the ACA -- with Obamacare\'s passage, to provide in the interim before implementation of the Affordable Care Act those with preexisting conditions who have been denied insurance the opportunity to purchase some insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s called PCIP, or Preexisting Condition Insurance Plan.\xc2\xa0 And as part of our efforts to smooth the transition to the marketplaces for those seeking coverage that begins in January, we are taking steps to ensure that Americans enrolled in that plan, the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Plan, will not face a lapse in coverage come January.</p>\n<p>For example, HHS will be offering individuals currently enrolled in the PCIP who have not yet secured other health insurance the option to remain in that plan for the month of January.\xc2\xa0 PCIP is and was designed to be a transitional bridge program established under the Affordable Care Act that allowed people with health conditions who, until 2014, could otherwise be shut out of the insurance marketplace, or charged more because of their preexisting condition, the chance to enroll in quality, affordable health insurance until options became available in the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is essentially --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is that people haven\'t gotten enough coverage yet; that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\'re being -- the program is being extended?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In the universe of people -- some have already changed coverage, and this is for those who have not and want an extra month to smooth that transition, again, because this was an option provided to those with preexisting conditions in anticipation of -- a bridge, essentially -- of the period where, by law, insurance companies could no longer deny you coverage and could no longer jack up your rates because you had a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:15 P.M.
