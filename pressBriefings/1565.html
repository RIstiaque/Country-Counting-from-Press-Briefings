Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>  \xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">2:40 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Elliott, take us away.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of thousands of people are marching in Tehran today.\xc2\xa0 I know the administration is trying to stay out of the drama going on following the Iranian elections.\xc2\xa0 But is there a point where the President would be comfortable stepping in saying enough is enough?\xc2\xa0 Perhaps a timeline, or numbers of people that have been hurt or injured, or numbers of people in the streets?\xc2\xa0 Is there a threshold?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Phil, our response is -- I think on this has been, from the very beginning, consistent even before the election.\xc2\xa0 I was asked if -- about our candidate of preference.\xc2\xa0 I said that the United States wasn\'t in the position of picking candidates for President.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has spoken to, in many ways, the causes and concerns of many that are marching in Iran by demonstrating, one, that he shares their concern and the international concern about the way the election was conducted.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, he believes that there is a universal principle of demonstrating without the fear of harm.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  So I think he has expressed on both of those -- in both of those areas concern for the way the election was conducted and concern to ensure that demonstrators can peaceably carry out their demonstrations.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow-up on financial regulation from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 One thing that struck a few observers is the fact that the proposals that came out yesterday did not mention rating and speculation in oil markets.\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 And is that something that the administration plans to address in a future proposal?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it\'s a part of a future proposal, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 I know that one of the great concerns that drove -- or the great concern that drove the process for financial regulatory reform that was outlined by the President yesterday was ensuring that the causes for the economic catastrophe that we saw over the past many months and the lack of regulation that caused many of those events be remedied to ensure that they don\'t happen again.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what drove the creation of the proposal.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what drove the President to create -- or seek to create an agency that protects consumers and has their best interests in mind.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful and we see encouraging words from Congress that this proposal can be gotten through the legislative process this year and signed into law by the President.<br/> <br/>  Now, that having been said, I don\'t doubt, and you see it in reports today, very organized, very powerful special interests that will oppose the creation of the consumer agency or different aspects of the proposal.\xc2\xa0 But the President intends to fight for each and every one of those.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But energy speculation is certainly something that the President as a candidate expressed concern about.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you still concerned about speculation in the oil markets, and will there be something to address that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President\'s concern has changed.\xc2\xa0 I think yesterday\'s thrust was to ensure that what had gotten us into this mess over the past many, many months -- and, remember, this speech dates back to one of the -- a speech that the President gave that wasn\'t altogether noticed a lot in September of 2007 on Wall Street, and that we had to take steps to ensure that this never happened again.\xc2\xa0 And that was the thrust of what was going on yesterday.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about this before a little bit, but there\'s more recent polling indicating that while President Obama\'s personal popularity is still quite strong, there are concerns among the American people and less support for some of his policies, specifically his economic policies, whether it\'s spending proposals, the bailout of the auto industry, the deficit, the stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering what you think is going on, whether you guys haven\'t made your argument as well as you could, or what exactly the dynamic is that Americans, although still a majority supporting the President on some of these economic policies, seem to -- there seems to be something of an ebb.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you can look at recent polling from the past day or so -- you can go back a week or so -- I think the American people are rightly frustrated with where the economy is and how we ended up where we did.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people and the President both are greatly concerned about the deficit.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  I think that -- you know, look, numbers and different questions bounce around, but when you look at something like the auto industry -- look, the President knew that wasn\'t a decision that was based off of something that was wildly popular, but the President believed it was something important to do to ensure the viability of an American auto industry, to ensure that towns and communities and companies had a chance to thrive again, and thought it was part of what we had to do to get our economy back on track.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Some of those things are popular, some of those things aren\'t popular.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would tell you that he\'s going to do what he thinks is in the best interest of the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Some of those things will be, as I said, more popular than others.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think the American people are rightly anxious and concerned about the economy, just as the President is.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other question.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be some wrangling right now between the Treasury Department and the Special Inspector General of TARP, Neil Barofsky, about how independent Barofsky\'s office in TARP is.\xc2\xa0 And based on the letter that Senator Grassley sent and response from Special Inspector General Barofsky, it seems like the independence of his office has been challenged; he hasn\'t been able to get all the documents he\'s wanted from the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 And Grassley even suggested that an outside agency has been -- or an outside entity of some sort has been asked to weigh in.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what exactly is going on and --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen Senator Grassley\'s letter, so I\'m not as familiar with that.\xc2\xa0 I will look into it.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is -- has talked about, whether it\'s in recovery or TARP or other programs, making sure -- ensuring that there is the type of accountability that Americans expect when we\'re using their tax dollars.\xc2\xa0 So let me take a look.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Inspector General Barofsky should be able to get whatever documents he needs?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we want to ensure that there\'s sufficient accountability.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know any of the details on this, but let me check.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Iran, is there an internal debate in the White House now between those who clearly support what the President is doing in terms of the hands-off approach and those who think the President needs to have some stronger language?\xc2\xa0 Is that ongoing in the White House?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\'s no debate in the White House.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Never?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there division at all?\xc2\xa0 Is everyone on the same page on this, or are there those who think that the President -- internally, that the President is --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Everybody is on the same page.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no difference of opinion.\xc2\xa0 I think the only thing I might take -- the only thing I would take some exception to is the notion that the President has been hands-off.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of not wanting to interfere with the election.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think that\'s a fairly time-honored principle.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President has been -- has talked about, and we talked about it from my statement on Sunday and every statement either by me or other administration officials and by the President, concern about how this election was conducted, as well as stating, as I said earlier to Phil\'s question, ensuring that the world knows and that people in Iran know of our belief that they have the right to have their causes and concerns heard and not fear violence, while at the same time respecting that this is a debate being had in Iran, by Iranians, about their leadership.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at Democrats and Republicans alike, they share where the President has been on this as we continue to watch the developments unfold.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow, what is the plan for the Father\'s Day -- I understand the President might have some visitors here, and perhaps a town hall meeting with that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there\'s a town hall.\xc2\xa0 I know there will be some visitors.\xc2\xa0 I know there will be some -- we\'ll have some names for you later today, and hopefully, I know some senior staff will be participating in ensuring that we\'re talking about mentoring and fatherhood.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have more on that a little bit later on today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it informal or a formal kind of event where --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, it would be a formal event here, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Ethan coming?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if Ethan is coming; I should make sure that he is.\xc2\xa0 He could tear some stuff up.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said there\'s no difference of opinion.\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve been led to believe this President seeks out different opinions from his advisors.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got these incredibly knowledgeable people sitting around the room.\xc2\xa0 He can\'t find a single person who does anything other than nod, "Yes, Mr. President, you\'re absolutely right on this"?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how can there not be -- how can there not be some difference of opinion on this?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There is a belief by all here that this is a debate that, as I\'ve said I think every day for the last five days, four days, plus my statement, that the American people and this government are not going to pick the next leader of Iran.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that the Iranians have to do.<br/> <br/>  We have to ensure that we express our views, as I\'ve said, about ensuring that people can demonstrate, have their causes and concerns heard.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what people here believe.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there nobody who believes he ought to be a little more open in supporting the demonstrators?\xc2\xa0 Nobody has expressed that opinion to him?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Everybody is on the same page.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just absolutely verbatim?\xc2\xa0 Nobody --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We walk around like robots, Chip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we quote you on that?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Too late.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s already there.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s on the record -- I\'m a senior administration official -- (laughter) -- robotic knowledge of Robert Gibbs\' thinking.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you say "We\'re all on the same page."\xc2\xa0 But the world sees many members of the United States government, members on Capitol Hill, who believe that --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip didn\'t ask me did the entire Congress believe everything --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say that -- no, no, no, no --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That I can tell you on the record is likely not the case.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 Does the President or does the administration believe --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A little delayed back there, Lester.\xc2\xa0 What was the --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, we\'re on the seven-second --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, I know, it\'s --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- delay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that the vocal criticism of -- that members of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, and many very prominent members of Congress, have said -- have spoken out forcefully in favor of the demonstrators, do members of the administration believe that\'s a bad thing for the U.S. government to be doing?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s not -- it\'s not the tack that we\'ve taken.\xc2\xa0 But, Chuck, let\'s --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should the government -- I mean, are you guys reaching out quietly to members on Capitol Hill, saying, hey, guys, this is what our intelligence is saying, you shouldn\'t be doing this?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, I appreciate the opportunity to get Congress to agree with everything that we believe.\xc2\xa0 I will wait and see whether that comes to fruition.\xc2\xa0 Again --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is a national security issue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not uncommon sometimes for -<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, let\'s be honest.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s -- but hold on.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for the White House to reach out to Capitol Hill and say, hey --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but let\'s be honest.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- let me tell you what we know.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You make it sound monolithically like the President is saying one thing and everybody else is saying another thing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not even true in the Republican Party, right?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think it\'s good that there are members out there, prominent members of the United States government, saying --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President and his team are responsible for what the President and his team say.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into what motivates other people to do or say what they do or say.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President believes that he\'s struck the right tone, and as do others in the administration, as do others in the Republican Party, as do others in the Democratic Party.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re not reaching out?\xc2\xa0 Nobody in this administration is reaching out to members of Congress who have been very vocal in saying, can you buy us some time, can you give us a few days to get this sort of --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Give us a few days for what?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To see what happens.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems to be --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think everybody is watching what happens, but I\'m not -- you know, I\'m not -- ask for two days to do what?\xc2\xa0 Count the ballots<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the critics -- the very vocal criticism that is now --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But what are we asking for a few days for?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking you.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 Okay, fine, one other question.\xc2\xa0 Can you reconcile -- it\'s always this one night only.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the second time, I think, that the President is going to go to a fundraiser in the DCCC and the DSCC, this one night only.\xc2\xa0 They won\'t take lobbyists\' money and all this stuff --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President won\'t be involved in a fundraiser that does that.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as the titular head of the Democratic Party, why doesn\'t he have any influence to change the rules of the two major national committees?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think people know where the President stands.\xc2\xa0 I think -- we\'re the head of the DNC, and they don\'t take lobbyists\' money, and the President is not going to be involved in fundraisers where that happens.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s the Democratic Party -- I mean, you\'re head of the Democratic Party, why can\'t you have this influence on the DSCC or the DCCC?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Call Bob Menendez.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There has been criticism that the regulatory reform plan centralizes too much power with the Fed.\xc2\xa0 How do you ensure that there are enough checks and balances on the central bank, and is the President open to alternatives that could put this balance somewhere else?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s understand -- let me push a little bit on the premise of your question, because some of the powers that the Fed currently has that will be put in as part of our proposal in the consumer agency, I don\'t -- I think if you\'re removing some of those powers, that isn\'t necessarily consolidating within one entity.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there is with the Fed a knowledge, a technical expertise, and a jurisdiction over a number of already regulatory issues, and we think this proposal strikes the right balances to ensure that this doesn\'t happen again.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he open to alternatives that could --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll see -- we\'ll certainly see what Congress comes up with as the process goes, but I think the President feels -- I think the President feels enormously comfortable with his proposal.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the Pentagon says it\'s tracking a North Korean vessel that may be in breach of U.N. sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what role the President is playing in weighing in on rules of engagement with such vessels?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into intelligence matters.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve certainly seen some of these reports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you know because we had Ambassador Rice last week discussing what this administration and countries in the U.N. believed were important tools for acting against North Korea moving missile parts or nuclear material or what have you as part of a proliferation regime.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. took some very strong, strict steps through those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the specific intelligence, though, of this, except to point you to what I know that has been said publicly at the Pentagon today.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on rules of engagement, if the North Korean vessel were to fire on a U.S. vessel, would the President be the one as Commander-in-Chief to authorize returning fire?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I could check on the rules of engagement.\xc2\xa0 I presume that the -- as was the case in other instances that we\'ve dealt with, the Commander-in-Chief also has great confidence in commanders in the theater.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been some slip in the schedule on the consideration of health care on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned that a draft might not be done by the August recess?\xc2\xa0 And if it\'s not, is it okay if it slips until later in the fall?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President believes that this is -- there are a lot of moving parts, this is part of the long process.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s a surprise that this is going to take some time to do.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an issue that we\'ve been discussing for 40 years.\xc2\xa0 So the President isn\'t pessimistic about being able to get this through Congress this year.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Mark\'s question, when he was at the press conference in the Rose Garden with President Lee, the President was asked if the U.S. is not going to board the vessels, what practical effect these new U.N. sanctions would have.\xc2\xa0 And he said, "What the U.S. is going to do will be worked out in the coming months in conversations with the Russians, the Japanese, the Chinese, other member nations and those in the region."\xc2\xa0 Now that the Pentagon has confirmed the tracking of this vessel, it would appear that those conversations would need to take on a degree of urgency.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration worked out clearly in its own mind what its procedures are going to be in tracking this vessel to -- in order to enforce the U.N. sanctions?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not going to get into commenting on sort of specific instances --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking you to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what the President said.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me try to finish one.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look through, as Ambassador Rice discussed, there are some specific actions that have to be taken by countries who are near these ships, whose waters these ships are in, ports that they might be destined for that are all part of this process.\xc2\xa0 But I think the White House feels comfortable and confident that we have an understanding of what this resolution does.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how it intends to enforce it as a member state called upon under the resolutions to enforce it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the debate that\'s going on in Iran and developments as they unfold.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe those who have been killed as peaceful demonstrators are victims of human rights violations or crimes?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything specific on this except I think the President has -- on a couple of occasions, he\'s been asked and he\'s deplored violence and unnecessary killing, of course.\xc2\xa0 The President was very clear and direct that violence is not the answer; that demonstrators have what he called a universal principle to act peacefully and not fear for their own safety.\xc2\xa0 And I think the international community and the world know where this President, and my guess is others throughout the world, where they stand on ensuring that we don\'t see violence or unnecessary killing.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the banking regulations, when he was testifying today Treasury Secretary Geithner was asked if the problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contributed to the financial meltdown.\xc2\xa0 His one-word answer was "absolutely."\xc2\xa0 Does the administration wish that the Treasury Secretary and his team had put in more regulations or new types of enforcement procedures for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were not a part of this proposal?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with the Treasury Secretary on what they\'re doing as it relates to that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that assessment, that those two entities were absolutely part of the problem?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am -- because -- in honor of Chip, I will tell you "absolutely."<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said a couple times, Robert, that the administration -- there\'s concern about how this election was conducted in Iran.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration convinced this was fraudulent, the election was fraudulent?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this administration shares the concern, again, expressed by the international community, about the results, and concern about some of the procedures surrounding that.\xc2\xa0 I think those are investigations that are ongoing and we strongly believe that this should be looked into.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not convinced that the election was --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, just as I\'m not going to pick the leader, the United States isn\'t going to be the investigative body here.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you seen some of the reporting and polling that suggests that perhaps these results could be valid?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen reporting on it.\xc2\xa0 I think -- but I\'ve -- we\'ve also seen other reporting on other aspects of the election.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last thing on this.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had mentioned early on you had enumerated a couple of your concerns -- Mousavi losing his home district and some things like that.\xc2\xa0 Have you gathered any more specific information that feed your concerns?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'ve gotten particularly from NSC on this, no.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the presidential campaign, several times Senator Obama would say -- would criticize the way things work in Washington and the way things are explained in Washington.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if he would find any hypocrisy in the fundraising going on at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel using that standard that he used to describe things as when he was running as an outsider?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- what criticism are you --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he find this -- would the old Senator Obama find this hypocritical?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Find what hypocritical?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that on Thursday evening, he\'ll be raising money where lobbyists are not allowed; Friday morning, lobbyists will be allowed.\xc2\xa0 When he said during the campaign, "We will not take a dime," I\'m wondering if the candidate Obama would find those 12 hours hypocritical.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that the policy that we had in the campaign is the policy that we have as President.\xc2\xa0 We stand by what we said in the campaign, and we haven\'t changed that policy now that we\'re here.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President has been consistent, has taken steps, both in the Senate and as a candidate and as a President, to reduce the influence of special interests in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\'ll continue to do that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you think his actions tonight reduce the influence of special interests in Washington?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not taking their money.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to -- following up on the health care question before, the congressional schedule -- health care has slipped a bit and may be slipping further.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got a Sotomayor nomination coming up; energy, climate change.\xc2\xa0 And now you\'ve asked for the biggest overhaul of the financial system in a half-century or so.\xc2\xa0 Is this really --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 North Korea, Iran --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re making my point.\xc2\xa0 Is there no concern here that some of this stuff is just going to drop off the map?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s concern that -- there\'s always concern that the President -- the President always has concerns that we have many problems and that we have to work quickly to deal with them, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But, as we discussed in here some of the polling, I think one of the questions was, as has been posed by many of you, do you think the President is dealing with the issues that confront him, or do you think he\'s doing too much?\xc2\xa0 I would denote that 60 percent of the American people felt like he was dealing with the issues that are put on his plate.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  I\'ll say again what the President always says.\xc2\xa0 He would -- trust me, Mark -- love to come to work one day and we give him -- take away all these red folders and say, "Good news, boss, today there\'s nothing to do.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just as a tactical matter.\xc2\xa0 Was there not any thought given to try and spread some of this out so that it didn\'t all hit at once on Capitol Hill?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I mean, you know, we don\'t control when justices retire from the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t control when the economy takes a massive downturn.\xc2\xa0 Lord knows we don\'t control what the North Koreans do or say.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can\'t you control energy proposals?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but we also don\'t -- you know, we don\'t have -- we don\'t control the fact that -- well, we do have -- I should say this, we do have control over the fact that we import a greater import of our energy today than we did 30 years ago when Presidents walked up to Capitol Hill and said they were going to end our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 We do have the ability to ensure that small businesses that are watching their premiums skyrocket and have to drop their coverage, we have control over that, and we think -- and we believe Congress believes that those are the problems of the American people and they should be addressed.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell us about the red folders.\xc2\xa0 Are you color-coding issues?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The ones that say "Top Secret" are generally red.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll give you that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that right?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, last Friday, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan came to the White House and she met with President Obama and Rahm Emanuel and Valerie, and they wanted to try to convince her to run for the Senate from Illinois.\xc2\xa0 Were these one meetings or three, and why do they want her to run for Senate?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just -- let me be explicit.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- the President is not going to pick a candidate in the Illinois Senate race.\xc2\xa0 The President has a very long relationship with the Attorney General, dating back to their time in the State Senate, and has enormous respect for what she accomplished there and has as Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 I think she\'d be a terrific candidate.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not going to get involved in picking that candidate in Illinois.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by having -- when you say that, and bear with me --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this meeting was designed to help get her to run.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what her -- are you saying that\'s not true?\xc2\xa0 Then why did you call her into the White House, or somebody did?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether she got called in or she came in.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So could you find it out, by the way?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I might.\xc2\xa0 I might not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Robert, when you say that, it just doesn\'t make -- it doesn\'t square with the reality on the ground that she is -- the DSCC is doing a poll -- has been polling for her --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I would refer you to any number of the questions that clearly denote that I don\'t control the DSCC --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- from both rows one and two.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, then let\'s go to what you do -- could you --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, but I appreciate being able to not have -- or have responsibility for rows one and two, but not for rows four.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, could you just try and say more succinctly and clearly what you said --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought what I said was fairly succinct and clear.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you said that they\'re not trying to recruit her to run, when in fact every point is that that meeting was to get her to run.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said we\'re not picking a candidate, we\'re not going to endorse in this race.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have enormous respect for the Attorney General?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That was succinct and rather clear.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait, has the President prohibited members of his staff from weighing in and helping a particular candidate?\xc2\xa0 He won\'t pick a candidate, but --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The White House is not going to pick a candidate.\xc2\xa0 The staff assistants aren\'t going to pick a candidate --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are they free to help?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the President is --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why go as far as you just did --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they free to help particular candidates?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why did I go so far as to --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As to talk about what a great candidate she would make?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because the President has --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know the power of those words matter, too.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has enormous respect for her, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 He sat next to her in the State Senate.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, have they tried to recruit her, even if there\'s not going to be an endorsement?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to get involved in this race.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t it meaningless for him not to pick a particular candidate if his staff is out there working on behalf of one particular candidate?\xc2\xa0 Has he said --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just said his staff isn\'t going to do that, Chip, so I took that off the table.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So has he prohibited them from getting involved in it in any way?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me be succinct and clear.\xc2\xa0 I said the staff assistants aren\'t going to pick a candidate, the assistants to the President aren\'t going to pick a candidate, and the President is not going to pick a candidate.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does this meeting fit within what you just said, that the White House is not going to get involved in this race?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President enjoyed meeting with the Attorney General --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with everyone else?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they\'ve asked.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think Carolyn Maloney would be a terrific candidate for New York?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to get into something --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with everyone else in Illinois?\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with everyone else in Illinois?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If people want to meet, the address is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\'t he think Carolyn Maloney is terrific?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A question about Iran again.\xc2\xa0 Earlier today, a few hours ago, John McCain, on his Twitter feed, said -- and it\'s short, as it has to be -- "Mass peaceful demonstrations in Iran today; let\'s support them and stand up for democracy and freedom!"<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Was that vociferousness or are you --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "The President and his administration should do the same."\xc2\xa0 Do you think that it is helpful, or not helpful, for members of Congress to be making declarations like this, and putting pressure on the White House to do and say more?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to get involved into commenting on the motivations that other members may have.\xc2\xa0 I know some people agree with what Senator McCain said; some people agree with what other Republicans have said that\'s very much like the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes that we should and have spoken out to ensure that demonstrators have the universal right and principle to demonstrate without fear of harm.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we have to respect their sovereignty.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, former President George Bush gave a speech yesterday where he talked about Guantanamo Bay and the President\'s policy, and he said, "Therapy is not going to cause terrorists to change their minds."\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s reaction to that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is he talking -- I don\'t -- I\'m not sure what he\'s discussing.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s trying to suggest that the President\'s policy on Guantanamo Bay is not the right policy and saying -- comparing it to therapy, that we\'re treating the prisoners --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what he\'s discussing.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I know the previous administration moved or transferred hundreds of detainees at Guantanamo to a program in Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that\'s what he\'s -- maybe that\'s not what he\'s referring to, since it appears to be contrary to the actions that he took.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m happy if he can clarify what it is he was talking about.<br/> <br/>  I think we\'ve had a debate about individual policies.\xc2\xa0 We had that debate in particular -- we kept score last November and we won.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he also talked about -- saying that the private sector is better handled to help the economy more than the government.\xc2\xa0 And do you just have any response to him taking a swipe at President Obama after remaining kind of on the sidelines for so long?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think the President -- President Obama inherited an economic catastrophe:\xc2\xa0 massive unemployment, a huge deficit, insolvent banks, car companies that were being handed billions of dollars to perpetuate a plan that had them coming back every three months to ask for more.\xc2\xa0 The President -- President Obama took action to pass a recovery plan and to take steps to put some regulation back in our economy<br/> <br/>  President Obama believes that the free market is what governs our economic principles and looks forward to getting out of the business of being involved in banks or in auto companies.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to President Bush?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'ve spoken.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how recently.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I think he pointed to me.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll go to Carol, then I\'ll come back to you.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that Muslim women can be forced to remove their veils when they\'re testifying in court as the --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I can\'t --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that Muslim women can be forced to remove their veils when testifying in court as the Michigan Supreme Court ruled yesterday?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not familiar with the ruling.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President would view as constitutional?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look at the ruling and have somebody in the Counsel\'s Office --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Hamas, there has been some really frightening footage on a few of the networks about Hamas or al Qaeda -- whatever you want to call them -- strapping explosives on horses, and preparing to blow up the horses to attack in Israel.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any knowledge of this, and do you still favor this two-state solution if they\'re going to have these tactics by Hamas or al Qaeda in Gaza -- coming from Gaza?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not seen the footage.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if anybody here has.\xc2\xa0 Connie, the President continues to believe that it\'s in the best security of both the Israelis and the Palestinians to be involved in a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was clear at his speech in Cairo where he stands on Hamas and what they have to do to be more responsible.\xc2\xa0 That includes recognizing Israel, relinquishing their support for terror, and abiding by past agreements.\xc2\xa0 Those are their responsibilities and their obligations.<br/> <br/>  George.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following your answer on the Fed, there are those in Congress who want to use the President\'s regulatory reform package to greatly increase congressional oversight of the Fed, particularly spending and disbursement of money.\xc2\xa0 Is that something you\'d resist or -<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen those proposals, and obviously this is a process that\'s going to wind its way through.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you that the President hopes and looks forward to signing much stronger financial regulations by the end of this year to ensure that what\'s happened doesn\'t happen again.<br/> <br/>  Bill.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to health care and the public option for just a minute.\xc2\xa0 The Heritage Foundation put out an open letter on health care today where they say "the inclusion of a public option is nothing more than a Trojan Horse \xe2\x80\xa6 Once a government plan is in place, private insurance companies will be eventually run out of business."\xc2\xa0 Is that your secret agenda here?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President addressed the critics of this using the exact example of Trojan Horse in front of the AMA on Monday.\xc2\xa0 Since we\'ve talked about polling here today, I think we can discuss that one of the polls that was out in the last 24 hours showed extremely strong support for a public option that provides the uninsured with choice and competition that is so greatly needed.\xc2\xa0 Those are two universal values that we hear discussed a lot in the health care debate.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to have choice?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to have competition?\xc2\xa0 Those are values that the President believes are important in this debate; rejects this notion that seems to be perpetuated in the letter that you\'re talking about, that this is in any way a takeover of health care -- I think that\'s patently ridiculous -- but it provides a choice and some competition and in the end will drive down costs.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the other hand, Senator Tom Daschle today, -- who, of course, first choice for HHS Secretary -- said that the public plan option could be dropped and maybe should be dropped if it gets in the way of getting a bill this year.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes it\'s a strong component of getting the right type of reform this year.\xc2\xa0 We\'re a strong supporter of including that option because, as I said, it provides choice and competition and it drives down costs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President is most concerned with, is ensuring that those that haven\'t had the luxury of having affordable health care coverage get an opportunity to enter a market where they can find an option that is affordable.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Putting aside the Illinois example, I\'m wondering if you can characterize generally what you expect the White House\'s level of involvement is going to be working with the campaign committees in the races this year and next, and also how involved you think the President will be personally on the campaign trail?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has -- obviously the President has some interest in the makeup of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President I think is obviously going to be involved with the committees; that\'s denoted by our presence and participation tonight.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ll -- obviously his first priority is getting this economy fixed and ensuring that we lay a foundation for long-term economic growth.\xc2\xa0 But I know he\'ll be out there campaigning, as well.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just one?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care reform, one of the other --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I might come back.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m feeling frisky.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Appreciate that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned all the moving parts in health care reform and one of the other options is to have a nonprofit cooperative.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered why the White House wouldn\'t entertain that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Nancy-Ann and others have discussed the fact that those options are constructive and can and should be discussed as part of health care reform.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as I said and you said back to me, there are a lot of moving parts and this is going to be a long process.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s not going to be solved in a matter of weeks or a matter of just a couple weeks, but a number of proposals that the White House sees as very constructive.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I\'m feeling good today -- let\'s just do it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us if, as you said yesterday in the briefing --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Uh-oh.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- quote, "the President is committed to ensuring fairness" --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm to you that the President is committed to ensuring fairness.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how, then, he and you feel about two brief statements mailed by two candidates for the White House Correspondents executive board -- they\'re just two sentences.\xc2\xa0 First:\xc2\xa0 "Even reporters in the first three rows have told me that they feel the inequity demonstrated by the Press Secretary is insupportable -- the need to recognize all journalists in the room, not just a few."\xc2\xa0 And the second:\xc2\xa0 "One hour and one minute passed before Robert Gibbs reached our colleagues in the third row, and soon after, the briefing was over."\xc2\xa0 How do you and the President believe this is fairness?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I don\'t want to be party to your attacking the fine journalists that work and inhabit the first three rows of the Brady briefing room.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t attack them.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t attack them.\xc2\xa0 These were candidates.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you pick a candidate, Robert?\xc2\xa0 Could you pick a candidate?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That were their statements.\xc2\xa0 What about that, Robert?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to moderate a debate?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is a debate -- this is a debate that should be had by correspondents as correspondents choose their own leadership.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is aimed at you.\xc2\xa0 This is a question for you.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, I understand, and I\'m not running for anything in the White House Correspondents Association.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have a good place to stand already.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Thanks, Lester.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  3:24 P.M.
