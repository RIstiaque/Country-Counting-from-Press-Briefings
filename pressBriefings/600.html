Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:14 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are there some Blackhawks fans here?\xc2\xa0 Must be. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been announced, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a call time for the Chicago Blackhawks event.\xc2\xa0 Anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s going there should not feel badly at all if they get up and leave.\xc2\xa0 I will understand -- or we could just end it when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you.</p>\n<p>A couple of toppers for you on this good Monday early afternoon.\xc2\xa0 First of all, tomorrow the President will host a meeting in the Roosevelt Room with top business leaders to discuss the importance of getting immigration reform done to bolster U.S. economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Immigration reform will reduce the deficit by nearly $850 billion over the first 20 years, and it will grow the economy by $1.4 trillion over 20 years, which adds 5.4 percent to the GDP by 2033.\xc2\xa0 It has broad bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans, business and labor leaders, law enforcement and faith leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is willing to work with people on both sides of the aisle to get this done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for business, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for our economy as a whole and it is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 We believe it is time for the House to follow the Senate and take action.</p>\n<p>Secondly, as you are already aware, as early as this evening, the Senate may vote on S.815, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would place into law lasting and comprehensive federal protections against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\xc2\xa0 The President has long supported an inclusive ENDA, and you may have seen his op-ed in the Huffington Post calling upon Congress to pass this bill so he can sign it into law.</p>\n<p>We continue to urge lawmakers to act on this important legislation, because in America, who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense.\xc2\xa0 Qualified workers should not fear being fired from their jobs or otherwise denied the chance to earn a living for themselves and their families simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\xc2\xa0 This is about upholding America\xe2\x80\x99s core values of fairness and equality.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to that vote in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on that, House Speaker John Boehner said this morning that he opposes ENDA.\xc2\xa0 I know that you got this question last week, but now that it looks more realistic that the Senate could pass this and the House could not, does the President feel like signing an executive order is something that is in his power, or does he feel like this can only be done by Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have long supported an inclusive legislative path to dealing with employment non-discrimination -- employment discrimination of LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 I noted, and others here noted, Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s comments with regret.\xc2\xa0 And his reasoning behind the position he took sounds familiar to the opposition to all -- almost all -- civil rights measures that have come and been passed into law in this country over the years.\xc2\xa0 That opposition was wrong then and it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong now.</p>\n<p>So we will continue to fight for this legislation to move through.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that it may be taken or accepted as a fait accompli that because the Speaker has said this and taken this position that it cannot move through the House, but I would point you to instances where that has not proved to be the case, as recently as the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which we saw happen, fortunately, earlier this year.</p>\n<p>So I think that the support for this is overwhelming.\xc2\xa0 The support for it is overwhelming across the country, and in states that you might not expect it to be very popular it is very strongly supported.\xc2\xa0 So we need to continue to pressure Congress to -- or the American people to get this done because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear about the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, does he feel like Congress is the only option for taking this action, or does he feel like he has the executive power to do this on his own if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get through Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about this is two things. One, the preferable and better path has been through Congress, because that would be inclusive.\xc2\xa0 An executive order that addresses federal contractors obviously would not be inclusive; it would not extend beyond federal contracts.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on getting ENDA through Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When I used to answer questions about an executive order by saying that, there was great skepticism that we would get this far.\xc2\xa0 And we have come to a moment where it looks quite likely, or quite possible, that the Senate will pass this.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep pressing ahead.</p>\n<p>I would note that there was a poll earlier this year that showed support for ENDA at 75 for and 14 percent against -- pretty good numbers.\xc2\xa0 And that was in Texas -- 75-14 in Texas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What poll?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, on health care, a few lawmakers, including Dianne Feinstein, over the weekend, said that they want to see the administration just take down the healthcare.gov site while these fixes are happening.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that is even an option as far as the White House is concerned?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, for sort of technical questions about how they\xe2\x80\x99re going about identifying, isolating and fixing the various problems with the website, I would refer you to CMS and their regular briefings.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that there are periods where, on a regular basis, the website is taken down for some of this work to be done, and that has been the case going back into October.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Taking it down sort of on a semi-permanent basis until all of these bugs are fixed, is that anything that is being discussed in the President\xe2\x80\x99s updates?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard discussed.\xc2\xa0 My understanding -- and I would point you to what Jeff Zients and others have said -- is that the site is fixable and that there is an enormous amount of work going on on a daily basis to make the necessary fixes and to upgrade the site with the goal of making it fully functional for the vast majority of users by the end of this month.\xc2\xa0 And that work continues.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that even as that work continues to improve the website, which, unquestionably, needs improvement, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged, people are able to get online, get information that they need, sign up and enroll.\xc2\xa0 The problem has been that not enough people have been able to do that and too many people throughout this period since launch have experienced frustrating delays or difficulties in making that happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But from day one -- far too few, in our view, obviously, because of the poorly functioning website -- from day one, people have been able to use it to get information and enroll, and that has improved as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been addressing the problems that exist.\xc2\xa0 So, in our view, we\xe2\x80\x99re able to do this so that the website is functioning for the vast majority of users at acceptable standards by the end of this month.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s event tonight, speaking with the OFA?\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to get from it and what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about the importance of the Affordable Care Act and the benefits that it provides to every American and, in particular, those millions of Americans who are either underinsured or uninsured.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a big effort underway to make sure that Americans across the country get the information they need, understand what benefits are available to them, including tax credits that are available to them, in order to purchase affordable and quality health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that effort, including with the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks tonight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to ask about Iran, if I could.\xc2\xa0 This week, there will be talks on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 Today is the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979. What do you expect from talks?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any sense that Iran might come up with new ideas later this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, the history of mistrust between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran is deep and it will not be erased overnight.\xc2\xa0 But what we are doing now is not about trust.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in serious and substantive negotiations that offer the possibility that we can stop the advance of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, gain more transparency into their nuclear activities, and negotiate a long-term, comprehensive solution that resolves the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to achieve a verifiable agreement that does not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, obviously, that the window is open for us to pursue this option, to achieve our goal of not allowing Iran to possess a nuclear weapon, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to aggressively pursue that while the window is open.\xc2\xa0 But it won\xe2\x80\x99t remain open indefinitely.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going into this eyes wide open, but as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in the past, we need to take advantage of this opportunity to see if, in fact, Iran is serious about addressing the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns when it comes to its nuclear weapons program in a way that is verifiable for the United States and the whole international community that\'s concerned about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you take any message or any significance from the fact that protesters continue to chant \xe2\x80\x9cdeath to America\xe2\x80\x9d in demonstrations marking the anniversary of the event?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we believe that the vast majority of Iranians would prefer a better relationship with the West and would prefer the benefits of that better relationship with the West, including the economic benefits of rejoining the international community, to the current status quo.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the elections told us that led in part to this development and this potential breakthrough.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to focus on substantive negotiations to help bring about the policy goal that we seek.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do what I did in the past here, which is move up and down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, on Saturday in the weekly address, said that Washington can sound a lot like Charlie Brown\xe2\x80\x99s teacher -- a lot of unfocused noise can be hard to get past and cut through.\xc2\xa0 And then he talked about the economy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s this huge health care issue right now with the Obamacare website and signup.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the economy, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about immigration.\xc2\xa0 He did the op-ed on ENDA.\xc2\xa0 You spoke about ENDA earlier.\xc2\xa0 What is the focus of the White House right now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as is the case with any White House, we obviously have a lot of issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re addressing at the same time.\xc2\xa0 The principal organizing focus of this White House, as directed by the President, has always been the economy and job creation and middle-class security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is why, even when, by necessity, some issues take more of our attention in public and take more of the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention both in public and in private -- and that includes health care reform, it includes, prior to that, Syria and the debate over what to do about the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime -- every day, the President and his team are pushing forward on economic issues -- on creating a better bargain for the middle class; on trying to find ways that we can work with Congress to increase economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about matters economic in the coming days, because they\xe2\x80\x99re always the first priority when it comes to domestic issues.</p>\n<p>You saw him last week host -- or rather speak to the SelectUSA Summit here, which was a remarkable event, bringing so many participants, and it was over-subscribed, around the idea that this country needs to do what so many other countries do, which is actively engage in the process of soliciting foreign investment to the United States so that jobs are created here -- high-paying, quality middle-class jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And which is not to say that we won\xe2\x80\x99t continue to focus, as we obviously are, on these other issues, but the number-one priority has and will be economic progress.\xc2\xa0 It was the day he was sworn into office when the economy was collapsing here in the United States and around the world, and it is today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when you look at these issues -- and I think this goes to the noise that the President spoke about in his weekly address, and the way that Washington often seems irrelevant to the concerns of the American people and, therefore, can sound like the grownups in Charlie Brown -- what most Americans when these sort of issues break through, of late, what they hear about Washington is that because of a political fight, an ideological fight, they shut down the government and did harm to the economy, reduced job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s got to be enormously frustrating, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that borne out in some of the public data.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe ought to be doing what we can every day to help the economy and help the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you remember, the President went in the Rose Garden on October 21st and talked about troubles with the website and said you can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person, and even said that once you get somebody on the phone, you can -- it usually takes about 25 minutes for an individual to apply, 45 minutes for a family.\xc2\xa0 A new memo released by the Government Reform Committee shows that CMS was talking about how the very same issues were affecting written applications, phone applications.\xc2\xa0 In fact, one of the memos says, at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue because all those applications have to go through the website, have to go through the same computer system.\xc2\xa0 Did the President know that the very same problems would be facing consumers when they called on the phone when he said that they could apply in 25 minutes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, as you know, the answer is, yes, as was reported widely at the time.\xc2\xa0 The whole point is that CMS is processing paper applications through healthcare.gov, but it bypasses the need to create an account.\xc2\xa0 And creating an account is what led to the bulk of issues for users in the initial days.</p>\n<p>Initially, on the launch of the marketplaces on October 1st, you were not able to do that by phone, and in response to the troubles that users were having online -- the unacceptable troubles that they were having, we bulked up the staffing of the call centers and made it possible for individuals to call and enroll, to sign up and bypass, most importantly, the creation of an account so that could be handled by the call-in centers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These applications are then processed through healthcare.gov, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to fix healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the user experience, the whole point was to alleviate the frustration that so many Americans were having online, and to take that frustration away from them and allow a live person at a call-in center to handle their questions and their signups and their enrollment for them.</p>\n<p>So I know this -- I know it\xe2\x80\x99s spoken in tones of dramatic revelation, but it was a known fact at the time.\xc2\xa0 We never pretended otherwise.\xc2\xa0 So I think, as you know because I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to people about this, that this is -- the whole point was to beef up the call-in centers to give the American people who are looking for information a way to avoid some of the frustrations they were having online.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, I want to go back to exactly --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That would be that tone I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to exactly what the President said.\xc2\xa0 He said you can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person, and that it can be done in 25 minutes.\xc2\xa0 But these memos say that at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue because they all have to go through the same portal.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I get it.\xc2\xa0 But the person who calls isn\xe2\x80\x99t the one who continues to wait after the paper application is filled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your mocking me is entertaining, but the President said that you could apply within 25 minutes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was not true.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The work that you do -- I think everybody else is looking quizzically because there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason to be quizzical here.\xc2\xa0 You call up, you give your information, you get the questions answered that you need answered, and then they take over from there.\xc2\xa0 And then you find out what you\'re eligible for and the process goes forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 25 minutes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, once your application is processed.\xc2\xa0 The point was to relieve some of the frustration that Americans were, understandably, experiencing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why does it take 25 minutes?\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could clarify that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If it\'s an individual -- roughly, this is on average -- the interaction you have when you give the information and you bypass the creation of an account and you sign up, so that you didn\'t have to do that online.\xc2\xa0 And then, to enroll, obviously you would be given the information you need.\xc2\xa0 That would be processed and you would find out how much you qualified for and you could be enrolled that way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But obviously -- but, Jon, we have never said that you wouldn\'t -- that the process, the endpoint in the process wouldn\'t still have to go through healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 So this is not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, that\'s not true, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Look at your own words.\xc2\xa0 On October 21st, the same day, you said you can enroll over the phone, you can enroll in person.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On October 23rd, you said there are four ways to enroll in the exchanges.\xc2\xa0 You didn\'t say they all had to go through healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 You said there are four ways to enroll in the exchanges -- by phone, in person --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, you don\'t have to go through healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- at local health centers, or by mail, or the website.\xc2\xa0 You said there were four different ways.\xc2\xa0 There\'s only one way.\xc2\xa0 It all has to go through, as you just said, healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying what I said and what everybody said -- and, again, you can have this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got your quotes here.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- soliloquy by yourself, but the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m trying to understand why the President gave the American public the impression that they could imply -- they could apply -- not impression, told people they could apply in 25 minutes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They can get on the phone and call.\xc2\xa0 And the paperwork is filled out for them and the process is taken over from there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when do they enroll?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When their paperwork is processed through healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 But they don\'t have to go online to do it is the point, Jon.\xc2\xa0 That was the whole purpose of while we are fixing the website, making it meet the standards that we set, that Americans could have this alternative way with beefed up staffing and new rules allowing the call-in centers to do this, the individuals on the call-in centers to do this, to provide that relief to Americans who are frustrated by the experience.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m not sure what you think you\'ve discovered here, Jon, but, I mean, if you\'re asking me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you being accurate when --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President is saying you can bypass the website? Because you just that it all has to go through the website.\xc2\xa0 So which is it?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think we\'ve been through this.\xc2\xa0 You call, you have an experience with -- you have a conversation with somebody in the call-in center.\xc2\xa0 You give them your information. They process it for you.\xc2\xa0 They bypass the creation of an account, which is where most of the bottlenecks were happening for users on the website.\xc2\xa0 Eventually, that still has to go through healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve done the work with --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- do the \xe2\x80\x9ceventually\xe2\x80\x9d part.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I give up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- one more thing.\xc2\xa0 From Kathleen Sebelius -- tell me if this was accurate.\xc2\xa0 This was October 24th.\xc2\xa0 She said, out of the Phoenix call center, a person on the other end of the phone can get questions answered up to 150 languages, as well as walk somebody all the way through the process and enroll at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, at the end of the day.\xc2\xa0 You give somebody your information -- when you call up and sign up for something right now, Jon, and somebody takes your information and they process that, they process whatever it is you\'re signing up for and enrolling in, they can do that once you\xe2\x80\x99re off the phone. You don\'t have to stay on the phone.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the point, is to relieve Americans who were frustrated by the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said you can enroll by the end of the day.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0 You can call somebody up and enroll --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think everybody else here understands what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I can\'t say the same for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that there are enrollment issues and people are having trouble enrolling in Obamacare, buying insurance, whatever, what about all of these folks who are losing their insurance currently because they\'re getting letters of cancellation notices from insurers?\xc2\xa0 Are all of those people going to be able to obtain insurance in time to avoid the fines and the penalties and so forth?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re so hard at work on making the website function.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we expanded the means by which you can get the information you need and bypass the creation of an account and enroll.</p>\n<p>As you know, the people that you\'re talking about are -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important every time you report this for your viewers that they understand the universe -- 80 percent of us across the country, 80 percent of the population receives insurance coverage through their employer or through Medicare, Medicaid or the VA.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen percent of us, of the remaining 20 percent, are uninsured.\xc2\xa0 And for the first time those 15 percent who fall through the cracks in the current insurance system that we have in this country have access to quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Five percent -- the remaining 5 percent currently purchase insurance on the individual market.\xc2\xa0 A portion of that 5 percent -- so not even the 5 percent -- because they are not grandfathered in because the policy that they currently have is not the policy they had when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law are being told by insurers that they have to get new insurance policies that meet the minimum standards of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>And for them, there will be an abundance of options through the marketplaces -- a greater abundance in almost all cases than exists today -- and there will be the opportunity for many of them, more than half of them, to get tax credits to reduce the cost of insurance.\xc2\xa0 Without question, by definition, they will be getting better insurance than they currently have because the insurance they currently have doesn\'t meet basic standards that the President believes and those who support the Affordable Care Act and passed it into law believe are necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But clearly, an unanticipated number of Americans -- perhaps millions of Americans -- may be experiencing these glitches, these technical problems, what have you, in enrolling for at least the next several weeks -- who knows how long, right? I mean, that is something that has been occurring.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that we believe that the website healthcare.gov will function effectively for the vast majority of Americans by the end of this month.\xc2\xa0 And there are teams hard at work on making that happen, and they are making incremental progress towards that end every day.\xc2\xa0 And while the site is not by any means without challenges or glitches today, it is better today than it was in early October, and it gets better virtually every day as these fixes are made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this is important work.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the fact that the website had performed so poorly initially that Americans who tried to use it were often frustrated by it, and we are behind in getting the kind of information that we need to get to the American people and getting them signed up and enrolled, which makes it all the more important for us to make the website function effectively, make sure that these other means are available to Americans to get the information they need so they can sign up and enroll.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why it was important to have, or it is good to have a six-month enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 Because as we noted last week when the President visited Massachusetts, in the closest existing example of a program like this, a very similar program that was launched in Massachusetts, you had a dynamic where enrollment was very slow, initially -- only 123 people in the first month in Massachusetts -- and then built up steadily over the course of time.\xc2\xa0 That 123 I think represented .3 percent of what would be the overall enrollment by the end of the enrollment period.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on ENDA, is the President challenging the Speaker to call for a vote?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is calling on the House to take up the legislation and to pass it.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not laying down a challenge.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously disappointed when any lawmaker announces that he or she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support extraordinarily fair, basic protections for LGBT Americans -- protections that other Americans enjoy and they should enjoy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to passage in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re heartened by the developments in the Senate that have brought us this far and believe that the momentum behind equal rights is such that we will prevail as a country on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly, in that book that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out, \xe2\x80\x9cDouble Down\xe2\x80\x9d -- apparently it\xe2\x80\x99s already out for some people --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your copy?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not yet, no.\xc2\xa0 The President attended a super PAC fundraiser, according to reports on what is in this book, the President attended a super PAC fundraiser last year.\xc2\xa0 Did he, indeed, do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the revelation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was quite a bit of reporting this weekend about internal conversations here at the White House about implementing the health care law.\xc2\xa0 David Cutler produced a memo for the economic team back in May of 2010 in which he raised several flags.\xc2\xa0 And he was someone who wanted the law to work well, he was someone that the White House trusted as an outside consultant on health care.\xc2\xa0 And he identified several problems that he thought were beginning to build and that should receive more White House attention than they were at the time, or that he says now, did subsequently.\xc2\xa0 Was there a lack of a singular leadership focus within the White House on pulling together all the vast array of implementation issues that would come with this law?\xc2\xa0 And looking back on it, does the President regret not having someone singularly focused on that task?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there were senior people focused on passage of and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about that.\xc2\xa0 If the question is, do we wish the website was working more effectively and, thus, that more had been done to make sure that it would work effectively come October 1st, the answer is, unquestionably, yes.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we own that.\xc2\xa0 We acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 And nobody is more frustrated by it than the President.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, on his orders, there are teams working around the clock to improve that experience for millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to the overall suggestion I think of the article you mentioned or the memo you mentioned, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that so much of the Affordable Care Act was implemented over the last several years, including provisions that allow parents to keep their kids on their coverage, including banning discrimination against kids with preexisting conditions, including banning lifetime limits on coverage, including requiring insurers to spend at least 80 percent of their premiums on health care, and then setting up those transitional, high-risk pools for people with preexisting conditions to get quality, affordable health insurance before the marketplaces made it the law of the land that they could not be denied coverage.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of implementation took place in the three-plus years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the opening of the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that when it comes to the launching of the website that more should have been done in order to ensure that it would function effectively.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But so from your answer I take that everything else is working just fine, everything else is as the President envisioned; all the consumer reaction that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting about what they\xe2\x80\x99re being told from their insurance companies, all that\xe2\x80\x99s fine; the biggest problem is the website -- the only problem is the website.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously this is a big piece of business and there are issues that have to be resolved, as has been the case since the law passed.\xc2\xa0 The website is an important factor and one that is a problem, and we continue to address head on and accept responsibility for directly because we know it needs to work.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked as effectively as it needs to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important, too, to note that even during this period, there has been -- the marketplaces have been stood up people have been able to get the information they need; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to window shop; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to -- in insufficient numbers because of the difficulties -- they have been able to sign up, register, and enroll.\xc2\xa0 And that process will continue and the pace will increase.</p>\n<p>But there are obviously -- I guess you need to ask me more specifically because I would never say that everything is running perfectly --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- CMS is not the perfect place to be the sort of lead agency either on the website or some of the other technical aspects of implementing the health care law.\xc2\xa0 He was advising and recommending, because he was a friend and wanted this to succeed, that there be someone with the political clout and the policy chops here at the White House to not only oversee CMS but HHS and this vast array of other agencies, some of which he said were either underfunded or undermanned or demoralized or other issues. Do you think that was a valid point then, and in retrospect, is an even more valid point now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that to the extent that it reflects what is our dissatisfaction with the functioning of the website, that is an interesting observation.\xc2\xa0 Whether specific measures like that would have made it function more effectively on time, it\'s hard for me to say, not being a management expert or a website creation expert.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no question that nobody is satisfied, and that includes at CMS and HHS, as well as the White House, with the way the website has functioned.</p>\n<p>I think the broader points I made about the things that have worked are important, and the things that have been implemented. But there is more work to be done here and we\'re focused on getting that work done -- because the goal remains ensuring that there are marketplaces up there stood up that are working effectively so that millions of Americans can get access to quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you also know, there was a good deal of conversation this weekend as to whether or not the President and everyone echoing his remarks should use the particular phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cif you like your plan, you can keep it\xe2\x80\x9d -- that it was too declarative; that in the end, it might not be something that the American people would consider believable in retrospect, meaning there would be shifts in the insurance market that everyone could project and that some might feel this was promising too much.\xc2\xa0 To the degree that you\'re -- I know you\'re capable -- to the degree you\'re willing, share with us how great a point of debate this was and if there are any regrets about using that phraseology and giving that level of ironclad commitment to people who now wonder if it was something they could take to the bank?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just -- a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, it was not a point of debate that I remember or participated in. But, secondly, the premise -- I mean, the question is based on reporting that suggests that policy people didn\'t want this and political people did.\xc2\xa0 And I can just point you to a White House health care policy advisor on staff here at the time, Zeke Emanuel, who pointed out that the statement was aimed to convey that because insurers could continue offering plans, even those deemed to be substandard, if they were in existence at the time the law was passed, you could keep your plan.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President said.\xc2\xa0 And as Zeke Emanuel said, and I quote, "Any plan that existed before the date the law passed would be grandfathered in, unless lots of changes were made."</p>\n<p>Now, I mean, if the President -- as I think my colleague Dan Pfeiffer said over the weekend, if the President didn\'t intend to keep that promise, why would he have gone out of his way to make sure that there was a provision in the law designed to keep the promise, which was the grandfathering-in clause.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Until policies changed, which many health care advisors here said, and it\'s part of the debate, apparently -- those policies are going to change.\xc2\xa0 Because, I mean, to suggest otherwise would have been -- to have people here working at the White House saying the President -- these policies are never going to change, that grandfather thing is always going to be good.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re supposing debates that, again, I\'m not sure took place.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that what is the case is that the slice of a slice of the population that we\'re talking about that gets their policy coverage through the individual market deals with the upheavals in that market all the time, even more so than the rest of us.\xc2\xa0 And what happened when we\'re talking about those cancellation notices or the transition notices is that the people who have gotten those letters did not have -- the policy they have today, even if they had insurance coverage three years ago, is not what they had three years ago.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Because their insurer downgraded their plan and they had no recourse, or their insurer changed other significant elements of their plan probably while they jacked up the prices significantly.</p>\n<p>So I understand the communications issue here, and it\'s why we\'ve discussed it so frequently.\xc2\xa0 But as a matter of fact, the law and the provision within it could not grandfather in plans that did not exist and people associated with them that did not exist.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So our focus has to be, when we\'re talking about that slice of the 5 percent of the population affected by this, is to make sure that they get the information they need to make choices about their insurance coverage from options and an array of options they probably never had before; that they find out whether they qualify for tax credits.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'ll find at the end of the day is that a majority of those folks will get better coverage at the same or less cost than they have today.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s important.\xc2\xa0 That is delivering on one of the promises of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to -- we have the website to deal with. We have a number of issues with implementation to deal with.\xc2\xa0 Our focus here is not on Monday-morning quarterbacking and who said what in what meeting, but what we can do today to ensure that millions of Americans are getting the kinds of benefits that the law promises, in addition to the millions of Americans who are already enjoying the benefits that the law has delivered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, on that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move around as I promised.\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In defense of press freedom --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you Dan?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Goodness.\xc2\xa0 Okay, you can go first and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the other one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 A question related to the NSA.\xc2\xa0 In defense of press freedoms around the world, the administration is very critical of countries that use counterterrorism legislation to muzzle journalists -- Burundi, Egypt, Morocco, Turkey all recent examples.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, this weekend it became clear that the British police have used counterterrorism legislation to go after the NSA story, in particular during the arrest of Dave Miranda, Glen Greenwald\xe2\x80\x99s partner.\xc2\xa0 Would the administration apply similar criticism there to the use of counterterrorism legislation to muzzle journalists?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that over the weekend so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p>Dan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Thanks for circling back.\xc2\xa0 I wonder about the apparent drone attack that killed Mehsud in Pakistan, which the Pakistani government has denounced, has produced calls from some politicians there to stop the transfer of equipment and things to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and so soon after the Pakistani leader had talks here.\xc2\xa0 Is there concern about the damage that might cause to this kind of relationship that was so much a focus in those talks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The President and the Prime Minister had very good meetings, and they reflected the strong, ongoing dialogue that we are having with Pakistan regarding all aspects of our bilateral relationship and our shared interests.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said at the time, despite the fact that there inevitably will be some tensions and occasional misunderstandings between our two countries, we continue to hope -- rather we hope to continue to make progress in the relationship, and we continue to seek ways for our countries to cooperate on the entire range of shared interests that we have from economic to security issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The report that you mentioned -- or the reports that you mention are not ones that I can confirm.\xc2\xa0 But I think I can be clear that Hakimullah Mehsud was considered the commander of the TTP -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the Pakistan Taliban -- the group that claimed responsibility for the failed bombing in Times Square in New York City in May of 2010.\xc2\xa0 Hakimullah and other TTP leaders had publicly vowed to continue targeting the United States and Americans.\xc2\xa0 Mehsud was also wanted in connection with his involvement in the murder of seven and injury of six Americans citizens on December 30th, 2009, at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost Province, Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Mehsud had been indicted on charges of conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens abroad and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction against U.S. citizens abroad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition, the TTP has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 It has a close relationship with al Qaeda and has conducted numerous terrorist attacks, as you know, in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, as I said, around all of these issues we have a broad dialogue with Pakistan, and the meeting that the Prime Minister and President had here reflects that.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have tensions in our relationship, and we work through them because we have so many important shared bilateral interests, and those are economic and security related.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s in both nations\xe2\x80\x99 interests, we believe, to strengthen the relationship between our two countries, which is what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.</p>\n<p>Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At a press conference in Saudi Arabia today, Prince Saud said that he and Secretary of State Kerry are both committed to the Geneva peace conference on Syria and that Assad should not be part of any transition afterwards.\xc2\xa0 But the thing is that Assad has made it very clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to talk to the armed opposition, and the moderate opposition has said that they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to talk to the government at this point.\xc2\xa0 And furthermore, the Islamist militants are on the outskirts of Damascus and have taken over the lead in terms of dominance from the moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-part question.\xc2\xa0 The first part is, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the Islamist militants be at the table, seeing as they are the opposition who are really dominant at this point and are going to have to play some kind of role in a post-Assad Syria?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, what makes you think that a Syrian peace conference in Geneva stands any chance of even happening?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the question, first of all, and I think I can say on behalf of all of us, reminding us that Syria remains an important story.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We remain committed to the target of November for Geneva II. We continue to consult closely with Joint Special Representative Brahimi, with the Russians, the London 11, and the Syrian Opposition Coalition to advance momentum towards convening a Geneva II conference as soon as it is practical to do so.</p>\n<p>As you know, Mr. Brahimi is in the region and he will convene a trilateral meeting tomorrow with the U.S. and Russian officials in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. delegation, in case you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, will be led by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, and it will include U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford and Counselor for the National Security Advisor Salman Ahmed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we are committed to doing everything we can to bring an inclusive and cohesive opposition delegation to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 We continue to consult closely with the Syrian coalition leadership to help it strengthen and coalesce further, and ensure that its Geneva II delegation will be properly representative and inclusive.\xc2\xa0 Participation by a representative body of the moderate opposition at a Geneva conference is not only essential to moving forward toward a political transition, but to the future of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we remain committed to this process in spite of the obstacles that you raise because political reconciliation, a political negotiated solution is the only way out of the bloodshed in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It is our firm belief that Assad cannot be a part of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 He long ago relinquished that opportunity because of the actions he took and the amount of his own people\xe2\x80\x99s blood he has spilled.</p>\n<p>It is true that because the conflict has been going on for so long, that there are different elements of the opposition, some of them moderate, some of them extremist.\xc2\xa0 And while extremist elements may have more fighting strength, we do not believe that they represent or need to represent the future of Syria.\xc2\xa0 They certainly should not.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked very closely with the Syrian Opposition Coalition and all moderates in Syria to try to assist them in unifying and in representing the interests of the Syrian people at Geneva and elsewhere as they try to forge a better future for Syria.</p>\n<p>So we remain committed to the Geneva II conference.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it can happen in November.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the case that the challenges that you cite are real, and the fact of that is just a reminder that we need to press on Geneva as a way to resolve this bloodshed in Syria, because otherwise the alternative is so dire indeed for the Syrian people and for the region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other issue you\xe2\x80\x99re facing is that President Assad is indicating that he wishes to run for reelection and has no intention of stepping down.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I can tell you is that the Syrian people have no interest in having Bashar al Assad remain in charge of their country.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not in charge of their country today, at least not in whole.\xc2\xa0 And the idea that the Syrian people, in a free vote, would choose and elect a man who has brutally murdered them with impunity I think is not serious at all.</p>\n<p>Yes, Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the website question, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said again and again, including today, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out, we own that, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So on the question of why the President said \xe2\x80\x9cif you like your plan, you can keep it,\xe2\x80\x9d why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do something similar?\xc2\xa0 Why not just say it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely right, and move on, which is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to do with the website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President addressed this in Boston. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the notice that it might have.\xc2\xa0 But the President talked about this issue of cancellations, talked about the facts behind the grandfathering clause within the Affordable Care Act, and talked about the reality that we need to make sure that that portion of the 5 percent of the population that is affected by this because their insurance plans have changed their coverage, downgraded their coverage in the last few years, is provided all the information it needs and all the information it can get about potential subsidies so that they will have affordable, quality -- better quality -- health insurance coverage come January 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree before when Major was asking you that there was even a debate here in the White House about whether the President should say it or not.\xc2\xa0 Robert Gibbs, your predecessor, was on TV this morning and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9cdebate,\xe2\x80\x9d but he said the verbiage the President used -- that there was not 100 percent agreement among the White House staff on whether it was the right verbiage to use.\xc2\xa0 And then he was pressed on whether it was the wrong move for him to go forward anyway, the President, and Gibbs said \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d certainly it was.</p>\n<p>So my question is -- instead, you seem to be saying it\xe2\x80\x99s the insurance industry\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re kicking people off.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re sending out cancellation letters.\xc2\xa0 When Dan Pfeiffer said yesterday -- you referenced this \xe2\x80\x93 he said if you had a plan before the Affordable Care Act passed and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been changed or cancelled, you can keep it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been changed or cancelled, you can keep it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s being changed and cancelled --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously.\xc2\xa0 I like that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously.\xc2\xa0 So -- but the insurance companies say they\xe2\x80\x99re making these changes because they\xe2\x80\x99re being forced by the new law, not doing it on their own --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I\'m seeing some heads shaking here because that represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said again and again you have new requirements for the insurance companies to include all of these different things in the policies that were not included before.\xc2\xa0 So to comply with that, they\xe2\x80\x99re sending out cancellation notices.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But wait, no, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The reason why these individuals have gotten notices is because, if they had insurance at all on the individual market when the law was passed, which was the only universe we could address at the time because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know -- we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t transport ourselves into the future -- but is because their insurers cancelled their plans and reissued them new ones, almost invariably downgraded plans in the interim.\xc2\xa0 So the fact is there\xe2\x80\x99s a provision in the law for a reason that grandfathers those plans and the people attached to them if they want to stay with them from prior to the passage of the law going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if the insurance company changed the plan in the interim by reducing coverage, then it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get grandfather status any more than a new plan introduced a year ago that was substandard and had caps or prevented you from getting benefits in hospitalization or anything like that would meet the minimum standards of coverage that the Affordable Care Act provides.</p>\n<p>If you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this, obviously, because we need to do a better job of getting the facts out to that universe of the American population that is looking for answers.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do that, because our goal is the fulfillment of the policy objective, which is the provision of quality and affordable health insurance to every American or at least to provide access to every American.</p>\n<p>So, again, the provision in the law I think reflects what was the -- that was the purpose of the grandfather-in clause.\xc2\xa0 And as I think Dan said over the weekend, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to keep his promise, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone out of his way to ensure that the grandfather-in clause was there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We understand we have to get the information that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary that these people need because they deserve it and they need to know what their options are; they need to know that the majority of them will qualify for tax credits that will reduce the price of their new coverage; they need to know that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting better coverage than they had in the past and that they have more options.</p>\n<p>One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly happening is that people are getting letters from their current insurance company that say, your current plan will expire, and then they\xe2\x80\x99re getting information about that company\xe2\x80\x99s offerings, sometimes directing them to sign up for that company\xe2\x80\x99s offerings, and that company may no longer -- because of the competitive nature of the markets in many places -- may no longer be offering the best deal.\xc2\xa0 So every person who\xe2\x80\x99s out there who might get a letter like that needs to go get the information that\xe2\x80\x99s available to them to find out what their options are, because they are better than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in almost all cases.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to make sure I understand this very clearly, when the President spoke in the Rose Garden, and again more recently, when he was in Boston, telling people they could circumvent the website by paper applications or by phone applications -- does everybody who wants to enroll have to go through healthcare.gov in some form?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, as I was saying to Jon, when the marketplaces launched on October 1st, there were call-in centers. Operators on those call-in centers could not, at that time -- they could answer your questions about a lot of the issues around the Affordable Care Act, but at that time, they would still direct callers to the websites themselves to create an account and go through the process.</p>\n<p>Because of the troubles with the website, HHS and CMS beefed up the staffing at the call-in centers and made it possible for those who are operating the phones to take information from callers so that they could bypass the need to create an account and get right to the registration and enrollment process.</p>\n<p>On the back end, those enrollments still have to go through healthcare.gov, which HHS and everybody said at the time.\xc2\xa0 But the individual doesn\'t do that.\xc2\xa0 They do the work with the call-in center, and at the back end that information is fed through healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to be clear, is it faster -- if I right now were to call in to one of these individuals and speak to them, would I be expedited through the system and be able to enroll in a way that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t through healthcare.gov?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would take a lot less of your time, potentially, if -- I mean there are plenty -- there are a lot of Americans who are getting through healthcare.gov now successfully.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously hard to say.\xc2\xa0 It depends on when you go on, whether you encounter problems with the website.</p>\n<p>What is the case is that you may spend less time at a call-in -- which was the whole purpose -- than you would online if you\'re experiencing frustrations online.\xc2\xa0 And if you enroll today or a week from now, you only get insurance on January 1st -- or a month from now, or five weeks now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the whole point, again, was -- the purpose of beefing up the staffing at the call-in centers and making the point that the President and others made was to give Americans frustrated by the healthcare.gov experience another way to get information, another way to sign up.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what it did.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it didn\'t help you sign up.\xc2\xa0 It only helped you -- it only helped you enroll your information.\xc2\xa0 I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re asking this right now because a lot of the information still getting to the insurers still has problems.\xc2\xa0 I asked you on October 23rd if it was fair to send people elsewhere, if that would help them expedite the problem, when the website, the computer system was still broken, and it appears that you guys said, yes, you should go elsewhere, that will help get it done quicker.\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\'t because the website is still broken.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They handle the paperwork for you.\xc2\xa0 What needs to happen in time for people to get insurance on January 1st is for those individuals to be successfully enrolled before the deadline.\xc2\xa0 There is still time to do that.\xc2\xa0 The point of setting up the call-in centers was to alleviate some of the frustration people were feeling with the website, understandable frustration.</p>\n<p>And we can talk in circles about this, Peter, but whether it\'s online or by phone or in person or by mail, if you enrolled on October 1st or November 1st or November 4th, or December 1st, you get your insurance January 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point is words matter right now, and there\'s a sense among some people, because of these new memos that have come out --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Clarity in reporting matters, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'re trying to clarify with you.\xc2\xa0 So the point is right now there\'s some belief system that the President has oversold again with the comments he recently made about ways that people can apply and is under-delivering, and that going to the website, by changing the website --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I\'ve addressed this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did he oversell?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, I\'ve addressed the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fine.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you a separate one.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There were reports at the time about the fact that healthcare.gov was still the funnel through which ultimate enrollment would happen.\xc2\xa0 But the point of the call-in centers was to reduce the frustration that individuals were having.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he said.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we were doing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 And in the meantime, we\'re busting rocks every day to fix the website so that it\'s up and running at a standard that\'s acceptable for the vast majority of Americans by the end of the month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not follow what many Democrats, including Dianne Feinstein, have said, and shut the website down for a period of one month?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll still have all the time you need to enroll by January 1st and get it done.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got this question earlier -- because people are enrolling every day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But information is still incorrectly arriving at insurers.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And that situation is improving every day with the fixes that we\'re making.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, the endpoint here has to be -- we accept it -- has to be that the whole system works, that people from point to point, from their first creation of an account to the enrollment with an insurance plan, works.\xc2\xa0 And we have had trouble with various points along that road through the website.\xc2\xa0 And there are teams working with each problem to make sure they\'re fixed -- isolated and fixed through the various ways that they can do that -- through patches or increasing server capacity or rewriting code. All that work is happening.</p>\n<p>In the end -- and it\'s a lot of work, but we believe it can get done.\xc2\xa0 In the end, we need to make sure that Americans who seek quality, affordable health insurance on the marketplaces are getting the information they need, and if they choose to, they can enroll and get the tax subsidies that they qualify for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A document being referred to earlier that was sent out exactly three and a half years ago, just two months after the law was signed by the President, from this outside health advisor said, "I\'m concerned that the personnel and processes are not up to the task that health reform will be unsuccessful as a result." Now as you look back on that, given the fact that David Cutler, this outside advisor, says that there was no one in the system who had ever run a business, let alone ever been in charge of a startup -- and this would be the biggest startup in the world -- was this a fail of leadership, a failure of -- I\'ll pose it again.\xc2\xa0 Was this a failure of leadership by the President not to put someone in charge of this who had experience on something of this sort?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that when it comes to the website, we completely acknowledge and accept responsibility for the fact that it\'s not functioning properly.\xc2\xa0 That is the significant challenge that we have faced since October 1st.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the team in place was able to do, and continues to be able to do, all the things that I\'ve mentioned, which is implement a law that allows parents to keep their children on their policies until 26; that created a way for those with preexisting conditions to be covered during a transition period.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Jeffrey Zients ends in two months.\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, is the White House focused right now on finding someone who has that experience to be in charge on day one, January 1st, going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no personnel announcements to make.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, the White House just announced that Vice President Biden is traveling to China, Japan and South Korea.\xc2\xa0 Why this timing?\xc2\xa0 And what issue will be at the top of the agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, for more details about that trip, since it was just announced, I\'d refer you to the Vice President\'s office.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President travels frequently on behalf of the President and the administration.\xc2\xa0 He obviously has a great deal of experience in foreign affairs and a great many relationships around the world, including in Asia.\xc2\xa0 Asia is a focal point of this administration\'s foreign policy, the pivot that we\'ve discussed frequently.\xc2\xa0 And the Vice President\'s trip will be in keeping with the intense focus the President has brought to bear on our relationships in the region and on our presence in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this will be a continuation of the work that the President has done, that the Vice President has done in previous trips to Asia.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that the President looks forward to speaking with Vice President Biden specifically about the trip before he goes and then getting a readout upon his return.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second question is that according to a news report, NSA has several monitoring posts in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong that raise a big concern in China.\xc2\xa0 So will this be an issue between the Vice President and his counterpart in China?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, I don\'t comment on specific, reported intelligence-gathering activities.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m confident of is that when the Vice President travels and has meetings with counterparts in foreign countries that every topic is on the table.</p>\n<p>Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the question about the super PAC -- I know you said you\xe2\x80\x99d get back to us on the answer to that -- is the President ruling out fundraising for any Democratic super PACs for the coming cycle?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just promise that in November of 2013, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a single conversation about 2014.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge you and get back to you to the extent we have answers on these questions, but I can assure you that we won\xe2\x80\x99t be spending a lot of time on them in the near future.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another health care question -- since you probably --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want to know about paperwork?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration has made a big deal lately about the idea that half of all uninsured single young adults can get policies on the insurance exchanges for under $50 a month.\xc2\xa0 Now, these policies, as it turns out, typically have deductibles of $5,000 or more once you get your free checkup.\xc2\xa0 How does that square with the promise of affordable health care -- not just affordable insurance, but affordable health care?\xc2\xa0 And to qualify for these plans, you typically have to be making like $24,000 a year or less to get that rate.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, every individual who might apply for or enroll in insurance on the individual market has available to him subsidies and also a vast array of choices.\xc2\xa0 The basic level of insurance might have a higher deductible; a higher-level insurance might have a lower deductible, as is true today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that this question is about a group of potentially insured individuals who tend to go without insurance because they\xe2\x80\x99re young and don\xe2\x80\x99t believe they need it because they think they\xe2\x80\x99re invincible and they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to afford it.\xc2\xa0 So when they do, if they go on the individual market, they tend to purchase only catastrophic plans with low premiums and high deductibles, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t get the kind of basic coverage that will be provided because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And they certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t get the subsidies that will be provided because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question -- and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s really good data on this that kind of pushes against the common belief that most young people really aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in purchasing insurance.\xc2\xa0 Most of them say they are.\xc2\xa0 Actually, a significant majority say they are, according to public surveys, provided that it is affordable.\xc2\xa0 And what will be true for that group is what\xe2\x80\x99s true for all groups on this market, which represents a fairly small portion of the population, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have far greater choices in front of them, including differing price ranges and different coverage levels than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before.</p>\n<p>Nakamura, then Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I know you talked about the President will talk about health care tonight at the OFA remarks.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see that -- I mean, OFA is a group that has been pushing for his agenda in concert with the White House, and on immigration and gun control, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a lot of actions or results in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And now with the problems with the health care website, I mean, does the President view this chance to talk to folks at OFA as sort of a pep talk and sort of for anybody who might feel a bit burned out or frustrated about this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the folks he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking to tonight are committed to an agenda that, when it comes to health care, is designed to provide affordable, quality health insurance to millions of Americans who haven\xe2\x80\x99t had access to it in the past, and to provide the kind of benefits that we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing and have seen over the years to every American when it comes to health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that this audience will be excited to hear that message and is very focused on the implementation of this policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he fear that the people up in the frontlines\xc2\xa0 -- he\xe2\x80\x99s also meeting in Dallas on Wednesday with frontline workers on sort of health care, getting that message out -- I mean, does he fear that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t see results that those fighting on his behalf on his agenda will feel, again, burned out or frustrated, or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that this is always hard work, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see results.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing results, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see better results as time goes on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember -- because we sort of focus on the post-legislative period after the law actually passed Congress and was signed into law, and then after it was upheld by the Supreme Court -- that that achievement alone took 100 years of trying by Presidents of both parties and Congresses with leaders from both parties.\xc2\xa0 It stands to reason that the implementation was going to be challenging, and made more challenging by the fact that we faced so much political opposition even in the wake of winning the legislative battle and winning the judicial battle and winning the electoral battle, because the American people want quality and affordable health insurance -- but there\xe2\x80\x99s still an effort to undermine it underway.\xc2\xa0 There are still promises to defund it or repeal it, and every time without a credible alternative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So every time a lawmaker says that\xe2\x80\x99s his or her goal, they ought to be reminded -- or the story ought to remind readers or viewers that the world they\xe2\x80\x99re envisioning is one where insurance companies can take away your coverage, or put fine print in it that means that the very illness you suffer from won\xe2\x80\x99t be covered by your plan, or just deny you coverage outright.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of forces working against this and always have been.\xc2\xa0 There are entrenched interests.\xc2\xa0 But in the end, we are where we are because Americans felt that it was the right thing to do to make sure that health care was a right and not a privilege.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he asking them to do anything tonight?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to ask them to do --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview the remarks more than I already have.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related then, I was going to ask you why he is going to Dallas on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Is it because -- is that a way inadvertently to showcase the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we put out -- or we should have put out a little more information about that trip.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with and thank local volunteers who are helping consumers learn about and enroll in quality, affordable health insurance plans through the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, Dallas is one of the 10 cities with the highest rates of uninsured residents that participate in the federal marketplace, and Dallas has one of the most active groups in the community working on enrollment and outreach efforts.\xc2\xa0 So the President looks forward to meeting with these folks who are playing such an important role in the outreach effort to make sure that Americans who are uninsured get the insurance that\xe2\x80\x99s available to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There was a piece I think in your paper this morning that talked about the number of Americans who have been boxed out of getting insurance for so many years who will now, under the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, get health insurance coverage for the first time, and many of them at either very low cost or no cost because of their financial situation.</p>\n<p>So this is important work.\xc2\xa0 And what the President focuses on is the endpoint of the effort, which is delivering the benefits to the Americans who need them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he draw attention -- is this his way of going to a place where the state is not participating in the exchanges, it\xe2\x80\x99s leaving that to the federal government, and is not expanding Medicaid to those people who would newly qualify?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not the President will address those issues in his remarks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case that, especially with the expansion of Medicaid, that that is a decision that governors have made in some states that is depriving their constituents of health insurance that they would otherwise qualify for, with enormously helpful subsidies from the federal government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of Republican governors who are conservatives who have acknowledged that this is the right thing to do for the residents of their states.\xc2\xa0 And we appreciate the decisions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made on behalf of their constituents.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with statehouses and governors across the country on this issue because we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the fulfillment of the goal here of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 Could you say how the President is getting his information, being briefed on the fixes to the program?\xc2\xa0 And is it daily?\xc2\xa0 How is it occurring?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s briefing him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he does get briefed regularly.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have how --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But specifically, on healthcare.gov and Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does, yes, as has been the case prior to the -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no stepped up --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- regularity of it.\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say since we\xe2\x80\x99ve had these troubles that he\xe2\x80\x99s probably getting more updates than he otherwise would have.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the how frequent it is or if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily on the same pattern every week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said \xe2\x80\x9cprobably.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is he getting more?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t prove a counterfactual.\xc2\xa0 So had the website not experienced the troubles it had, so he would have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, getting more than before the news came up.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it came up pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we knew -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to quantify.\xc2\xa0 The answer is, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s being updated regularly and he is very focused on ensuring that fixes are made to the website and that implementation continues apace, because there\xe2\x80\x99s an end goal here that matters to real people and isn\xe2\x80\x99t about who\xe2\x80\x99s up and who\xe2\x80\x99s down in Washington, politically, but who\xe2\x80\x99s going to have the kind of security that comes with knowing you\xe2\x80\x99re covered across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that security is vital for millions of Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t have it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on Dallas, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Will the President make any tribute or reference to President Kennedy while there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have another preview -- any more of a preview for his remarks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:17 P.M.
