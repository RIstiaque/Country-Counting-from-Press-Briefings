Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p1">1:18 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have something at the top here.\xc2\xa0 As I think some of you, or most of you saw, on Thursday, May 29, President Obama will host a summit at the White House on youth sports safety and concussions, where he will be joined by stakeholders, including young athletes, parents, coaches, experts, professional athletes, and military servicemembers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the White House Healthy Kids and Safe Sports Concussion Summit, the President will announce new commitments by both the public and private sectors to raise awareness about how to identify, treat and prevent concussions, and conduct additional research in the field of sports-related concussions that will help us better address these problems.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As both a parent and an avid sports fan, the President appreciates the role that sports play in the lives of young people.\xc2\xa0 And this administration is committed to helping ensure that children continue to be active and play sports safely.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On immigration, Valerie Jarrett was quoted in Las Vegas as saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a window between now and August to get immigration overhaul done.\xc2\xa0 And she says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a commitment from Speaker Boehner, who\xe2\x80\x99s very frustrated with his caucus.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now, the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office has denied that there\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment.\xc2\xa0 And in a tweet today, Valerie herself said that this was lost in translation and that she actually meant that it was a commitment to trying.\xc2\xa0 But I guess the question is -- a commitment to trying what and when?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner, other House Republican leaders and leading Republicans outside of the House of Representatives have all expressed deep interest in moving forward on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And we have found those comments and that interest to be encouraging and indicative of some movement among Republicans in the House towards support for comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What the President has said and others have said is that the opportunity before us is something very rare and we ought to seize it here in Washington, all of us.\xc2\xa0 The House ought to follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 In the Senate, a comprehensive bill passed with Democratic and Republican support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Republicans across the country, business leaders across the country, faith leaders and law enforcement leaders across the country are behind this effort.\xc2\xa0 They recognize that passing comprehensive immigration reform will provide a huge boost to our economy, to our security, to principles of fairness.\xc2\xa0 And for those reasons we ought to move forward, and what we hope is that the House will move.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a message that Valerie was carrying and that we have all been carrying for some time now.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the suggestion here that if doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen by August, or at the end of August -- have an August recess -- that the President will take matters into his own hands, he has some authority to do some things -- that we do something beyond just tweaking the margins?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about the future.\xc2\xa0 What we have always said will always remain true, which is comprehensive immigration reform requires action by Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President is always interested in moving the ball forward on his agenda where he can, even if Congress refuses to act.\xc2\xa0 But there are some things that require congressional action, and this is one of them.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the Senate acted in this Congress, and has put a bill forward that enjoys broad bipartisan support across the country in communities and among interest groups that don\xe2\x80\x99t often get together behind the same priority.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor, Chairman Ryan and others hear all the voices of support, including traditional Republican voices, traditional conservative voices for comprehensive immigration reform and move forward with it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Valerie was talking about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has talked about and I have talked about and others.</p>\n<p class="p2">We should get this done for our economy.\xc2\xa0 We should get this done for our security.\xc2\xa0 We should get this done because it will allow us to innovate more here in this country in ways that will build our economy and create high-paying jobs in this country.\xc2\xa0 So the opportunity is there for the taking, and we hope that the Speaker and other Republican leaders in the House avail themselves of the opportunity.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Ukraine -- reports today of pro-Russian insurgents pulling out of buildings, government buildings in the city of Mariupol.\xc2\xa0 And this is because steelworkers employed by one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine are patrolling the streets with police officers.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is that a welcome development at the White House?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a concern that the government in Kyiv is relying on oligarchs to essentially run the government in these tense regions?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s how I would interpret the story that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcome any indication that separatists that have seized buildings, who have set up roadblocks, stockpiled weapons, are vacating buildings and ceasing the kinds of activities that have only destabilized the situation in Ukraine and led to confrontations and violence.\xc2\xa0 So that would certainly be a good development.</p>\n<p class="p2">And the fact that significant portions of the population in Ukraine, including in eastern Ukraine, do not support the agenda of Russian-backed separatists but support a united Ukraine and support a process by which decisions around constitutional reform and devolution of power from the center are made in an appropriate way -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of issues that the Ukrainian government in Kyiv has promised will be discussed in dialogue with Ukrainians from all parts of the country at roundtables that are facilitated by the OSCE.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.</p>\n<p class="p2">And all of this comes as we move closer now to a presidential election on May 25.\xc2\xa0 And our focus and the focus of the OSCE and the Ukrainian government and all of our partners in this effort is on ensuring that those elections are able to go forward.\xc2\xa0 And the OSCE has reported that the preparations, the technical preparations for the elections are proceeding well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Separatists have disrupted preparations in some isolated areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, but in the vast majority of the country, as you know, Jim, the situation is calm and preparations are on track.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a good thing and a welcome development.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jeff.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, General Motors was assessed a $35 million fine today over its ignition switch issues.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that fine is enough?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed it with him.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to obviously the agency involved here, the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Safety and Traffic -- NTSB, whatever that acronym stands for.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re the bodies that you should address questions about it to.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been following that issue?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly broadly been following it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s received a lot of attention, understandably.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of that process, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I would have a lot to say about.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick foreign policy questions.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about the issue with China and Vietnam, and wanting that to be resolved in a way that is diplomatic and without provocation.\xc2\xa0 Do you want China to move the oil tanker?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d say about that -- and I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re closely following, out of our mission to Vietnam, the protests in Vietnam around this issue.\xc2\xa0 But regarding the broader issue of China\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral decision to introduce an oil rig accompanied by numerous government vessels for the first time in waters disputed with Vietnam, we would say what we have said repeatedly, which is this is a provocative act and it raises tensions in the region, and by raising tensions makes it more difficult to resolve claims over disputed territory in a manner that supports peace and stability in the region.</p>\n<p class="p2">So we consider that act provocative and we consider it one that undermines the goal that we share, which is a peaceful resolution of these disputes and general stability in the region.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about dangerous conduct and intimidation by government-controlled assets operating in this area.\xc2\xa0 And we call on all parties to conduct themselves in a safe and professional manner to preserve freedom of navigation and overflight, to exercise restraint, to take steps to lower tensions, and to address competing sovereignty claims peacefully and in accordance with international law.</p>\n<p class="p2">As you know, sovereignty over these islands, the Paracel Islands, is disputed.\xc2\xa0 This is occurring in waters claimed by both Vietnam and China near those islands.\xc2\xa0 These events highlight the need for claimants to clarify their claims in accordance with international law and to reach agreement on appropriate behavior and activities in disputed areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, the United States does not take a position on these competing sovereignty claims, but we do take a position on the conduct of the claimants who must resolve their disputes peacefully, without intimidation, without coercion, and in accordance with international law.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And one last foreign policy question.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to the election in India?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we congratulate India and the people of India on an historic national election, which saw more voters cast their ballots freely and fairly than in any election in human history.\xc2\xa0 We congratulate Narendra Modi and the BJP on winning a majority of seats in this historic election.\xc2\xa0 Once the government is formed, we look forward to working closely with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to advance our strong bilateral relationship based on shared democratic values.\xc2\xa0 We would also like to thank Prime Minister Singh for the role he played in transforming our strategic partnership during his 10 years in office.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Narendra Modi was banned the U.S. visa for the last 10 years.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that was a step which could not have been taken -- was not the right step in the direction at the time?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the question -- I understand about the visa, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the question?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that was a wrong step taken by the previous administration, or do you stand by that?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the State Department for general answers to questions about the issuance of visas.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the Prime Minister of India will be welcomed to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I would also note that U.S. officials, including Ambassador Powell, have met with Mr. Modi so he is certainly not unknown to us.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President have any plans to call him?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does plan to reach out to Mr. Modi, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when that\xe2\x80\x99s happened.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up, quickly?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Goyal.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One -- if the President preparing to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And second, if you can confirm if the President has received a farewell letter from outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh -\xe2\x80\x93 Dr. Manmohan Singh.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on any correspondence the President may have received, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little early to talk about a visit.\xc2\xa0 The President will be reaching out to Mr. Modi and, as I noted, we congratulate him and the BJP on winning a majority of seats in these historic elections.\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is an important relationship, a strong, bilateral partnership, and the President looks forward to building on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made with Prime Minister Singh in our relationship, in our bilateral relationship with the next Prime Minister.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the entire President\xe2\x80\x99s administration, all these eight years, Mr. Modi was banned from coming to the U.S. -- because there were several occasions when he was going to attend several functions in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a bitterness there between the two countries because of this?\xc2\xa0 And now there is a landslide victory by the BJP and Mr. Narendra Modi, and the sweep-out of the outgoing government.\xc2\xa0 What is the future of the U.S.\xe2\x80\x93India relationship?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the future is bright.\xc2\xa0 We have long said that we look forward to working with whomever the Indian people choose in these elections.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S.\xe2\x80\x93India partnership enjoys broad support across party lines in both of our countries.\xc2\xa0 And I am confident that we will continue our successful and productive partnership with the new Indian government.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to speaking with Mr. Modi and to working with the new government once it is formed.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move on.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on that?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get to \xe2\x80\x93- I promise I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a follow-up on the immigration question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering where the White House stands now on the issue in what is acceptable and what is not.\xc2\xa0 Is it essential still to the White House that whatever finally emerges from Congress include a path to citizenship?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 It is elemental to the principles that he put forward.\xc2\xa0 It is reflected in the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the President strongly believes that it needs to be a part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have long said that the House would necessarily pursue its own path in the construction of an immigration reform package, but comprehensive immigration reform is essential because the whole works together in a way that achieves all of the important benefits to the economy and to the country that we are looking for with the passage of this legislation.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a lot of parsing of \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ifs\xe2\x80\x9d because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a thing out of the House yet, and we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to the House acting on the urges we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard expressed and the interest and desire that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard expressed by Republicans, including Republican leaders on this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And we want to see comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We want to see comprehensive immigration reform that meets the test set by the President when he laid out his principles a number of years ago.\xc2\xa0 And those principles are reflected in the Senate bill, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times.\xc2\xa0 That bill does not exactly mirror what the President would have written if he were to write a bill and see it pass through Congress, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that what emerges from the House, if the House has the courage to act on this, to match word for word what he would prefer.\xc2\xa0 But what he does insist is that comprehensive immigration reform adhere to the principles he laid out in the beginning.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So whatever the legislative process, not parsing that, the final bill that he would sign into law must include a path to citizenship?\xc2\xa0 I just want to be --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that comprehensive immigration reform needs to include a path to citizenship.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he will not sign a law that is short of that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not sign a law -- there are just so many different --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He will not sign a bill that does not include a path to citizenship -- that\xe2\x80\x99s my question.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He signs a lot of bills that don\xe2\x80\x99t include paths to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know what I mean.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know what you mean, too, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do is -\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- so he\xe2\x80\x99s open to signing an immigration bill that falls short of a path to citizenship?\xc2\xa0 Is that still --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His position, unlike the position of others, has been absolutely consistent from beginning to end -- or to this point.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99re not at the end yet, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to change.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on the VA, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you and I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard others at the White House talk about the VA as having a good record on dealing with the backlog of claims and actually praising the VA on this issue.\xc2\xa0 In light of the way this -- as we learn more about problems and not just in the Arizona office, but in other parts of the country, are you still saying you think that the Veterans Administration has done a good job in dealing with the backlog of claims?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you still going to say that?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, Jon, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note -- and I tried to the other day when this came up -- you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating two separate things.\xc2\xa0 The disability claims, the backlog and disability claims -- this is a specific problem and challenge that the VA and the White House and others in the administration have been aggressively attacking.\xc2\xa0 And that is where you have seen a 50 percent reduction in the size of the backlog year over year, from this point to a year ago.\xc2\xa0 And that has been important progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And the size of that backlog increased significantly when this administration, because our veterans deserve it, made the decision that there would be a presumption of acceptance of a claim if you were a veteran claiming problems associated with exposure to Agent Orange.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that\xe2\x80\x99s ever been done; that\xe2\x80\x99s what this administration did.\xc2\xa0 If you were a veteran of the first Gulf War and you felt that you were a victim of problems associated with exposure in that war, and if you were a veteran of Iraq or Afghanistan and you experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, again, your claim would clear a hurdle automatically under this process that we established in this administration because we believe our veterans deserve it.\xc2\xa0 That immediately increased the population of people who had disability claims added to the backlog, and that backlog has been a focus of intense work and attention by the VA and the administration in general.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the matter of the absolute requirement that our veterans get the health care and services that they deserve and they get that in a timely fashion, the revelations or at least the allegations that have emerged from the situation in Phoenix I think have been greeted, in terms of reaction in the manner that Secretary Shinseki suggested yesterday, with a great deal of anger and frustration.\xc2\xa0 And if they prove to be true, people will be held accountable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">But these are matters -- and other issues that have been discussed in the wake of those allegations -- that are properly under review at the order of Secretary Shinseki, under investigation at the recommendation of Secretary Shinseki by the independent inspector general.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President and Chief of Staff here have responded to Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation by sending one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted aides over to VA to help with that review, to work with Secretary Shinseki on that review.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think that reflects the seriousness with which we approach this matter, our concern about some of the allegations that have been made.\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted to make sure that it was understood that there is a -- that the disability claims issue is not the same issue that is being discussed when we talk about the allegations in Phoenix.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think part of the confusion is when you and others have been asked about the problems in terms of veterans getting the health care that they need and deserve, you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered with talking points on the disability claim backlog.\xc2\xa0 So are you really -- I mean, are you suggesting that this is a problem that is limited to the Phoenix office?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there is an active review, as well as an investigation by the IG that will determine both what happened in Phoenix and, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, what happened elsewhere if some of the other allegations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen merit investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">What I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying is that under Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s leadership there has been a firm dedication to providing the kind of services that our veterans deserve.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in some of the decisions that were made to increase access to disability claims and to health care.\xc2\xa0 We have under his leadership reduced veterans homelessness by 24 percent.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve provided Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to more than 1 million students.\xc2\xa0 And we have decreased the disability claims.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My point is that when I talk about the progress that has been made, I have been referring to questions about Secretary Shinseki and his leadership of the Veterans Affairs Department, and that progress has come on his watch and he certainly deserves credit for it.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it sounds strange, though, that given the evidence that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing coming out and suggestions that veterans have actually died waiting to get health services --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the word you used is essential because you said the \xe2\x80\x9csuggestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And this matter is under investigation -- I would point you to what the IG said yesterday.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But here you are praising the VA for all the things that have been done under Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just explain the way you just asked that question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a suggestion that something terrible happened in Phoenix -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation.\xc2\xa0 All we know is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a suggestion.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that there has been a real problem with the quality of health care that our veterans are getting?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this is going to be -- we still need to study this further?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s enough to act on right now to say that our veterans aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting the care that they need?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are acting on the allegations and the suggestions that you pointed out, and I would point you to what the IG said yesterday about his ongoing investigation into the\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to investigate more?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 We should just accept allegations as true without investigating them?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would be a normal procedure.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, we are moving aggressively in a host of areas to ensure that our veterans are getting the services and the care that they deserve.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected not least in the fact that the President has requested increases in the budget for the VA every year he has been in office in a time of very tight budgets.\xc2\xa0 And he has insisted when it came to the serious matter of the disability backlog that we attack that problem with aggression and with substantial resources, and that\xe2\x80\x99s resulted in the reduction in the backlog.\xc2\xa0 And that reduction needs to be eliminated -- I mean, the backlog has been reduced, but it needs to be eliminated, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of making sure that our veterans are being taken care of.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow-up on what Jon was asking, if General Shinseki is \xe2\x80\x9cmad as hell\xe2\x80\x9d about what went on, why is it the White House position that it\xe2\x80\x99s just allegations and suggestions?\xc2\xa0 It seems to me he has made a conclusion in his mind that something bad happened.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to his testimony.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, if what has been alleged is true, that would be an outrage.\xc2\xa0 And that is an opinion shared by the President, by Secretary Shinseki, and I think everyone else who has looked at this matter and works on these issues.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he expressed it?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was asked about the allegations and answered forthrightly and expressed his concern about it.\xc2\xa0 The actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken reflect the concern that we have about it.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that he has sent one of his most trusted and top aides from the White House over to the VA to assist the Secretary in his review reflects the seriousness with which we take this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">But, again, I would simply say that it stands to reason that when allegations are made, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that they are investigated to find out the truth behind the matter before we just assume that what happened or what\xe2\x80\x99s said to have happened is true.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in any way prejudging, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ought to prejudge.\xc2\xa0 I do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of enough concern that the actions that Secretary Shinseki has taken and the actions that the President and the White House have taken are merited, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to aggressively tackle this problem.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should the American people be able to trust -- the President says he\xe2\x80\x99s -- you said the President is sending over one of his most trusted aides to oversee this.\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t General Shinseki one of his most trusted aides?\xc2\xa0 Why should the American public look at that and say, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do instead of bringing somebody in from the outside perhaps to look at what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at the VA?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, what I can tell you is the President has confidence in Secretary Shinseki, someone with an incredibly admirable record in the military and in service to our veterans.\xc2\xa0 And, again, under Secretary Shinseki there has been significant progress.\xc2\xa0 There remains a lot of work to do when it comes to making sure that our veterans get the services and care that they deserve, but Secretary Shinseki is aggressively tackling the challenges that we face on these matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And when we see revelations like or accusations like what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with regards to the office in Phoenix, it was certainly our view when Secretary Shinseki suggested it to our Chief of Staff that it was the right thing to do to add capacity, if you will, in order to make the effort more intense and more rapid to Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s team by sending Rob Nabors over to the VA.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on that point about the President speaking out -- today, for the second time this week alone, he talked about transportation funding, infrastructure funding because it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority for him.\xc2\xa0 If fixing this VA problem is a priority for him, why have we not heard from him since April 28th?\xc2\xa0 A lot has happened since he spoke out at that news conference.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, a lot has happened.\xc2\xa0 There have been allegations.\xc2\xa0 The Veterans Affairs administration has responded to those allegations by launching a review and suggesting and recommending and soliciting that the independent IG investigate.\xc2\xa0 The President has asked his Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, one of his most trusted advisors, to temporarily take an assignment over at the VA to assist Secretary Shinseki in that effort.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Shinseki, as you know, was testifying on Capitol Hill just yesterday about this.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is something that, again, the President cares deeply about when it comes to our veterans and ensuring that we provide for them in a way that honors the service they provided us.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is he not speaking directly to veterans on this and saying, this is how much it matters and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fix it?\xc2\xa0 Your words are important, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re -- on transportation funding, for example, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just have you do it; he gets out there and says, Congress has to move on this.\xc2\xa0 Why is he not out directing veterans on this?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, he is taking action, Ed.\xc2\xa0 He has responded to this.\xc2\xa0 He has spoken about it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be an opportunity for him to speak about it again.\xc2\xa0 I think you would be the first to say that if -- and maybe you would, since Congress isn\xe2\x80\x99t acting yet on transportation -- that speaking alone does not get the job done; acting gets the job done.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to transportation --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but you push them along.\xc2\xa0 But he pushes them along.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give up if Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I may, Ed, when it comes to transportation funding, that requires action by Congress so to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t thrown off the job come August.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to taking the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken as an administration in response to allegations, that\xe2\x80\x99s something we can do and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President is directing.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you react directly to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor?\xc2\xa0 He put out a statement yesterday saying he believes there\xe2\x80\x99s a pattern at the White House where the Cabinet Secretaries take all the heat and the President ultimately is just not held accountable.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that this briefing suggests otherwise.\xc2\xa0 I would say --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s you, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the President.\xc2\xa0 A briefing is not -\xe2\x80\x93 the point is that the Cabinet Secretaries --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that in the time that since those allegations emerged in the press, the President has given four or five press conferences, so I think he has had the opportunity to address this and has been asked about it.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be other opportunities for him to address this.\xc2\xa0 But what he has also done is acted on it and so has Secretary Shinseki.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one is -- you were talking about immigration earlier and that the clock is ticking, and minimum wage, a lot of other important priorities that the President has been pushing \xe2\x80\x93- transportation funding as well.\xc2\xa0 Is there any fear at all with Congress having hearings, that IG is having an investigation, there was talk yesterday that the FBI may get involved because there may be criminal charges in the VA scandal if, in fact, people did die because of this.\xc2\xa0 My question being is there any fear that this is a big \xe2\x80\x93- I struggle to use the word distraction because it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue that veterans get their health care, but is this something that overshadows the attention of Congress right now so you can\xe2\x80\x99t get immigration and other stuff done?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that it\xe2\x80\x99s an important matter and that the resources necessary to tackle it so that we are providing the services and benefits that veterans deserve are merited, and the attention that is paid to it by those who are concerned about the problem as opposed to politics is absolutely appropriate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how the President views it.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the government have any confidence, this administration have any confidence that the Nigerians can ever retrieve the young women, particularly in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s news that President Jonathan was supposed to go to the village from which they were kidnapped and decided at the last minute not to go?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that, first of all, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that the Nigerian people, the Nigerians face a real threat in Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 Boko Haram has demonstrated it has no regard for human life and it has demonstrated an increased ability to conduct attacks, and those attacks have increased in frequency and lethality.\xc2\xa0 So this organization poses a serious threat in that country.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the efforts undertaken by the Nigerian government to find these girls, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that, in our view, time is of the essence and that we can and are assisting the Nigerian government in the search, but the Nigerian government has the lead and needs to act accordingly.\xc2\xa0 Now, we are -\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be making any progress.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean the girls haven\xe2\x80\x99t been found?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think what we -- I think the --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, signs from Nigeria are not encouraging.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think a circumstance -- I mean, I think that it was important -- and I tried to do this when we first started talking about the assistance the United States was going to provide -- to understand that despite the expertise we have, the capacities we have, and the kind of assets that we can bring to bear in this, that this is a tremendous challenge.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about fewer than 300 people who are being searched for in an area at least the size of West Virginia, portions of which are very densely forested, as I understand it.\xc2\xa0 So this is a difficult challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And, again, this is a population of kidnapped girls that we hope remains intact and together, but obviously if they have been separated that makes the challenge even greater -- which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we won\xe2\x80\x99t provide all the assistance and assets that we can in that effort in helping Nigeria conduct this search, but it is certainly a challenge.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the security situation is apparently so bad that the President of the country cancelled a visit to the area today.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that a question?\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that the security situation, because of Boko Haram, is real is one that is self-evident and which I discussed moments ago.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we can\xe2\x80\x99t and that they can\xe2\x80\x99t conduct a search, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already, as I discussed earlier this week, launched both manned and unmanned aircraft as part of the reconnaissance effort, and we have a team of personnel assisting the Nigerian government in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 Other nations have lent their support to the effort and we hope that it will bear fruit and we will find the girls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has President Obama spoken to President Goodluck Jonathan, or does he plan to?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have a reaction to canceling his trip?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Nigerian officials, U.S. officials, officials from Britain and France are going to meet over the weekend and discuss their strategy moving forward.\xc2\xa0 What is the anticipation on the part of this White House about the tangibles that might come out of that meeting -- the series of meetings?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we are focused on assisting the Nigerians in developing a concrete plan and a concrete approach to finding out where the girls are and recovering them so that they can be returned to their families.\xc2\xa0 And that requires coordination and it requires strategy.\xc2\xa0 And I assume that these conversations will be focused on that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Bill\xe2\x80\x99s line of questioning, you have Alice Friend, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Director of African Affairs, talking about some of her frustrations, frustrations on the part of the United States with the Nigerian government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cslow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you flesh out what some of the other frustrations are that the U.S. feels in terms of working with the government of Nigeria?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the challenge that Nigeria faces from this group is a serious one, and there are all sorts of issues that she and others have identified that make the challenge even greater and that we try to address as a friend of Nigeria in the assistance that we provide.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">That\'s why we provide security assistance, to increase Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to meet the threat, including by helping professionalize its military and helping it carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why we provide law enforcement assistance, to help Nigeria bring those responsible for attacks on civilians to justice.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why we support programs and initiatives that are aimed at combating violent extremist ideology, including by creating economic alternatives for those vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have a coordinated effort that is designed to help strengthen Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond responsibly and effectively to these challenges in a way that ensures civilians are protected and human rights are respected.\xc2\xa0 And responding responsibly and effectively is important because that\'s, in effect, how you provide support for and reassurance to the population that is also having to deal with the threat posed by an organization like Boko Haram.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one on Rob Nabors.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline for the review that he is conducting?\xc2\xa0 Has the President said, I want you to --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For questions like that, I would refer you to the VA.\xc2\xa0 They are obviously conducting the review.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have a timeline on Rob\xe2\x80\x99s stay over at the VA except to say that it is temporary and he will be coming back and returning to his responsibilities as Deputy Chief of Staff here when that assignment is finished.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House has repeatedly expressed confidence in Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, progress under his watch.\xc2\xa0 But the way that this all came out -- even if you\'re going to keep calling them all allegations and they seem to be more widespread than one hospital -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that in itself indicate a major shortfall in his oversight and leadership of the administration?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, I think I\'ve addressed this question. What we have seen in response to the allegations that have been reported is a review instigated by the Secretary, one that we are now providing a senior White House official to assist --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is the way it came out, that this was all</p>\n<p class="p1">-- all of these problems that have been built up and widespread, it all came out through reporting by the press, that some of this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even known about.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that, in and of itself, indicate a major shortfall there?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, there are active reviews and investigations into what happened, and I think, again, I\'m not going to pass judgment on what happened until we\'ve seen the conclusion of an investigation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s generally a wise approach to take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, should some of these allegations prove to be true, Secretary Shinseki has made clear that he would be outraged by that and angry by that -- the President certainly would be -- and he would expect people to be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why there\xe2\x80\x99s a review.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the role of the press, I think the press, in general -- and again, I\'m not going to pass judgment on whether or not the allegations are true because we don\'t know, but the role of the press is important in general as a -- on matters like this and in so many other areas.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t sell the press short when it comes to the important role they play.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iran, these reports that have come out this week that Iran is actively pursuing ballistic missiles, what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view of that and the possibility of eventually reaching a nuclear deal?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the question of ballistic missiles, we have made clear that all issues of concern are on the table during the P5-plus-1 negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re not going to get into details of specific items of negotiations because negotiating in public wouldn\'t serve the goal here, but I would point you to the fact that the Joint Plan of Action lays out very clearly the elements for a comprehensive agreement and it talks about all concerns needing to be addressed, and it talks about making sure that we know that, in fact, this is an entirely peaceful program.\xc2\xa0 It also talks about U.N. Security Council resolutions needing to be addressed, including provisions relating to ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So ballistic missiles fall into the topics under discussion that would need to be part of a comprehensive resolution of this dispute and this challenge.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the view we take.\xc2\xa0 Without sort of teasing out any individual item and talking about how that concern would have to be addressed in the final product, what we will do is point you to those U.N. Security Council resolutions, the fact that the Joint Plan of Action explicitly calls for those concerns to be resolved, and make clear that everything in the JPA is on the table and has to be resolved for a comprehensive agreement to be reached.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 On the Ukraine elections, a statement that the Vice President put out this week used the word, \xe2\x80\x9cdelegitimize\xe2\x80\x9d in the statement, that Russia would face additional costs should it disrupt or delegitimize the election results.\xc2\xa0 My question is a follow-up on a question earlier, which is who is the arbiter for the results of the election, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re disrupted or delegitimized, since sectoral sanctions would be so important to determine a range. \xc2\xa0Who decides that?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, there will be international observers organized by the OSCE who will be able to make judgments about the conduct of the election and any efforts to undermine the election or delegitimize it.\xc2\xa0 The United States and the rest of our partners in the international community who have taken one side on this matter, and Russia, which has taken another side, I think will make judgments about how the elections proceed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">President Putin, back when he also said or suggested that the so-called referenda should not be held on May 11, also said that the May 25 election might be a good step.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly agree with that -- not just might be, but a necessary and important step -- for the Ukrainian people because it would -- successful implementation of that election would allow the Ukrainian people to freely express their will when it comes to choosing their leader, their president.\xc2\xa0 And we are very focused on ensuring, with our partners, that the election takes place.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a small matter, but the President has a minor cold.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not suggesting that he\xe2\x80\x99s ill, but here\xe2\x80\x99s the question -- I can\'t find any public record that the President has had his full medical workup, his usual exam, since before the election. \xc2\xa0And maybe I missed it.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us, update us when --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t looked into that.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Zeke.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the FCC voted to create what they call Internet \xe2\x80\x9cfast lanes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, the President, as candidate in 2007, 2008, said he would oppose such efforts.\xc2\xa0 Is the President disappointed by the FCC decision, or is he contemplating going back on his campaign promise from six years ago?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear since he was a candidate, Zeke, that he strongly supports net neutrality and an open Internet.\xc2\xa0 As he has said, the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s incredible equality of data, content and access to the consumer is what has powered extraordinary economic growth and made it possible for once tiny sites like eBay and Amazon to compete with brick-and-mortar operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The FCC is an independent agency, as you know, and we will carefully review their proposal.\xc2\xa0 The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were dealt a real challenge by the Court of Appeals in January, but Chairman Wheeler has said his goal is to preserve an open Internet, and we are pleased to see that he is keeping all options on the table.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will be watching closely as the process moves forward in hopes that the final rule stays true to the spirit of net neutrality.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking at every way to protect a free and open Internet and we will -- and he will consider any option that might make sense.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the rule that was passed yesterday meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s standards for net neutrality?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the rule -- what was passed yesterday was something that kept options on the table.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a yes or no, though.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you have all options on the table, then the President will be looking very closely to see that the outcome of this results in a final rule that stays true to the spirit of net neutrality, which he supports.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Secretary Johnson said on PBS Newshour that you might be looking at changes -- or the President might be looking at changes to the Secure Communities program that\xe2\x80\x99s part of reforming the deportation policy.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have anything on that?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that comment.\xc2\xa0 What I think you know is that the President asked Secretary Johnson to address -- to review procedures when it comes to enforcement, and that review is underway.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the department for any status update they might have.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also this week, there were some documents released to Judicial Watch through FOYA -- a lawsuit -- that did appear that the Washington office of IRS did have more to do with targeting some of the tea party groups in this.\xc2\xa0 Does that --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that report, so I don\'t have a response.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, does the White House still believe that this was entirely out of the Cincinnati office, as the President said during the Super Bowl interview?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed and I certainly haven\'t seen any facts that suggest otherwise.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\'t seen the report that you mentioned.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious about this sports concussion event.\xc2\xa0 It will be a public event?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the President hoping to get out of it?\xc2\xa0 Will there be a list of recommendations?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We hope to see and expect to see some public and private commitments made towards the study of and education\xc2\xa0 about this problem.\xc2\xa0 I think the President, as a father who also has on his staff others who are parents, knows that this is a topic that a lot of families are discussing right now as more and more information is provided about the problems associated with concussions in sports, especially for our young.\xc2\xa0 And we have the ability here, because it\'s the White House and because he\xe2\x80\x99s the President, to help elevate this issue and help draw attention to it and support for efforts to make progress on it so that we can ensure that our kids are being able to get all the benefits that come from participating in sports but are able to do so in as safe a way as possible.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was Roger Goodell invited?\xc2\xa0 Will he be attending?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a list of attendees at this time.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is we aren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to announce participants or commitments at this time, but the President recognizes that raising awareness of and better protecting children and student athletes from concussions, and better identifying and treating them when they do occur requires a team approach.\xc2\xa0 And professional sports leagues, including the NFL, are certainly vital members of that team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is an effort that a lot of people can be involved in and should be involved in.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that is often talked about within the context of football.\xc2\xa0 I have a son who\xe2\x80\x99s expressing interest in playing tackle football, so it\'s something that I\'m particularly interested in, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t limit itself just to football.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ve seen a lot of reports about concussions in other sports, including soccer.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that I think a lot of families spend a lot of time worrying about and want to know as much as they can about, and want to be sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking all the precautions they can on behalf of their children so their children can get all the great experiences that come from participating in sports.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question on this.\xc2\xa0 How does he prepare for an event like this?\xc2\xa0 Is he reading books?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some good ones -- League of Denial.\xc2\xa0 Frontline has done some documentaries.\xc2\xa0 I\'m curious about how he prepares for --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that it\'s something that he has addressed when asked a couple of times in interviews where he\'s noted that if he had a son he would have to think twice about saying yes to having him play football.\xc2\xa0 There have been -- obviously the report that came out last fall that helped spark this conversation, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of research that\'s been done within the government, including within the military, on some of these issues.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have specific reading lists, but I know that it\'s a topic of conversation here just like it is around the country.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tejinder.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 The first one is the ambassador already has retired and is expected to leave during this month.\xc2\xa0 Who is going to be the top diplomat in Delhi?\xc2\xa0 You\'re sending somebody from here to start the dialogue?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 It\'s obviously a very important post, but when the President has an announcement to make he\'ll make it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you sending somebody from here, one of your diplomats, to start?\xc2\xa0 Because if you see the baggage of nearly 10 years of visa denial, just a statement welcoming him may not bring him here.\xc2\xa0 So will the U.S. go beyond?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to speak to him about his views on this matter.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think we\'ve made clear that we congratulate the Indian people and Mr. Modi and his party on their victory.\xc2\xa0 We await the formation of a government, and we absolutely look forward to continuing all the progress that we have made in our bilateral relationship, and fully expect to be able to do so.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just looking at the personal level, will it be kind of a hiccup, and if we are ready to do something to address that on a personal level?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the Prime Minister of India will receive a visa to travel to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to working with the new government and the new Prime Minister, and we congratulate Mr. Modi and his party on their victory.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate any problem in that regard.\xc2\xa0 What we do anticipate is moving forward with the new government and strengthening a relationship that has already been strengthened significantly over the past years with Prime Minister Singh at the helm in India.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any result on the President\xe2\x80\x99s call today to President Erdogan regarding the mine disaster?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a readout for you.\xc2\xa0 When we do we\'ll get it to you.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, Secretary Hagel said that he was open to a review of the military\xe2\x80\x99s ban on transgender servicemembers.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President would back that review and whether or not he\'s had any conversations with the Defense Secretary about that issue.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President speaks with Secretary Hagel regularly, meets with him weekly.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a readout on all his conversations, but I would certainly point you to what Secretary Hagel said and certainly we support his efforts in this area.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President I don\'t think has ever spoken out on this issue before.\xc2\xa0 Does he think that that ban should eventually be lifted?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply at this point leave it to Secretary Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to him directly about this issue, but I would note what Secretary Hagel said and that we support him.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with Chinese PLA General Fang who said yesterday that the Asia rebalance strategy has emboldened Vietnam in its territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say what I said earlier about the need for parties to these disputes to address them in a peaceful and diplomatic way, in keeping with international norms and international law.\xc2\xa0 I would note what I said about the unilateral decision and provocative one when it came to the -- when it comes to the oil rig and our calling on all sides to restrain -- refrain from taking actions that inflame tensions, as opposed to actions that calm the situation and allow for peaceful dialogue about it and resolution about the dispute.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Week ahead, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99re right.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, before you give us the week ahead, can you just\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You got breaking news on your device?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, this is not breaking news.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us the President\xe2\x80\x99s reflections as we approach the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously meeting with some of the family members of the plaintiffs today.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And maybe tell us why that event is closed to press.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a private meeting that the President is having with families.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the First Lady will be speaking publicly about the anniversary of this landmark Supreme Court decision this evening in Topeka, Kansas.\xc2\xa0 The President feels, as I think so many people do around the country, that this decision was historic, that it enabled millions of Americans to get a better education.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a good story this morning about the First Lady and how that decision affected her life, which I think speaks to why it is so appropriate for her to be speaking on it tonight.\xc2\xa0 We have more work to do, and that\'s why the President has the aggressive education agenda that he has.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he is focused on making pre-kindergarten education available to all in this country, because that early start is so essential for a child\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way in 60 years, and this is an important anniversary to note.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are that that is true and that also we need to keep moving forward when it comes to ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to provide a quality education to all of our kids.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me give you the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will have lunch with combatant commanders.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President will attend a DCCC event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Wednesday, the President will participate in an ambassador credentialing ceremony in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 At this event the President will receive the credentials from foreign ambassadors recently posted in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The presentation of credentials is a traditional ceremony that marks the formal beginning of ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s service here.\xc2\xa0 Afterward, the President will welcome the Super Bowl Champion Seattle Seahawks to the White House to honor the team and their Super Bowl victory.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Thursday, the President will travel to Chicago to participate in two events for the DSCC.\xc2\xa0 The President will remain in Chicago overnight.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Friday, he will return to Washington from Chicago.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would be remiss in noting -- in not noting as I leave here that today is Kathy Ruemmler\xe2\x80\x99s last day, and we at the White House will all miss her wisdom and good humor.\xc2\xa0 And we wish her well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:15 P.M.
