CDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I hope you enjoyed the day or two we spent in the Twin Cities.\xc2\xa0 I know for some of you that was a homecoming.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly enjoyed the opportunity to spend some time outside of Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI might just add at the top that I think the last 24 hours have served as a rather apt illustration of the different approaches that are pursued by our elected leaders in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 On the one hand, you have a President who is bound and determined to do anything he can, either working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress or working around Republicans, to make progress on policies that would expand economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the other hand, you have Republicans in Congress who seem just as bound and determined to use every means at their disposal to try to stop the President from moving the country forward.\xc2\xa0 And in effect, that seems to preserve some of the built-in advantages that benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can anticipate that the President will be spending more time in the weeks ahead sort of demonstrating his determination to benefit middle-class families, and highlighting the starkly different approaches.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was this speech his kickoff for his role heading to the midterms?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I would characterize this as yet another opportunity for the President to highlight the stark difference in approaches that I was talking about at the beginning.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to ask you about the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Russia is already threatening trade sanctions against Ukraine for signing a political and economic pact with the EU.\xc2\xa0 If Russia follows through with that, would that constitute the kind of destabilizing actions that would prompt U.S. sectoral sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start with some comments that I do have on this.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there were some conversations that took place between President Poroshenko and members of the U.N. -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the European Council earlier today.\xc2\xa0 The European Council and the United States will continue to seek immediate and positive stabilizing action from the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 Comments from President Putin, like the ones that you cited, are meant to intimidate the Ukrainian government, and are simply unhelpful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs the Council said, we expect that by Monday, June 30th, this coming Monday, that the following steps will be taken:\xc2\xa0 First, that there\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement on a verification mechanism monitored by the OSCE for the ceasefire and for the effective control of the border between Ukraine and Russia.\xc2\xa0 Second, that there be a return to Ukrainian authorities of all three border checkpoints.\xc2\xa0 Third, that the remaining OSCE observers who have been held hostage will be released along with all of the other hostages that have been taken.\xc2\xa0 And fourth, that there would be the launch of substantial negotiations on the implementation of the peace plan that President Poroshenko put forward.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me also use this opportunity to reiterate our call for President Putin to move Russian combat forces away from the border, to cease support for separatists, and to urge separatists to abide by the ceasefire and disarm.\xc2\xa0 Together, these actions would send a clear signal that Russia is interested in a diplomatic settlement resulting in stability in eastern Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked frequently about the potential that Russia has and that President Putin personally has to play a constructive role in de-escalating the conflict there.\xc2\xa0 And these are some examples of the kinds of steps that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see by Monday to demonstrate his commitment to playing that constructive role.\xc2\xa0 Threats of trade sanctions would be a pretty good example of the kinds of things that we would consider unhelpful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, the kinds of agreements that Ukraine and Georgia and Moldova signed today are the kinds of agreements that should be decisions made solely by those sovereign governments.\xc2\xa0 And the undue influence by outside actors is completely inappropriate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned June 30th.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the significance of that deadline?\xc2\xa0 Do sanctions follow the day after?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have demonstrated -- well, I guess I would say that we have signaled a clear willingness to act in concert with our partners and allies to further isolate Russia.\xc2\xa0 There have already been some steps that have been taken that have isolated Russia from the international community as a result of the unhelpful actions of the Russians, and additional unhelpful actions would lead to additional economic costs that would have to be borne by Russia.\xc2\xa0 That is an option that remains on the table.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 June 30th is a pretty important day then.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is an important day in the context of seeing Russian action on the steps that I just outlined.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to draw a clear line between these steps and sanctions at this point, but suffice it to say that the threat of sanctions only looms larger, and economic costs would increase, if Russia fails to take these actions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all four of these actions are prerequisites in your mind?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All four of these are very specific steps that we would like to see the Russians take in advance of Monday.\xc2\xa0 And failing to take them only increases the likelihood that additional economic costs could be imposed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about the meeting this afternoon on the VA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President is planning to meet with the acting head of the Veterans Administration, Sloan Gibson, and Rob Nabors, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Deputy Chief of Staff that the President sent over to the VA to look into so many of the problems that have been uncovered in recent weeks at the VA.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout in advance of that meeting, but I know that we are working to try to provide you some information at the conclusion of that meeting about what they discussed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the timing for naming a new Secretary of the VA?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be a topic of discussion?\xc2\xa0 Is that imminent today, next week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of the timing.\xc2\xa0 That remains a very high priority of this administration to install new leadership at the VA, to start putting in place some of the reforms that, frankly, were initiated by the previous VA Secretary, and have also been recommended by some of the other individuals who are looking at the problems at the VA.\xc2\xa0 I know that the inspector general is working hard at this.\xc2\xa0 You know that Mr. Nabors is also working hard to put together a report assessing some of the problems at the VA and maybe offering up some reforms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s some very important work that needs to get done at the VA, and that work will be enhanced when there is new permanent leadership at the VA.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of timing, but that search remains a high priority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that guy at the Cleveland Clinic withdrew, did that kind of put you guys back to starting all over again in your search?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had an ongoing process for some time, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress in that process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed the choices?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress, and it remains a high priority.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer up any guidance in terms of timing at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President several times on this trip seemed be very critical of the news media.\xc2\xa0 Why was he sort of stressing that message on this trip in particular?\xc2\xa0 He seemed to also sort of be tying in the news media with the Republicans of just focusing on false scandals and the wrong storylines.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how I interpreted his remarks.\xc2\xa0 My interpretation is that so much of what -- that what Washington is focused on seems to be materially different than what people all across the country are focused on.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that as an indictment of the news media.\xc2\xa0 I see that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear these things covered, you won\xe2\x80\x99t see this on the nightly news; we had a conference the other day on working families, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the nightly news a lot.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are the things he was saying several times.\xc2\xa0 At the fundraiser he said it as well.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the White House has said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch TV news, but yet he was very critical of the TV news.\xc2\xa0 How does he know what they\xe2\x80\x99re covering or what they\xe2\x80\x99re not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To say that he\xe2\x80\x99s not a regular viewer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s on it.\xc2\xa0 But look, I think what the President is trying to highlight is his commitment to focusing on those issues that are the subject of so many discussions around kitchen tables in middle-class homes all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And those issues may not be as sexy or as intellectually captivating as some of the other things that are on the news more regularly, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re less important to millions of families all across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn fact, at least to this President, those kinds of discussions about balancing work and family obligations, and expanding economic opportunity, and better access to job training and a college education -- these are the kinds of bread-and-butter issues that, again, aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily sexy issues, but they have been the primary motivation for this President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda since he decided to enter the presidential race in early 2007.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s not an indictment of any specific news organization, but it is an indictment I think of Republicans who are focused on different priorities.\xc2\xa0 After all, they were ostensibly elected by their constituents to focus on the kinds of issues that will have the most direct impact on the lives of their constituents.\xc2\xa0 All I can say is that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what we have seen is a pretty apt comparison between a President who\xe2\x80\x99s bound and determined to do everything he can to benefit middle-class families, and Republicans in Congress who are bound and determined to stop the President from making progress on behalf of middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been general polls that say that, in the midterms, that Republicans are likely to pick up seats in the House and potentially win the Senate.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s true, then why does the President believe that maybe the public does actually believe in what this Republican message that he\xe2\x80\x99s so critical about is actually translating better than his own message?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is that these sort of electoral polls are going to go up and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go down.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President is interested in is having a broader national conversation about what we can do to make sure that Washington, D.C., remains responsive and in touch with the concerns that are expressed and experienced in the everyday lives of so many middle-class families.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the benefits of holding up the story of Rebekah Erler, from Minnesota -- that so many of the controversies and political conflict that\xe2\x80\x99s highlighted on the evening news isn\xe2\x80\x99t just relevant in her life as much more basic elements of what are we going to do to make quality childcare less expensive; what are we going to do to make it a little easier for somebody to take off work if a child or a parent gets sick; what are we going to do to make sure that middle-class families have an opportunity to send their kids to college and save for retirement, and also have enough money set aside to take a modest vacation with their kids.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese are basic fundamental issues.\xc2\xa0 And again, I understand why these issues are in the evening news every night.\xc2\xa0 I understand why they\xe2\x80\x99re not on the front page of an influential newspaper like The Washington Post.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because, again, they\xe2\x80\x99re not as sexy.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t make --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say something about the Post, the Post won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism about poverty this year -- Eli Saslow.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to point that out.\xc2\xa0 Some of our best-read content.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I did not mean that as a criticism of the Post.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I genuinely didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not an intentional jab to suggest that The Washington Post is an influential newspaper.\xc2\xa0 It actually is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 You said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the front page.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the front page every day I think is the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making.\xc2\xa0 It has been on the front page.\xc2\xa0 And I remember Eli did some good work where he traveled to Kentucky and sat with people were signing up people who were benefitting from Obamacare.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he wrote a book about the President\xe2\x80\x99s letters that you got, if I recall.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s good work that\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the -- again, those aren\xe2\x80\x99t the blaring headlines on the front page of the Post.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that as a criticism of the people who are making those decisions.\xc2\xa0 I just want to suggest that there is a difference -- that while the stories that are being covered and getting front-page attention are leading the network news are interesting, and in many cases very important to the future of this country.\xc2\xa0 The conflict in Iraq in has been in the news and on the front page of The Washington Post a lot.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue.\xc2\xa0 But there are also important issues related to the day-to-day challenges experienced by middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think what the President is saying is that even if they\xe2\x80\x99re not on the front page of The Washington Post every day, they are at the top of his mind every day when he wakes up and goes to work in the Oval Office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about landmines and the announcement this morning that the U.S. will stop acquiring them.\xc2\xa0 What is the current size of the U.S. stockpile of landmines?\xc2\xa0 And are they currently being used anywhere in the world?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to detail the inventory of landmines that are in the U.S. stockpile.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there was a commitment that was announced today that the United States will not produce or otherwise acquire any anti-personnel landmines in the future, including to replace existing stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is we were signaling our clear aspiration to eventually accede to the Ottawa Convention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, that does raise the question in the minds of some defense experts about the defenses that are in place along the border between North Korea and South Korea.\xc2\xa0 And let me just be clear that the announcement today in no way signals a reduction in our commitment or our ability to assist in the defense of our allies in South Korea.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require some additional study.\xc2\xa0 And eventually, we would like to find a way that we can, like I said, continue the robust defense that\xe2\x80\x99s in place of our allies in South Korea while eventually acceding to the Ottawa Convention.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it those concerns about the situation on the Korean Peninsula that is keeping the U.S., despite this announcement, from immediately just starting to destroy our stockpile or at least committing not to use them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to sort of give you a thorough analysis of all the reasons that we may not be ready to accede to that convention today.\xc2\xa0 But I do think it is a notable adjustment of U.S. policy that we are now articulating our desire to be able to accede to the Ottawa Convention.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, we do that knowing that our commitment to protecting our allies in South Korea has in no way been diminished.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Syria, on the announcement of the President\xe2\x80\x99s request for half a billion dollars to help train the rebels, does that signal that the situation in Iraq and in Syria has basically become one regional conflict?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are certainly regional elements to the violence and destabilizing activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in that region.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think what the announcement that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen represents a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, there has been a -- there\xe2\x80\x99s already been a wide range of efforts in place to support moderate elements of the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past that this includes a significant amount of humanitarian assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s been provided to the opposition but also to countries in the region who are dealing with the consequences of the violence and instability that has racked that country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen the provision of a wide range of both military and non-military assistance to the Syrian opposition -- to moderate elements of the Syrian opposition, I should say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the second thing is that this is an announcement that additional vetting has been done that makes the U.S. government and the Obama administration in particular more comfortable with providing additional assistance to moderate elements of the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important next step.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUltimately, though, one element of our policy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, which is that finally resolving the situation in Syria is going to require a diplomatic solution.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that it\xe2\x80\x99s a little disheartening that a diplomatic solution seems quite a ways off, but that continues to be, in our judgment, the only resolution to that ongoing conflict.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an expectation for timing on how Congress will take up that request?\xc2\xa0 And is it too little, too late already?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, primarily because I think that they are -- this may be, at the risk of sounding na\xc3\xafve and overly optimistic, an area where there could be some bipartisan common ground.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, frankly, due at least in part to our travels to Minnesota, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen all of the reaction from leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill to this request for additional funding for overseas contingency operations, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, Congress will act pretty quickly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know that, at least rhetorically, there have been some influential Republican members of Congress who have indicated that this would be a good thing to do, but I would understand if they\xe2\x80\x99d want to take a look at our proposal and consider it more carefully before eventually taking action.\xc2\xa0 But hopefully, that can be done quickly, and action in the legislature can be done quickly as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our reports have armed drones flying over Iraq, and then also Iranian drones doing surveillance.\xc2\xa0 So any reaction or updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, there\xe2\x80\x99s reports that Khattalah is going to be back in the U.S. as soon as this weekend, so any updates on or briefings that he\xe2\x80\x99s had on that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first let me say that I think that we have acknowledged -- well, I know that we have acknowledged that we have increased the amount of intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment in Iraq, including surveillance drones.\xc2\xa0 This is part of our effort to try to get a better sense about what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening on the ground in Iraq as it relates to the strength of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously talked about, and that is an effort that is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And we have acknowledged publicly that the increase in resources now allows us to have around-the-clock eyes on the situation in Iraq.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of armed drones, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 For operational details, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But the second thing is that the President has reiterated his commitment many times to making sure that we have the resources in place and the equipment in place to provide for the protection of U.S. personnel in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There have been other moves that have been announced by the Department of Defense to ensure that those resources and that equipment and those capabilities are at the ready.\xc2\xa0 That included the movement of an aircraft carrier in the region and other Navy vessels to provide for the protection of U.S. personnel in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of individual operational changes in our posture, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of Abu Khattalah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates in terms of the timing of his arrival in the United States to stand trial.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have a week ahead.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one before the week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Rebekah\xe2\x80\x99s letter, although the President quoted from it extensively in his speech.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to get to see that?\xc2\xa0 If not, why?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Only because the letter included some personal details about her family\xe2\x80\x99s situation that I think she -- rather, pretty understandably didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to share.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just redact those?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You could.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We probably could, but I think at this point we\xe2\x80\x99ve shared as much of the letter that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to share at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one quick one.\xc2\xa0 Martin Indyk\xe2\x80\x99s resignation as the Mideast peace envoy -- I know his deputy has stepped up as an interim.\xc2\xa0 Will the President replace -- announce a full-time permanent replacement for that position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I actually would suggest that you check with my colleagues at the Department of State.\xc2\xa0 They may have a better sense of that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is certainly appreciative of all that Mr. Indyk has done in pursuit of trying to find a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done really important work.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s an expert in this area.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s returning to the Brookings Institution, but we anticipate that he will continue to be involved in this administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to try to resolve that situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have complete confidence in his deputy who is going to take over.\xc2\xa0 And this is a process in which the United States continues to be engaged.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe week ahead:<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President will welcome back to the White House Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.\xc2\xa0 The visit will highlight our close relationship with Chile and our strong partnership with the Bachelet administration on advancing peace and global security, social inclusion and free trade.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to consulting with President Bachelet on U.N. Security Council matters, other multilateral and regional issues, and ongoing negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well as on expanding educational exchanges and deepening our collaboration in the areas of energy, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will also participate.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a long meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the afternoon, the President will host a reception at the White House in recognition of LGBT Pride Month.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will also attend that reception.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will hold a Cabinet meeting and attend a couple of other meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will host top economists for lunch to discuss ways to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity, and improve the competitiveness of the American economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday [Thursday], the President will attend meetings at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Friday, the President and First Lady will celebrate the Fourth of July by hosting military heroes and their families for an Independence Day celebration with a barbeque, a concert, and a view of fireworks on the South Lawn.\xc2\xa0 Some White House staff and their families from across the administration will also attend this event for the concert and fireworks viewing.\xc2\xa0 The event will be streamed live at whitehouse.gov/live.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the economists?\xc2\xa0 This is the second recent lunch he\xe2\x80\x99s having with economists.\xc2\xa0 Is it the same group?\xc2\xa0 And what did he learn from the first one, and what does he hope to learn from this one?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a different group of economists.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President is always on the look for some outside-the-box ideas for ways that we can strengthen America\xe2\x80\x99s economic competitiveness and expand economic opportunity for the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, I think the President is looking forward to what he would describe as a pretty open-ended discussion.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s looking for people who are legitimate experts in this field to bring their ideas.\xc2\xa0 And the President has put forward a lot of good ideas already.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to push those ideas, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also not going to stop looking for new ideas, some outside-the-box ideas -- maybe even some ideas that might cause Republicans to drop their strident opposition to policies the President supports that could, again, move the country forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President is looking forward to the discussion.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect any major announcements out of the lunch, but I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to have the kind of conversation and to draw out the kinds of ideas that he thinks would be good for the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s these two recent meetings.\xc2\xa0 And I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for about a year or so, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall him having lunch with economists before.\xc2\xa0 Is there something about right now or the time that we\xe2\x80\x99re in right now that would cause him to look for these fresh ideas, these out-of-the-box ideas?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things about that.\xc2\xa0 Like most Americans, the President has lunch every day -- and we don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about who has lunch with him.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s part of it.\xc2\xa0 But the President has periodically over the course of his administration looked for opportunities to sit down with experts in a wide range of fields to talk to them about their ideas for the kinds of policies that would strengthen the country.\xc2\xa0 And this is just the latest example.\xc2\xa0 There is no one thing that has precipitated this series of meetings.\xc2\xa0 But the President really enjoyed the discussion that he had with economists a couple of weeks ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s really looking forward to next week\xe2\x80\x99s discussion as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:30 P.M.
