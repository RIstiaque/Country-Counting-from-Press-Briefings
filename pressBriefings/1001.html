Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:08 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to ask your forgiveness that I had to switch around the briefing schedule a couple times.\xc2\xa0 I actually have to be done at 1:45 p.m.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to move quickly through your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me begin with an announcement, or rather a statement.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, President Obama and Vice President Biden will host an In-Sourcing American Jobs Forum at the White House focused on the increasing trend of companies choosing to in-source jobs and invest in growing in the United States.\xc2\xa0 As part of the In-Sourcing American Jobs Forum, the President will meet with business leaders as well as experts on the topic to discuss why it\xe2\x80\x99s competitive to locate in the United States and what more can be done to work with companies to take similar steps to in-source American jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing that meeting, the President will deliver remarks to a group that will include leaders from the government and the private sector that are taking steps to encourage companies to in-source and invest in America.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon, Cabinet officials will host panel discussions with both small and large businesses and experts on in-sourcing and investing in America.\xc2\xa0 There will be over a dozen large and small businesses in attendance at the event that have made decisions to bring jobs to the United States and to increase their investments here.\xc2\xa0 They will attend the forum.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I go to the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple topics today.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get your updated reaction about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Iran has convicted and sentenced to death an American that Iran accuses of spying.\xc2\xa0 I know the White House has demanded his release, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what more the White House and perhaps specifically the President can do given that his life is on the line.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate that we have seen Iranian press reports that Mr. Hekmati has been sentenced to death by an Iranian court.\xc2\xa0 Our State Department is working through the Swiss protecting powers in Iran to confirm the veracity of those reports.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf true, we strongly condemn such a verdict and will work with our partners to convey our condemnation to the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 Allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was sent to Iran by the CIA are false.\xc2\xa0 The Iranian regime has a history, as you know, of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions and of holding innocent Americans for political reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe call upon the Iranian government to grant the Swiss protecting powers immediate access to Mr. Hekmati, grant him access to legal counsel and release him without delay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe State Department can give you more details on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but I mean the question still stands.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve call for his release, if true, and the reports appear to be true, so what more can do you do other than making these calls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean that\'s a broad question, Ben.\xc2\xa0 We are putting a great deal of pressure on Iran broadly because of its rogue behavior, if you will -- the fact that it won\xe2\x80\x99t live up to its international obligations with regards to its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Those actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in concert with our international partners have had a significant impact on Iran, on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 I believe it was just last week where the new sanctions when they went into effect had the impact of causing the Iranian currency to drop dramatically.\xc2\xa0 So we work with our partners as well as unilaterally to increase that pressure.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs regards this particular incident, we will work in the manner that I described to you to call upon Iran to release Mr. Hekmati immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say in a case like this that the administration would consider any option to try to intervene and protect him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speculate about that.\xc2\xa0 I think that we take this matter very seriously, and we are addressing it in the appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic.\xc2\xa0 Wednesday is apparently the 10th anniversary of the prison in Guantanamo Bay, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House says now to critics who point to this as a pretty clear broken promise.\xc2\xa0 The President had wanted to close that within a year.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened for a lot of the history that you know of.\xc2\xa0 And now it\xe2\x80\x99s like there\'s really no end in sight.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to the criticism that this is just a big, broken promise?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the commitment that the President has to closing Guantanamo Bay is as firm today as it was during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 We all are aware of the obstacles to getting that done as quickly as the President wanted to get it done, what they were and the fact that they continued to persist.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s commitment hasn\'t changed at all.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the right thing to do for our national security interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat has been an opinion shared not just by this President or members of this administration, but senior members of the military as well as this President\'s predecessor and the man he ran against for this office in the general election.\xc2\xa0 So we will continue to abide by that commitment and work towards its fulfillment.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\'re any closer to closing it than you were the day he took office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this is a process that faces obstacles that we\'re all aware of and we will continue to work through it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch any of the Republican debates this weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t speak with him about that.\xc2\xa0 I know because I know him that it\'s unlikely, not because they were debates, but because he tends to, when he is watching television, not watch news or politics but sports or movies.\xc2\xa0 So I will venture a guess and say no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the Republican field starts to narrow a little bit and as the frontrunner is gaining traction, how does -- what has the President said and what is the White House thinking about your own strategy in the next few months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, as you know there is a reelection campaign located in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 And this President is doing the things that he needs to do to prepare for his campaign, but his\xc2\xa0 -- the level of his engagement is relatively low now because he has work to do as President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is very focused on his number-one priority, which is doing everything he can as President, working with Congress or using his executive authority or working with the private sector, to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had some signs of improvement in the economy, some indications that the recovery is strengthening, but we are a long way from where we need to be as a country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President is focused on the initiatives that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward in the American Jobs Act, including the extension -- the full extension of the payroll tax cut, the full extension of unemployment insurance, working with Congress to fund infrastructure projects that will put construction workers back to work but also build the foundation for the economy that we need to be competitive in the 21st century, and doing the kinds of things that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do on Wednesday with this in-sourcing forum to work with the private sector to focus people\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the fact that America is a great place to invest; it\xe2\x80\x99s the right place for American companies to in-source, if you will, to bring their investments and jobs back to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99ll use every tool in the toolbox to do that.\xc2\xa0 The campaign, when it comes, in terms of his enhanced engagement, will consume more time at the appropriate time.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not now for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even if the two operations are separate, as they clearly are, aren\xe2\x80\x99t things like the nomination of Richard Cordray last week and even the in-sourcing event right now milestones for -- that will be used for the campaigning season as well for this President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s like saying that anything you do as President is inherently political.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is he is running for reelection to a political office, the presidency of the United States, and he will obviously have a lot to say about what has been accomplished during his time in office, and, even more so, what needs to be done in the ensuing four years and why he believes that he has the right vision for the country going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd having said that, his job is to be President.\xc2\xa0 His job is to do everything he can to help the American people as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression; to work with the private sector, work with Congress, use his executive authority, to grow the economy and create jobs; to make sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing everything he can as Commander-in-Chief to ensure the safety of the American people both here and abroad; to take the kinds of actions that allowed him to fulfill his promise to end the war in Iraq, as he did late last year; and to continue to draw down forces in Afghanistan, even as we step up our fight against al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll these things are part of his day job, and they\xe2\x80\x99re quite consuming.\xc2\xa0 And because he does not need to now, he is not engaging particularly aggressively in his reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 It\'s only January.\xc2\xa0 There is not a Republican nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t the recess appointment engaging on some level?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t remember -- I guess maybe you weren\'t here last week -- but the President recess-appointed Richard Cordray because Republicans refused -- despite overwhelming bipartisan support, overwhelming testaments to the fact that he is enormously qualified and the overwhelming need to have a consumer watchdog in place, the Republicans in the Senate refused to confirm him, refused to give him an up or down vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery day that there isn\'t -- or wasn\'t a consumer watchdog in that office was a day when Americans weren\'t protected from abuses by payday lenders, non-bank financial institutions, mortgage brokers, student loan providers.\xc2\xa0 So he insisted that he was not going to wait any longer to allow those Americans to be unprotected.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans who opposed that nomination almost to a person have said it\'s not because they have any problem with Richard Cordray, it\'s because they have a problem with the bureau itself. And our position is if they want to change the law, they should do that through the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 It is the law.\xc2\xa0 It was passed by Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tWall Street reform is absolutely essential given the kind of crisis we went through that contributed to the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And Richard Cordray needs to be on the job.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President made that appointment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around.\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 If I could come back to Iran for a moment, the sanctions that the President signed into law over the holiday are sort of requiring the U.S. to go to a lot of long-time allies and make the case that they should curtail purchases of Iranian oil.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, in the week or so that those sanctions have been in effect, what\'s the earlier response been from countries like China, South Korea, Japan?\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that at the end of this six-month period, you\'ll be able to go to Congress and say in each of these cases these countries have significantly reduced the amount of oil they buy from Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speak for other countries.\xc2\xa0 Our belief is that for these sanctions to be most effective, they need to be multilateral and have multilateral participation.\xc2\xa0 They need to be timed and phased in a way that avoids negative repercussions to international oil markets and in ways that might cause more damage to ourselves than to Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s why we worked so closely with Congress to ensure that the flexibility was there, to allow us to implement this legislation, to implement the sanctions in a way that had the most negative effect, if you will, on Iran, while protecting our international partners and protecting us from shocks in the oil markets.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re proceeding with that approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the risk of getting into the weeds a tiny bit, in order to go to Congress and ask for a waiver in any of these cases, the phraseology is you need to show that these countries are importing significantly less oil.\xc2\xa0 Can you be more precise?\xc2\xa0 What constitutes, in percentage terms, a significant decline in purchases of Iranian oil?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t be more precise.\xc2\xa0 I know that we believe strongly that the flexibility that is necessary for the President to implement this law effectively exists in the legislation.\xc2\xa0 We worked with Congress to make sure that was the case and we are now in the process of doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the way in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan\'s new ambassador to the U.S., Sherry Rehman, has arrived here.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, since November 26th, when there was another cross-border attack in which 26 Pakistani soldiers were killed, you had tension in relations between the U.S. and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the kind of cooperation you are receiving from Pakistan now after that incident?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, and I\'ve discussed from here on numerous occasions, we have an important relationship with Pakistan; we have a complicated relationship with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work on it, because it\'s in the interest of the American people and in the interest of American national security to do so.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on that for you, except to say that we are working with Pakistan precisely because it\'s in American national security interests to do so and we will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\'s a lot of interest in Jodi Kantor\'s book that\'s coming out tomorrow -- details tensions between the First Lady and some, well, former top aides to President Obama.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering what you think about her accounts in the book.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that books like these tend to overhype and sensationalize things and I think that\'s the case here.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is -- and I think this is depicted in the book -- the relationship between the President and the First Lady is incredibly strong; their commitment to each other, to their children, and to the reasons why this President ran for office is all very strong.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the First Lady is very focused on the issues that matter to her -- helping military families, fighting childhood obesity -- and she has done that remarkably well.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s reflected also in the book.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you make of the account that\'s getting so much attention that Robert Gibbs cursed the First Lady in a meeting with top White House aides?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that books like these generally over-sensationalize things.\xc2\xa0 I know some people groan a little bit when I do this, but I\'ve covered a couple of White Houses myself, and the fact of the matter is I\'ve been here all three years, although not in this position.\xc2\xa0 The atmosphere and collegiality here is much better than any of the White Houses I\'ve covered.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been the case from day one here and continues to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut these are high-pressure jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\'s always a lot at stake.\xc2\xa0 And the commitment the people show to the President, to the First Lady, and to the causes that brought them here is fierce.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes that intensity leads people to raise their voices or have sharp exchanges.\xc2\xa0 But the overall picture is one of remarkable collegiality and a genuine focus.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, I think you guys know this, too.\xc2\xa0 A lot of you have covered previous administrations, previous White Houses.\xc2\xa0 This is a remarkably harmonious place, given everything that\xe2\x80\x99s at stake and the enormity of the issues that are discussed and debated here every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just speak to the voracity of the Gibb\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into individual anecdotes from there.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll simply say that isolating one incident where there were sharp words, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate or not, doesn\'t reflect the overall atmosphere and tenor here, or doesn\'t make clear -- also doesn\'t make clear that in some cases these anecdotes -- what really is the focus here, which every individual at the senior level that I know is determined to work for the President, work for the First Lady, towards achieving the things that they set out to do when they came here in January of 2009.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I see every day.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I saw in my first two years in my other job.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a testimony to the commitment that the folks here have to these causes that we have this kind of relationship among ourselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ann.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow up to that?\xc2\xa0 In your three years here, has it been common for Mrs. Obama to express an interest in the West Wing policy?\xc2\xa0 Does she voice her concerns?\xc2\xa0 Has she --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think as the author of this book herself said just the other day, if not today, that, in fact, no.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady is very focused on the issues that matter dearly to her -- military families and the fight against childhood obesity. She\xe2\x80\x99s also very focused on raising her two children, and giving them an upbringing that is as normal as can be in these rather unusual circumstances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She was not unhappy with the loss of her -- upset about the loss of the Senate seat --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody who occupy -- who comes to work here who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t disappointed by a political loss, the one you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that she was personally.\xc2\xa0 She doesn\'t come to meetings in the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 But I think everybody had hoped for a different outcome to that race.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t the White House confirm at the time that Johnny Depp was here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is a perfect example of why -- it goes right to my first point about how these books take -- books like these take these things out of context.\xc2\xa0 A couple of outlets that I won\xe2\x80\x99t name reported that a secret party -- well, if it was secret, why did we invite the press in?\xc2\xa0 Why was there a pool report?\xc2\xa0 Why were there contemporaneous photographs?\xc2\xa0 This was an event --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was no pool report from the State Dining Room about Johnny Depp being there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a publicity event for the outside.\xc2\xa0 This was an event for military children and their families inside the White House, where the press came, photographs were taken.\xc2\xa0 It was contemporaneously known who was here.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s -- if we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to hide something by bringing in the press, we\xe2\x80\x99re not very good at it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I think as many people have said in the wake of those reports, it\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the kind of hype and sensationalizing that books like this do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the record, there\xe2\x80\x99s not one statement from this White House about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But again, the purpose wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to -- for any of these -- we do a lot of these things -- July 4th, other events here, including other events that are geared towards military families and their kids, where the purpose isn\xe2\x80\x99t to publicize them externally for you guys, but to have a nice event for them here, which is different from trying to hide anything.\xc2\xa0 Again, you don\'t bring the press in, you don\'t have photographs going out of here in real time if you\'re trying to keep something on the down low.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the focus of the event was on celebrating and giving a nice time to military families and their kids, and the event itself was overwhelmingly for children.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the allegation that the author is making indirectly is that the White House did deliberately keep Johnny Depp and just in general the Hollywood angle out of this because of the recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Then why were there pictures of Johnny Depp instantly available?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To who?\xc2\xa0 Because the media was not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, there were pictures --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- let into that part where Johnny Depp was, if I understand it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There were many, many people in the White House -- public and staff and others -- and there were photographs out there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, honestly, Ed, I mean, again, there are outlets that have reported this as a \xe2\x80\x9csecret\xe2\x80\x9d party, which is just silly. And it\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible reporting to suggest that, that you would have a pool report and the press at an event that\xe2\x80\x99s secret, and have it attended by hundreds if not thousands of people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the focus was on military families and their kids.\xc2\xa0 And it was not on publicity outside of here, it was on those who were invited.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you say the book is overhyped and sensationalized, including that anecdote, why did 33 people around this White House to include senior aides and cooperate with this author?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that happened before the book came out.\xc2\xa0 But we cooperate with all of you on the stories that you work on.\xc2\xa0 We give access to you, grant -- you get interviews.\xc2\xa0 Some of your stories turn out to accurately reflect what we know has happened here and some of them, in our view, don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily reflect that.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of our job, in the press shop here, is to work with folks -- working on broadcast reports, radio reports, print reports, book, prose, poems, short films -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Haiku.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Haiku.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 All that kind of stuff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of -- on the anecdote that Brianna was talking about, are you aware of Robert Gibbs apologizing to the First Lady about that?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President was upset about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 While I was at the White House I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in those meetings at that time and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on it.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that Robert is, as you know, focused on helping the President get reelected.\xc2\xa0 He is out there, every bit as much of the team and a member of the team now as he was back then.\xc2\xa0 And then I would just point you to what I said before about these are high-pressure jobs with a lot at stake.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, the overall story here is how collegial and harmonious and focused everyone is here on the task at hand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tStephen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to these attacks on the President by Republican candidates over Iran, saying that his policies, sanctions policies are feckless, weak and ineffective?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to those criticisms.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty clear about what our approach is to Iran. We have sanctions that are unprecedented, that are having demonstrable effect on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 Iran is isolated in a way that it\xe2\x80\x99s never been, and the pressure on Iran is significant and increasing.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work with our international partners to pressure Iran to change its behavior, to abide by its international obligations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think, stepping back, this President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to foreign policy, the successes he\xe2\x80\x99s had I think are pretty clear. So when that debate comes he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to engage in it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some more folks in the front row.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go back to the book -- sorry, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Has the President or the First Lady responded at all to this so far?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, what\xe2\x80\x99s the response to sort of the overarching theme in the book of the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s what seems to be unhappiness with her role or seemed to be back then, and what\xe2\x80\x99s described as living in a \xe2\x80\x9cbunker-like atmosphere\xe2\x80\x9d of the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you now to -- because obviously she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interviewed for this book, but she has given interviews and answered this question as recently as in the last few weeks about the remarkable privilege she feels she\xe2\x80\x99s been given to be First Lady and how she feels blessed by the opportunity to be First Lady.\xc2\xa0 So I would point you to the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s words to answer that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd broadly, I think you have to remember that the story here is of a husband and wife, a mother and father whose lives were enormously different five or six years ago from what they are and what they were when they came to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible transition that I think observers rightly point out has been done with remarkable grace and success in terms of the priorities that the President has set for himself and for the country, and in terms of the priorities that the First Lady has set for herself and for her family.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s my reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have they reacted personally to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 My guess is they both have a lot on their plate.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a story or two, but it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not something they\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend a lot of time reading.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, there are tons of books written about this White House, this administration, this President, this First Lady.\xc2\xa0 This is just another one of them.\xc2\xa0 So my guess is they stay focused on the things that matter most to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKate and then Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House doing to prepare for challenges from Congress -- for recess appointments?\xc2\xa0 What is the counsel\xe2\x80\x99s office doing?\xc2\xa0 Any conversations with members of Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations or meetings to report.\xc2\xa0 You know our position.\xc2\xa0 We feel very strongly about the legal foundation for the course of action the President took.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is -- and again, if you have any doubts, please head up to the Hill and check out for yourself -- Congress is in recess.\xc2\xa0 Chambers are empty.\xc2\xa0 The halls are quiet.</p>\n<p>\n\tSenate Republicans, despite overwhelming support across the country from Republicans and Democrats, attorneys general, decided to block this nominee and prevent middle-class Americans from having a watchdog looking out for their interests here in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLike I said before, financial institutions have a lot of well-paid lobbyists in Washington working with Congress to try to get their interests served.\xc2\xa0 The American people deserve, and this President believes they deserve, a consumer watchdog whose only job is to make sure that they\'re protected from abusive practices, and that\'s why the President took the action he did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect more recess appointments while Congress is in recess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements with regard to appointments to make today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also General Dempsey said the U.S. would take action to open the Strait of Hormuz if Iran closes it.\xc2\xa0 What kind of preparations -- I mean, what kind of action is he referring to specifically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Department of Defense for any specifics.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very confident in our capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Bill, yes.\xc2\xa0 Then Julia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the American prisoner in Iran.\xc2\xa0 You said that you\xe2\x80\x99d heard reports.\xc2\xa0 Do you not have any official word from the Swiss that he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working through the Swiss protecting powers to confirm those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that we doubt them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Swiss who represent us -- or with whom we work to represent us in Tehran in our dealings with the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no official word yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I just said.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Swiss to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This death sentence that he\xe2\x80\x99s reported to have received is subject, we understand, to confirmation by a larger supreme tribunal of some kind.\xc2\xa0 So will the U.S. be pushing to have it reversed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re pushing very clearly, as I just stated, that Iran release him.\xc2\xa0 I clearly stated, and others have, that the charges against him are false and we want to see him released.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the intricacies of the judicial process in Iran are not what interests us here.\xc2\xa0 Our interest is in seeing him released.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not CIA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Angela Merkel and Sarkozy met today to discuss the European debt crisis.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on the meeting?\xc2\xa0 Has he made any phone calls to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any phone calls to report.\xc2\xa0 He may have been briefed on it at his presidential daily briefing earlier today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that for sure, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with our European partners --the President does, Secretary Geithner does, others involved in this area do -- and we continue to monitor the progress that European leaders are making towards ensuring that the right measures are taken and are in place to stabilize that situation and bring it to a decisive conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given the current situation, how much concern is there in the administration that more European countries will see ratings agencies downgrade?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, our concern about the potential for that situation to worsen has been there and continues to be there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some progress by the Europeans.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s always a reminder in this case that we need to focus on the things that we have control over that can strengthen our economy, improve prospects for growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President will work with Congress to extend fully the payroll tax cut, to extend fully unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes to pass other measures of the American Jobs Act that will put people to work and grow our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou need that kind of insurance in a global economy like this because, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Europe or other shocks that we saw in the global economy last year -- the Arab Spring and its effect on oil prices, the earthquake and tsunami and its effect on global supply chains -- these are the kinds of things that you sometimes can\'t predict, or often can\'t predict, that have effects on the economy.\xc2\xa0 You need to do the things you can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s what the American people sent this President here to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the American people sent the members of Congress to Washington to do.\xc2\xa0 And I think that they need to focus on that challenge when those members of Congress return to Washington.\xc2\xa0 It would be I think a great gift to the American people if, upon reflection over the recess, members of Congress -- Republicans in particular -- decided that cooperation was the right way to go for the sake of the economy.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance without drama, without brinkmanship -- brinksmanship.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take up the measures in the American Jobs Act that have been left undone that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get that done for the American people. Let\xe2\x80\x99s show them that we can work together on their priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to -- let\xe2\x80\x99s do two more.\xc2\xa0 Julia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance for a year, has the President yet reached out to conferees before they return to Congress?\xc2\xa0 And what concessions specifically in relation to unemployment insurance might the President be willing to make?\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans did propose making some changes to unemployment insurance that would restrict those who qualified.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President put forward in his own proposal reforms to unemployment insurance, and I refer you to the American Jobs Act for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of overall concessions, let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear here.\xc2\xa0 These are things that the American people believe are necessary. These are things that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 This is a tax cut for 160 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 With regards to the unemployment insurance extension, economists across the board recognize that extending the unemployment insurance benefit is vital not just to the people who receive it but to the economy because that money is injected right into the economic bloodstream and has a significant impact on growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t think House Republicans are in a position if they\'re serious about growth and job creation to try to play politics with this.\xc2\xa0 We saw how that went not that long ago, and I think the American people would be extremely disappointed if that approach were taken again.\xc2\xa0 We can do this.\xc2\xa0 We can do it quickly and without drama, and we can move on to the other priorities that the American people have.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne more.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, North Korea announced yesterday that North Korea never, ever give up their nuclear programs.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specific response on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:41 P.M.
