EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you\xe2\x80\x99re joining us on our trip to Michigan today.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to talking about ways that our economy is rebounding growth in our manufacturing sector and especially in our automobile industry.</p>\n<p>With that I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What progress can you report from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting between the President and the Speaker?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that there was a meeting and that lines of communication remain open, but I cannot characterize the talks or conversations beyond that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any other one-on-one meetings on the schedule for this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t preview meetings or conversations.\xc2\xa0 Our interest here is to see if we can get a deal that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy, that makes sure that the middle class is protected, that their taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up, and it continues the growth and job creation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President any more or less confident of a deal being reached before the end of the year after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I won\xe2\x80\x99t characterize yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting or other conversations, but the President does believe that we can reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward a very detailed plan.\xc2\xa0 He has shown how he believes we need to achieve the necessary revenue targets in order to put together a large deal that would reflect the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that is so meaningful in terms of our long-term fiscal sustainability.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear in his detailed proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to enact cuts in our mandatory entitlement programs, including our health care programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen yet is any specificity at all from Republicans on revenue; we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a sentence on revenue.\xc2\xa0 And while there have been encouraging statements by individual lawmakers about the realization that rates will go up on the top 2 percent, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything specific from Republicans with regard to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as you know, a lot of people are watching this -- not just the taxpayers but the stock market, other countries even -- to see signs of American stability.\xc2\xa0 What is the harm in telling the public simply whether we\xe2\x80\x99re better off today than yesterday?\xc2\xa0 That kind of generic update on whether we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because our interest is in seeing if we can reach an agreement and not trying to negotiate an agreement through the media.\xc2\xa0 And I am entirely sympathetic to the interest that you have in this, but we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the prospects of getting an agreement to not read out the details of conversations that the President has with the Speaker, or other conversations that hopefully will make it possible to get an agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office said today, as you have, that the lines of communication are open, but also that they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to wait for the President to identify specific spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the need for Republicans to identify more details.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with the assessment that it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the White House to make the next move?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that the lines of communication are open.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the President met with the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 And we, broadly speaking, continue to engage in this process with important players and stakeholders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is we have put forward specific spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 The President is the only party that has put forward a plan that has specificity on both the spending and revenue side.\xc2\xa0 We have not seen in any detail from the Republicans, including from the offer that was put forward by the Speaker in his letter, the kind of detail that would allow us to assess the proposal.\xc2\xa0 To say, for example, on revenue that we can achieve $800 billion, which is far, far short of the necessary revenue for a comprehensive deal that achieves $4 trillion in deficit reduction, and to achieve that only through unnamed closures of loopholes and unnamed reductions to caps and deductions -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really get you very far.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you considering making a counter offer to the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s offer?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having.\xc2\xa0 I can only say that the President believes that a deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 It requires acceptance and acknowledgement in a concrete way by Republicans that the top 2 percent will see an increase in their rates.\xc2\xa0 To do that, all that Republicans in the House have to do is vote for a tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts for the top 2 percent, not a vote to -- a proactive vote to hike taxes on anyone.\xc2\xa0 What we are asking is that Republicans in the House follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and approve tax cuts for the middle class, for 98 percent of the American people -- something they say they believe is the right thing to do, the President believes is the right thing to do, the American public overwhelmingly believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 Economists believe that tax cuts for the middle class are the most beneficial to the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s get that done as a demonstration that Washington can work, even as we grapple with some of these other issues that we need to resolve in order to achieve a broader agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, will the President weigh in on the Michigan right-to-work case while he\xe2\x80\x99s here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming soon.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the so-called right-to-work laws is well known.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I won\xe2\x80\x99t preview his remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Speaker repeated what some others have said, that the President is slow-walking this, trying to build pressure on the Republicans and wants it to get up to the last minute.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we have yet to see more than a sentence of specificity from the Republicans on the issue of revenue.\xc2\xa0 There is no deal without acknowledgment and acceptance of the fact that rates are going up on top earners.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I would say.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the President has made clear he\xe2\x80\x99s eager to get a deal and he believes that a deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also made clear that when it comes to a large deal on the order of magnitude of $4 trillion, that tough choices would have to be made by both sides, and he knows that he would not get everything that he wants.\xc2\xa0 He knows that not every detail of his proposal would make it through such an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make tough choices, as he has in the past.</p>\n<p>But Republicans have to recognize that we cannot afford, the public does not support, and it is economically a bad idea to extend tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and those making over $250,000.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President think there\xe2\x80\x99s any real risk to either the economy or to consumer confidence if this debate runs right up against -- right up to New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve?\xc2\xa0 Or as long as you get it done before January 1, is that okay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to create a situation where I\xe2\x80\x99m naming a deadline, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 The tax cuts\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as long as it gets done on time, is that sufficient?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s market analysis that I can\'t do.\xc2\xa0 The sooner we get a deal the better.\xc2\xa0 The reason why we\'re in this situation is we have very specific deadlines.\xc2\xa0 Taxes go up on everybody on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 Automatic, across-the-board spending cuts begin to take effect on January 1st if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act in either of these cases.</p>\n<p>So those are the deadlines we face, and the sooner we reach an agreement the better.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New topic.\xc2\xa0 There is a very important \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d meeting this week, as you know, in Morocco.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has been moving in the direction of helping to build up the Syrian opposition, and there has been a lot of talk that maybe this is the moment for the United States to formally recognize the opposition.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House\'s view on that?\xc2\xa0 And do you believe that the time has come to recognize the opposition, and would that be an important step to resolving the terrible situation in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re absolutely right that we\'ve done a lot of work with our international partners in assisting the opposition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve provided substantial humanitarian and non-lethal aid to the Syrian people and to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We applauded and continue to work with -- we applauded the creation of and continue to work with the Syrian Opposition Council and consider it an important representative of the Syrian opposition.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any previews for you of the meeting that you mention, which is important, except to say that we continue to be committed to the proposition that Syria\'s future needs to be decided by the Syrian people; that that future cannot include Bashar al Assad, who is a tyrant with an enormous amount of blood on his hands -- the blood of his own people.\xc2\xa0 And we have noted -- I did last week -- that some of the progress that the opposition has been making, but this conflict needs to end for the sake of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to the family of the SEAL team member that had been killed in the raid?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of any conversations of the President.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw the statement from the President, but I have no more information for you on the death of a Special Forces operative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick one on the trip today.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the connection between where we\'re headed, the President\'s comments today, and the need to get a deal done on the fiscal cliff?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- again, without previewing his comments, remains focused on his number-one priority, which is helping this economy grow, making the kind of decisions that enable it to grow and enable it to create jobs.</p>\n<p>And the automobile industry is an important piece of that policy approach, and he took steps, as you know, early on in his administration to ensure that the American automobile industry survived.\xc2\xa0 And it has been the rebound of the big American automakers that has helped fuel real progress in the manufacturing sector in this economy.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing that progress, and I think that\'s what this trip will highlight.</p>\n<p>Broadly, though, this is all of a piece.\xc2\xa0 When we talk about the need to reach a big deal that achieves $4 trillion in deficit reduction, that\'s not because deficit reduction is an inherent good; it\xe2\x80\x99s because done right, done well, coupled with measures that ensure that we continue to grow, inclusive of measures that protect the middle class, large-scale deficit reduction serves the broader purpose, which is economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President seeks it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all of a piece for him.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why he ran for office.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why he ran for reelection.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one question about the facility we\xe2\x80\x99re going to?\xc2\xa0 The Daimler company, as you know, in addition to owning Detroit Diesel, used to own Chrysler, and they sold it in 2007 to effectively a hedge fund, and that led to a very dark period in Chrysler\xe2\x80\x99s history that was really only redeemed after the federal bailout under the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering about the symbolism of going to a Daimler-owned facility given Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s rather checkered history in Detroit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a particularly happy story.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that what the President is interested in, the growth -- the revival and growth of the American automobile industry, the manufacture of automobiles here in the United States, which means good jobs for American workers.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s the focus that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of one company\xe2\x80\x99s past, I don\'t really have a comment on that.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the present and the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President getting any closer to deciding who he wants at the State Department and Defense Department?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the opportunity to say that I have no personnel announcements to make today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You bet.\xc2\xa0 Good to see all of you.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:01 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
