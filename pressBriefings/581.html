SAST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we begin our flight back to the United States from South Africa.\xc2\xa0 With me again today is Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.\xc2\xa0 Ben can best answer questions you might have about today\xe2\x80\x99s event and the President\xe2\x80\x99s role in it, including his speech.\xc2\xa0 And I can take your questions on other subjects, but let me turn it over to Ben to start; he can give you a little bit of a laydown on today\xe2\x80\x99s events.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, clearly this was a very personal and important moment for the President to be able to speak at the memorial service for one of his true heroes.\xc2\xa0 He was working on the remarks throughout both legs of our flight over here, and I think you see that they reflect both the impact that he believes Nelson Mandela had on the world, but also the impact that Nelson Mandela had on him personally.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0But the President also really wanted to underscore the point that our role is to draw from the example of Nelson Mandela, both in our own lives and in dealing with the issues of the day.\xc2\xa0 And he was overwhelmed by the reception he got from the audience at the event, even in very difficult inclement weather, and enjoyed his time with the Mandela family and was able to speak to a number of foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did he meet with the Mandela family?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He saw them there at the event.\xc2\xa0 So he saw Gra\xc3\xa7a Machel and a number of the members of the Mandela family and spoke to them at the event, expressed his condolences on behalf of the American people; indicated he looked forward to seeing them in the future if they made it to Washington or if he returns to South Africa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The handshake with Raul Castro, was that by happenstance or was it planned, and what did they talk about?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Nothing was planned in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s role other than his remarks.\xc2\xa0 So the rest of it, of course, was simply his presence at the ceremony.</p>\n<p>He was focused above all on paying tribute to Nelson Mandela.\xc2\xa0 When he went to the podium, he shook hands with everybody on his way to speak.\xc2\xa0 He really didn\'t do more than exchange greetings with those leaders on his way to speak; it wasn\'t a substantive discussion.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus was on honoring the legacy of Nelson Mandela, as was the case with many leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what other world leaders he spoke to?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned a few there, you said there were a few.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, he sat with Prime Minister Cameron, with the Prime Minister of Denmark.\xc2\xa0 He saw a number of African leaders, President Kenyatta among them.\xc2\xa0 He exchanged greetings with President Karzai, but they did not have a extended discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there were -- he was basically able to greet most of the leaders who were there in the box, but did not have bilateral, substantive discussions really; more just reflecting on Nelson Mandela and discussing the event.\xc2\xa0 The one person he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to see at the event that he wanted to was Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\xc2\xa0 So after the event, when we got back to the hotel -- or when he got back to the hotel, he called Desmond Tutu, thanked him for everything that he\xe2\x80\x99s done of course over the years, and expressed his respect for the role that the Archbishop played alongside Nelson Mandela in so many struggles of the last half century.\xc2\xa0 And Mrs. Obama was able to speak to Archbishop Tutu as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that he did have some interaction with Dilma Rousseff, and it looked sort of warm, was that, again, just totally, like, superficial hello, or did they get to talk at all?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think they spoke, but, again, not in depth.\xc2\xa0 But I think he feels he has a warm relationship with Dilma Rousseff, that it can clearly weather the differences we\xe2\x80\x99ve had over the surveillance issues.\xc2\xa0 We have a very substantial dialogue through diplomatic and intelligence channels to work through the Brazilian concerns, and he\xe2\x80\x99s confident he can have that relationship on a firm footing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he reach any progress on getting her to the United States for a visit based on today\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think they discussed that, that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think sort of the press sort of surrounding the handshake with Castro, does the White House think it\xe2\x80\x99s blown out of proportion?\xc2\xa0 Are you surprised by it?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously we recognize that it\xe2\x80\x99s been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.\xc2\xa0 I think, though, that what people need to remember is what today was about was Nelson Mandela, one of the giants of the 20th century, a person who we will most likely never share this Earth with his caliber again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so that\xe2\x80\x99s where the focus should be; that\xe2\x80\x99s where the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus was -- not on any other political or policy matter.\xc2\xa0 He was focused on President Mandela.\xc2\xa0 And of course, I think when you have a life as broad and sweeping as Nelson Mandela, you draw people from all over the world who have had relationships with the South African government, with the ANC.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think where people need to be focused is on saying goodbye to someone who did so much to change the course of history and leave the world a better place.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really the headline of the day as far as we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, can I ask a question about the speech itself?\xc2\xa0 The President talked about some supporters of Nelson Mandela through the years having, in his view, a complicated record of living up to some of the things that the President said Mandela stood for, some of the other foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t talk so much about the complicated record the U.S. had in respect to the apartheid government.\xc2\xa0 Is there some reason that he didn\'t get into those issues at all?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s implicit what President Obama references his own activism was against the policy of the United States government in the 1980s to support the apartheid regime.\xc2\xa0 And when he spoke in Cape Town, he was very clear that he felt that, once again, that was the wrong policy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what stirred him into action -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just support for Nelson Mandela, it was seeking to press the United States and other governments to sanction the apartheid regime.\xc2\xa0 So I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s built into the activism that he spoke about and is well understood by the audience here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think as it relates to the challenge that he put at the end, it was in three areas.\xc2\xa0 One, again, people who embrace the legacy of racial reconciliation but aren\xe2\x80\x99t combating the economic inequality that continues to divide people not just in South Africa but in the United States and around the world.\xc2\xa0 Second, people who embrace the liberation movements but then do not live up to those values within their own countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And one important point that the President made in his speech today and when he was here earlier in the summer is that Nelson Mandela gave up power.\xc2\xa0 And part of what makes him so extraordinary is he was a liberation leader who took office as President, which is rare enough, but then he relinquished power to his successor in a democratic transition.\xc2\xa0 That is the type of leadership that the President seeks to support around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t obviously name any names when he went through that section, but was there any country or leaders in particular that he had in mind as he was writing that section?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think his intent was to single out specific countries.\xc2\xa0 However, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear which countries do not value the political dissent that he spoke about, and do not carry out the democratic transitions that he spoke about.\xc2\xa0 If you look in the neighborhood, for instance, you certainly see examples of leaders who may have been on the right side of some of the movements for opposing apartheid and supporting independence for nations in the 20th century, who then did not necessarily follow through by living those values once they took office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he use the opportunity of seeing Karzai to bring up the bilateral security agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t see this as a venue to do business.\xc2\xa0 He wanted it to be focused on celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela and saying goodbye.\xc2\xa0 The other point there, though, is that we have an agreement that we are comfortable with, that we negotiated with the Afghans, that the loya jirga in Afghanistan has welcomed and embraced.\xc2\xa0 And so our position continues to be that this is in the best interest of the United States and Afghanistan, and President Karzai should move toward signature of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just for the record, Alan Gross didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in the conversation with Castro, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, again, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- as those of you who saw, I think it was just an exchange of greetings as he was making his way through the podium up to speak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to try to move toward a different sort of relationship with Cuba anyway?\xc2\xa0 And in terms of talking about honoring Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela for years, dating back to the Clinton administration, was part of the United States to relax its approach to Cuba and do it in a different way.\xc2\xa0 And can you talk about that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, as a general matter, we have taken a different approach in some important respects in relation to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The President lifted the prohibition on family travel and remittances.\xc2\xa0 He increased licensing for travel and engagement with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we continue to have the same grave concerns about both the human rights situation in Cuba and Alan Gross, who we believe should be released immediately so he can return to his family.</p>\n<p>So we will continue to explore the types of openings that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already undertaken, and the President has indicated a willingness to pursue different paths.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we would very much focus our policy on supporting greater human rights dignity and opportunity for the people of Cuba that would certainly be in line with the types of values that the President spoke about today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, there were a lot of leaders up there.\xc2\xa0 Was the President aware that it was Raul Castro when he shook hands with him?\xc2\xa0 Or were people just thrusting their hands at him?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he was aware that that was Raul Castro.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It appeared that some people in the crowd actually booed Zuma, President Zuma, when he spoke.\xc2\xa0 Given that the President thought it was a venue and a day for honoring Nelson Mandela, did he have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first of all, one of the great things about coming to South Africa is you see the enormous demonstrative nature of the crowd -- they dance, they sing, they cheer, they express every type of emotion.\xc2\xa0 It certainly makes for a very energetic event, even in very bad weather.</p>\n<p>I think with respect to President Zuma, he of course can rightly claim his role in the struggle alongside Nelson Mandela to fight apartheid.\xc2\xa0 He currently is a politician and a political leader in a democratic South Africa.\xc2\xa0 And there are clearly always going to be political differences in a democracy -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think one of the legacies of Nelson Mandela is that people in South Africa can express however they feel about their government without any fear, and I think that should be welcomed.\xc2\xa0 And that is a legacy of what Mandela and the ANC and so many other leaders brought about in overturning apartheid.</p>\n<p>I should have noted earlier that among the other leaders --and you may have seen this -- the President was able -- he saw former President de Klerk as well, exchanged greetings with him, obviously speaking to the negotiations two decades ago that led to the end of the Apartheid regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he see Hollande or Sarkozy?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 What?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hollande or Sarkozy?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Marvin said he ran into Hollande.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he saw Sarkozy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did see Hollande?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And they had a brief encounter.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And I know he said he saw some of the former British prime ministers -- Tony Blair and some of the other former British prime ministers who were there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any substance in the talk with Kenyatta?\xc2\xa0 I mean, even the fact it happened given his legal situation seems interesting.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that they were -- he has spoken to President Kenyatta on the phone obviously about -- in the past about both the fire at the airport and the al-Shabaab attack.\xc2\xa0 So it was not the first time they\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken.\xc2\xa0 I think they spoke about Kenya, which is obviously a country that the President knows well.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they had any more substantive exchange in that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he see President Carter -- former President Carter?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he did.\xc2\xa0 The Elders were sitting in a different area, which is why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Bishop Tutu either.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he saw President Carter.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he spent a good amount of time with former President Bush and Clinton as well as Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is Hillary Clinton on the flight back?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 The Clintons are all traveling together back to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are the same folks who were on the plane on the way over -- also the Cabinet members and senior staff?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have President and Mrs. Bush.\xc2\xa0 Is the Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the Attorney General is with us.\xc2\xa0 Susan Rice, Tina Tchen, Valerie Jarrett.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it, right?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick anybody up.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick anybody up, you and I.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any more information on who might attend the funeral as U.S. delegation?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, but we will get you that in the next couple days.\xc2\xa0 We are focused on the Qunu event, and expect that there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a number of people there.\xc2\xa0 And a number of members of Congress I think did make the event today.\xc2\xa0 It is worth noting the role that the -- in particular that the Congressional Black Caucus played for many years in opposing apartheid.\xc2\xa0 And many of those same people were able to be here today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he expected to do any business on the flight back?\xc2\xa0 Any foreign leader calls -- anything?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Messages to foreign countries?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s anything like that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s having dinner now -- he and the First Lady are having dinner with President and Mrs. Bush.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask where?\xc2\xa0 Where are they dining together -- in the conference room?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Conference room.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And Valerie Jarrett, Tina Tchen, Susan Rice and the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are all at dinner also?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all in the conference room having dinner, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk about the John Podesta move?\xc2\xa0 What is his job supposed to be?\xc2\xa0 Should we see this as part of a staff makeover or shakeup?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that John Podesta will be joining the White House staff as a counselor to the President.\xc2\xa0 John, as you know, has an enormous amount of experience and he has dedicated his career to a goal that he shares with the President, which is improving the lives of middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>John was a chief of staff to former President Clinton.\xc2\xa0 He was also transition head for President-elect Obama, and has served as an informal advisor to President Obama over the years as well as to the Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, whose idea it was to bring in John in this role for one year --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One year only.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the agreement.</p>\n<p>And he will advise on a range of issues with a particular focus on issues of energy and climate change, but will obviously bring a lot of experience to bear on behalf of the President and Denis.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to having him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we have a start date on him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a start date for you.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s roughly the calendar year is the agreed-upon time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there some reason for that?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of unusual to announce a timeframe.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important year.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he only willing to stay for a year?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out why we already --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is what Denis and John agreed on.\xc2\xa0 And I know that Denis and the President are looking forward to having John\xe2\x80\x99s counsel as we deal with the many issues that we have on our plate including implementation of the Affordable Care Act; including moving forward on the President\xe2\x80\x99s climate action plan; pressing forward, as John did as chief of staff to President Clinton, on executive actions where necessary when we can\xe2\x80\x99t get cooperation out of Congress to help advance an agenda that helps the middle class thrive, the economy grow and addresses some of the issues that the President talked about in his speech the other day in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And whose phone was it that the selfie was taken on between Obama, Cameron and the Prime Minister of Denmark?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to get a readout out from the dinner?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a social dinner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bring them over here.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President and Mrs. Obama have been very glad to host former President Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush, as well as Secretary Clinton on the flight out here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a nice time for everybody to share together.\xc2\xa0 And for some of us -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at Steve Holland here -- some of us who covered President Bush, it\xe2\x80\x99s been fun to have him onboard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it was fun for all of us.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>END&lt; br /&gt; 8:21 P.M SAST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
