GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, fire away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Boehner has come out with a proposal that would freeze taxes at their current level and put spending at 2008 levels.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you can at least work with?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Congressman Boehner on many, many occasions talk about making the tax cuts for the upper end, for the wealthy, permanent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his plan, and I think that continues to be his plan.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear the President talk about the fact that giving a $100,000 tax break to a millionaire, at a cost of $700 million for 10 years, that\xe2\x80\x99s not getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will talk about today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, I continue -- I saw part of what Congressman Boehner said on TV.\xc2\xa0 My question, I guess, for him is, are they abandoning the permanent or are they going to -- are they just doing a two-year proposal?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him say permanent so many times I tend to believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s working off of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President willing to compromise at all on the tax cuts?\xc2\xa0 There seems to be some question.\xc2\xa0 On the upper-income tax cuts, would he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with the President since he ran for the Senate in 2004 and we were asked if we supported the middle-class cuts in 2004, and the President said yes.\xc2\xa0 Our position has been -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this for many months -- and that is keep the tax cuts for the middle class who are struggling in this economy and, quite frankly, were struggling before the economy collapsed in September of 2008.\xc2\xa0 Their wages had gone down; their hours had gone up for many, many years.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss that today.</p>\n<p>But we are facing a budget deficit that is not going to be fixed by handing out $700 billion to the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is -- what?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our position is tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Theirs is tax cuts for millionaires.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there any talk of maybe moving that upper limit up from $250,000?\xc2\xa0 People have thrown out $500,000.\xc2\xa0 Is that something you guys are even discussing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- some Hill Democrats who are advocating spending -- making that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anybody is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anybody at the White House has talked to anybody up on the Hill today.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this has been clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction from the White House to the BP report?\xc2\xa0 It seems like they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to put a lot of the blame for the spill on a lot of other companies.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the report and there\xe2\x80\x99s an active, ongoing investigation as to what went wrong that day in April.\xc2\xa0 Our focus is on finding out -- and again, I talked about this yesterday -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- the blowout preventer is now -- we have the ability to look at it, add that to part of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 And our job is to find out what went wrong and hold those responsible accountable for the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been done, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the administration will do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rahm for mayor?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you signing up?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You know, I think many of you saw what David said on the morning shows.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, something like that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come around a lot.\xc2\xa0 Mayor Daley has been there since 1989.\xc2\xa0 And I presume that Rahm will take some time and make a decision about that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that he was -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a job he\xe2\x80\x99s been interested in.</p>\n<p>I will say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not from Chicago, but having spent a lot of time there over the past seven or eight years, it\xe2\x80\x99s a city you can fall in love with very quickly.\xc2\xa0 But secondly I would say, our day ends with and begins with a meeting in Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 We had that meeting yesterday and we were focused on a series of things that lie in front of us, and started it at 7:30 a.m. this morning with the same meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think Rahm right now is focused on the enormous number of tasks that we have in front of us as an administration.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future, but I think his focus right now is on his job as chief of staff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to the President about it, or to you about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I don\'t know the answer to the second --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you expect -- Rahm may leave, the midterm elections are coming up, people are exhausted, it might be a natural time for some staff turnover.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect that after the midterms?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say -- look, I think -- I do not think it is surprising that that is a time in which people who have given two years of service return to things that they were doing beforehand.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that that will happen in -- it will happen in this administration like it has in many of the previous.</p>\n<p>I will say, too, for those that were on the campaign, this is sort of the end of year four, not necessarily the end of year two.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there will be people that return to their lives and their families and -- but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a while before that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got at least two months before this election -- or about two months before this election before we get to a lot of those decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Bennet of Colorado is quoted in The Hill as opposing the $50 billion infrastructure measure that the President rolled out a couple days ago.\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on that, and do you have any concern about holding Democrats together on that portion of the package?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I honestly did not see the article.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his reasoning was.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for an increase in infrastructure investment has to do with the fact that 20 percent of those that are unemployed used to be employed -- they\xe2\x80\x99re skilled labor and used to be employed in the construction industry.\xc2\xa0 But because of the housing boom, the demand for new houses is not nearly as great, and you find a lot of these people who -- a lot of these workers who can\xe2\x80\x99t find the skilled labor that they\xe2\x80\x99re used to doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s a long-term proposal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about investing in not just skilled labor but investing in rebuilding America.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have -- I think if you look at the number of people that over the course of the past two years have said they support more infrastructure spending, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d find the vast majority of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The question is whether or not we can get things done because people are willing to move forward rather than play games.</p>\n<p>All right, guys?\xc2\xa0 Get buckled up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:19 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
