EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\'s anybody who made the trek back from Seoul and showed up -- oh, there\'s one in the back. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just for you, Josh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in your -- I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 I take that as a compliment.\xc2\xa0 I think on your body clock it\'s probably like 4 in the morning, so good evening to you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon to the rest of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, I do have a brief announcement.\xc2\xa0 The President will sign both the Stock Act and the startup bill at separate signing ceremonies here at the White House next week.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more details on timing and logistics around those ceremonies in the coming days, but you should know that the bipartisan members who played a role in getting these bills to the President\'s desk will be invited to attend the ceremonies.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s something to look forward to.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a week ahead on Wednesday, so take the early thing there. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, Ken, do you want to get us started?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Josh, there\'s been a lot of focus on the health care arguments before the Supreme Court the last few days.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned that the entire health care law may be in jeopardy, and, more specifically, the individual mandate portion of the law?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ken, I can tell you that the administration remains confident that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons for that is because the individual provision -- individual responsibility provision that you cite was originally a Republican idea. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a novel, policy solution that was conceived of by the Heritage Foundation, was promoted by conservative Republicans in Washington D.C. as a solution to difficult health care challenges, and it was an idea that was put forward as the central part of the plan that was advanced by the Republican governor of Massachusetts, who put in place his own health care reform proposal.\xc2\xa0 So the Affordable Care Act is a bipartisan plan, and it\'s one that we believe is constitutional. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think, though, that some of the questions that were raised in the oral argument could be indicative of where the justices are leaning in this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Anybody who has -- believes that you can try to predict the outcome of a Supreme Court case based solely on the questions of the justices is not a very good student of the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there have been lower court cases on this very issue, on the Affordable Care Act, where conservative judges have posed difficult, tough questions to Department of Justice lawyers.\xc2\xa0 And at least in a couple of those cases, these conservative judges, despite their tough questions, ended up ruling -- ended up upholding the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m referring of course to Judges Sutton and Silberman. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I would caution against anyone to try to make predictions about the outcome of this case based solely on the tenor of the questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a separate topic -- oil prices are down about 2 percent today amid reports that there may be a release of oil reserves.\xc2\xa0 France\xe2\x80\x99s government said that the U.S. asked it to consider releasing oil from its strategic reserves.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could comment on that report, and whether there could be plans underway to release strategic reserves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports, Ken.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you, though.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as we have said repeatedly, while this is an option that remains on the table, no decisions have been made and no specific actions have been proposed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the administration saying that they have not contacted France about this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it should be no surprise that on a whole range of energy issues -- I mean, this -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through great pains to describe from this podium and from other places -- the challenges that are posed by the volatile gas prices is a global phenomenon.\xc2\xa0 And so, it should be no surprise to you that the Obama administration, particularly folks at the State Department and others, have been in contact with their counterparts to talk about trying to address this challenge. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to specific actions, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up on both of those topics. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with energy.\xc2\xa0 Without confirming your talks with France, Germany also responded to these reports today and said that they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is appropriate or that the conditions are there for a strategic oil release.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern to the administration as you\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing these options?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, we are coordinating with our partners around the globe to confront the global phenomenon that is the volatility in the energy markets right now.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- any specific guidance for you on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve other than to tell you something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s an option on the table. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But anybody who tries to convince you -- in this government or any other government, frankly -- that specific decisions have been made or actions have been proposed is not speaking accurately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even if decisions haven\xe2\x80\x99t been made, clearly if it\xe2\x80\x99s an option on the table you need to build up some support for it.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like you have enough support, at least from some countries, to make it a viable option.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position, from this podium, to read out the details of the kinds of conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having on this particular topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One follow up on health care.\xc2\xa0 James Carville said yesterday that if the court did strike down the law, that that would politically actually be a winner for Democrats going into the election.\xc2\xa0 Do you share that assessment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Carville has the freedom to make those kinds of political assessments from television studios and from other places.\xc2\xa0 And there are many other people in Washington, D.C. who also avail themselves to the opportunity to draw some political connections.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to do that from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The policy that Mr. Verrilli has been defending before the Supreme Court is a policy -- is a bill, the Affordable Care Act, that was passed by a majority of the House, that was passed by a majority of the Senate, and was signed into law by the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And there are people all across the country who are enjoying the benefits of that legislation\xe2\x80\x99s passage already. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are 2.5 million young adults who have health insurance on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There are 5.1 million seniors on Medicare who have saved more than $3 billion on their prescription drug costs.\xc2\xa0 We are already seeing consumer protections being put in place that will reign in the power and the authority of insurance companies to take advantage of patients. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on are the benefits of this piece of legislation and implementing this bill -- all the provisions of this bill -- so that we can maximize for the American people the benefits of this piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of people who are willing to talk about the politics.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is putting in place a policy that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a tangible difference in the lives of people all across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jessica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning, the White House Counsel put out a statement describing Solicitor General Verrilli as \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinarily talented advocate who ably and skillfully represented the U.S. before the court.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why did the White House feel the need to put out a statement defending the Solicitor General?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because somebody asked.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t always put out statements to everything -- in response to everything we ask.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You\'d be very busy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me now.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that -- as I was thinking about getting this question today -- that it is a little bit ironic that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking somebody who is standing behind a podium answering tough questions from people on the record about the performance of somebody else who is standing behind a podium asking tough questions on the record on a difficult issue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is, is that staff at the White House agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments that were described by Ms. Ruemmler today.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Verrilli is a very talented advocate and a skilled lawyer; he\'s one of the brightest legal minds in Washington D.C.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve had complete confidence in his performance before the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President listened to any of the audio from the Supreme Court proceedings, and does he feel like he has the best person representing this case?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President was on a plane most of the day yesterday coming back from Seoul.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not he has listened to the actual audio recordings of the case.\xc2\xa0 He has been kept apprised of the case by reading news reports and by talking to his staff. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that the takeaway from the arguments of the last couple of days, that many of us at the White House here have concluded, is that Mr. Verrilli isn\'t just an effective advocate for the Obama administration, but he\'s also an effective advocate for the 5.1 million seniors that have saved $3.1, $3.2 billion in their prescription drug costs.\xc2\xa0 He\'s somebody who isn\'t an advocate for the government; he\'s an advocate for the 54 million Americans who have enjoyed free preventative care through their private insurance because of the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the reason that the President worked so hard to pass health care reform by working with Congress to pass it through the House, to pass it through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And these are the principles that we\'re focused on as we implement the bill moving forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a quick one on Syria?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Syrians have agreed to Kofi Annan\'s peace plan.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if in any way this deters the -- if this encourages the White House or changes the President\'s view that Assad must go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not change that view.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve heard promises from the Assad regime before.\xc2\xa0 And we will judge the Assad regime on their actions, not on their comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you can answer some of the questions that Mr. Verrilli didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be able to satisfy the justices with yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is health care so special that requiring people to buy health insurance is a good idea?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything this administration would ask Americans to buy, from cell phones to broccoli?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to weigh in from here, Ann.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Verrilli is a very skilled advocate.\xc2\xa0 I assume that -- he certainly is one of the brightest legal minds in Washington D.C.\xc2\xa0 I assume he did very well in law school; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even do very well on the LSAT.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put up my legal analysis against his, frankly because I think that he did an extraordinarily good job of representing the opinion of the government on that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why, then, the President has this confidence that the entire law and the mandate will be upheld?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I referred to it in my earlier answer to Ken\'s question, which is that this is originally a Republican idea.\xc2\xa0 Republicans, at one point in time, certainly thought the individual response --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why -- so it\'s a Republican idea.\xc2\xa0 But why does that remain to get constitutional?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\'m merely citing that there are plenty of Republicans who at least one point in their career advocated this decision.\xc2\xa0 I assume that one of the reasons they did that was because they thought it was a constitutional decision, or a constitutional way to lower costs and to expand access to health insurance for people all across the country.\xc2\xa0 That is what this has achieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, I would caution you and others about interpreting, or assuming that they can predict the outcome in this case based solely on the tenor of the questions from the justices on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a risky path to go down, if you\'re placing bets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean there\'s still no work here on what if, if the mandate would be overturned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on implementing the bill -- and all of the provisions of the bill -- so that we can make sure that we maximize the benefits on behalf of the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Christi. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Does the President view Russia as the big geopolitical foe to the U.S.?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Christi, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a foreign policy expert to know that the Cold War ended 20 years ago, and that the greatest threat that the President has been fighting on behalf of the American people is the threat posed by al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are also significant threats that are posed by nations like Iran and North Korea that have failed to live up to their international obligations when it comes to nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the irony is, is that Russia -- particularly in the cases of North Korea and Iran -- have worked very well with the international community to isolate those two regimes and to seek a diplomatic solution to hold those two regimes accountable for living up to their international obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who does the U.S. view as a geopolitical foe then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the one that I cited was al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the President has been focused on disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan, but all across the globe.\xc2\xa0 And certainly our men and women in uniform have been on the front lines of that effort, and many of them have borne a significant burden in the progress that we\'ve made on that front. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Certainly the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by Iran and North Korea -- their unwillingness to live up to international obligations when it comes to nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has worked aggressively with our international partners, with people all across -- with countries all around the globe to isolate those regimes, to hold them accountable for flouting their international obligations, and to seek a diplomatic path to resolving those differences of opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President surprised to hear Speaker Boehner say that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t criticize the President when he\'s traveling overseas?\xc2\xa0 What did he think of that remark?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are two things about this.\xc2\xa0 One is the individual responsibility provision was something that was conceived of by the Heritage Foundation.\xc2\xa0 It was a provision that was aggressively advocated by conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., and it was something that is -- that was central to the health care reform initiative that was put in place by the Republican governor of Massachusetts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it seems to me that there are probably plenty of Republicans that agree that this is a helpful solution to this policy challenge.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of talking about the benefits of the health care reform law, we look forward to having that debate with the critics.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to shy away from.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has a record to stand on.\xc2\xa0 The President has a record that includes 5 million seniors getting help affording their prescription drug coverage, saving them $3 billion a year.\xc2\xa0 The President has a record of ensuring that 2.5 million young adults can get covered under their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The President has a record that you can evaluate that has allowed 55 -- 54 million Americans to access free preventative coverage through their private insurance plans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to contrast that record with Republicans who say we should go back to the status quo; we should go back to a system that empowers insurance companies to kick you off your health care plan if you get sick; that empowers insurance companies to discriminate against you if you have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goyal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Goyal, I know that Mr. Rhodes read out the bilateral meeting that the President had with Prime Minister Gilani yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President was pleased to have the opportunity to have that meeting, was pleased with the way that the discussions went.\xc2\xa0 But for details I\xe2\x80\x99d refer to that -- for a detailed readout of that meeting I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to that conference call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of nuclear security, as you know, this has been an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s been at the front of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda since before he was even elected President.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that he worked on in the Senate; he delivered a high-profile speech on this issue in Prague in his first year in office, hosted a nuclear security summit here in Washington, D.C., and, of course, attended the summit in 2012 in Seoul, Korea where they announced a number of advances on this front. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is an issue that remains a national security priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s, and the President was pleased with the -- with some of the announcements that were made in the course of the summit earlier this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned -- since Prime Minister of India was in South Korea -- if the President had on the sideline the economic conversations as far as the U.S.-India (inaudible) are concerned.\xc2\xa0 Because today, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see hundreds of thousands of U.S. cars on every road in India, including Ford now, as I said last week, is investing over $1 billion dollars there.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of things are going on now between U.S. and India through trade and security and defense and a lot of issues.\xc2\xa0 Where do we stand on those and many other issues today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I probably will briefly, but I can tell you that the President himself addressed this issue pretty directly on Tuesday when he was in Seoul. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s reset policy with Russia has already been successful.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Russian support of the Nuclear Security Council resolutions that included the toughest sanctions ever on North Korea and Iran, our work together on the new START Treaty, and our work to open up the Northern Distribution Network to get critical supplies to troops in Afghanistan, just to name a few of the advances that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made as it relates to our relationship with Russia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to missile defense, the fact of the matter is that the President is building -- has advocated for and the United States is building a missile defense system in Europe that will ensure the safety of our allies in Europe, and, yes, ensure the safety of the United States.\xc2\xa0 From the beginning, that missile defense system has been oriented to address threats from Iran and other places.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s been oriented toward Russia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is some work to be done to reach an agreement with Russia.\xc2\xa0 I think the President talked about the need for some of the technical advisors on either side to spend some time clearing out the underbrush of detailed, technical concerns that have been raised by one side or the other.\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that in the next year or two we can start to demonstrate some tangible progress in finding common ground on this missile defense system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the angle of those that are suggesting that perhaps the President might lean his policies towards the left after the election, using that same analogy that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a freer hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- those of you who have had the opportunity to hear the President speak either at some of the political events that he\xe2\x80\x99s attended or even some of the official events where the President has talked about his vision for the future of this country, the President believes that we are at a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and that we need to put in place the kinds of economic policies that will support an economy that ensure everybody gets a fair shot, everybody gets a fair shake and everybody does their fair share. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is the -- that is the foundation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for a second term.\xc2\xa0 And that gives you a pretty good indication -- should give the American people a pretty a good indication -- about the direction that the President would go if he\xe2\x80\x99s elected to a second term by the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to the Senate resolution proposed by Senator Lieberman and five Republicans calling on the administration to arm the Syrian rebels?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, frankly, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s wise to speculate about it.\xc2\xa0 We have confirmed for you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve confirmed for you, others have confirmed for you -- repeatedly -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s an option on the table.\xc2\xa0 But there also is an attempt by some observers to suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s been made or there\xe2\x80\x99s been a specific action that\xe2\x80\x99s been proposed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just not true.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it inherent that this sort of decision takes weeks and months to even set up?\xc2\xa0 So just setting up the dominos to try to create this decision seems to be already underway.\xc2\xa0 I mean how come you can\xe2\x80\x99t even just confirm that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not, primarily because the President has a record on health care reform that is pretty persuasive.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to flip to the right page and talk to you about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have a debate with critics who would adopt a position that sends us back to the status quo that would give more power to insurance companies, allow them to kick you off your health insurance if you get sick, allow them to deny you coverage if you have a pre-existing condition -- to discriminate against you, if you will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, on the other hand, has a record that he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to run on, which actually speaks for itself -- that there are 5.1 million seniors who have obtained assistance in paying for their prescription drugs that has saved them more than $3 billion collectively, that there are 2.5 million young adults who are getting health care coverage under their parent\xe2\x80\x99s plan.\xc2\xa0 There are 54 million Americans who have obtained free preventative services through their private insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we want to have a debate about the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts and successes on the Affordable Care Act and the policy objectives that have been put forward by Republicans that would only empower insurance companies, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have that debate.\xc2\xa0 And I -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the American people decide but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll win.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s a problem that you still need to keep reading these facts and figures, that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t really --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, of all the questions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve faced today, this is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s easiest to defend.\xc2\xa0 This is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s easiest to explain.\xc2\xa0 The President has a proactive case to make, and the critics of this law, they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Unless they want to go out there and make the case to the American public that insurance companies deserve more power, that insurance companies deserve the right to kick you off your insurance if you get sick, that they deserve the right to put a lifetime cap on your benefits.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that they do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have with any of the critics of the law in the venue of their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Lesley.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan to make that case any time soon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen that the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has been pretty aggressive in making this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will he himself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to offer you.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the organizational prowess of the campaign that is being operated by my colleagues in Chicago will make the case about how the President has used his first three years in office.\xc2\xa0 An important part of what he has done during those three years is to put in place health care reform that has lowered costs, that has expanded access to coverage, that has reduced prescription drug cost for seniors, that has made it easier for young adults to get health insurance coverage, that has allowed 54 million Americans to get access to preventative services. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a record to run on.\xc2\xa0 And this is an important part of how the President has used his first three years in office, and is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to stand on the side of middle-class families and to fight against insurance companies and other special interests that are looking to take advantage of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lesley.\xc2\xa0 Last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would there be a feeling that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak on it now while it\xe2\x80\x99s up before the Court?\xc2\xa0 I mean, because there was all that brouhaha last week about how he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a -- celebrated the anniversary.\xc2\xa0 But has there been any thought about -- now that -- after the argument?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new scheduling announcements to put forward at this case.\xc2\xa0 But I am confident that you can certainly talk to the campaign to see if they have plans that they want to tell you about.\xc2\xa0 But I feel confident saying from here that both at the White House and at the campaign -- I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to make this prediction -- that they will continue to talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record during his first three years in office.\xc2\xa0 And a centerpiece of that record is the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on the issue of health care reform while the President has been in office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Enjoy the rest of your Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 3:16 P.M.
