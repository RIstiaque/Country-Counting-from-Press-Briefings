<h1>Press Briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 7/22/2010</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>\xc2\xa0See below for an answer to a question(marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0* The largest components of the legislation that the President signed on November 6, 2009, the "Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009," were the extension of the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit through April 30, 2010, a $6,500 credit to certain other homebuyers through April 30, 2010 and a provision expanding net operating losses for business taxes. \xc2\xa0The bill also added 20 weeks of unemployment insurance. The unemployment insurance provision was 10 percent of the gross cost of the bill as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office ($2.4 billion out of $23.9 billion).</p>\n<p>1:56 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0A few questions following up on Shirley Sherrod. \xc2\xa0Just a point of order, in the statement --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Point of order?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Point of order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Is there a parliamentarian for Ben\xe2\x80\x99s point of order?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I cede my time to the gentleman from the Associated Press. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The statement says --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0If there are no objections -- go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0The President expressed to Ms. Sherrod his regret. \xc2\xa0Is it accurate to say that he apologized, personally apologized?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Thank you, the point of order.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Reclaiming your time?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Reclaiming the time. \xc2\xa0Did he lobby for her to take her job back --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- or to take the new job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, look, that was not what the call was about and not what happened on the call. \xc2\xa0Obviously the President said, as the readout discusses, that she has a unique set of experiences and a unique opportunity to continue using those experiences to help people. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said to her. \xc2\xa0And obviously a decision about what she\xe2\x80\x99s going to do is up to her, and I think she is supposed to talk with the Department of Agriculture at some point today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0She did accept his apology?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Maybe I missed this, but why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just have her old job back?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I would point you to USDA in terms of -- they\xe2\x80\x99re handling the jobs discussions with Ms. Sherrod. \xc2\xa0I would say that -- I think what Secretary Vilsack offered was something that allows her to, again, as the President said, use some unique experiences to help root out what we know is long -- a department that has struggled with discrimination.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President invite Ms. Sherrod --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I would just say that she\xe2\x80\x99s a -- as April pointed out yesterday -- she\xe2\x80\x99s a plaintiff in the Pigford discrimination case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President invite her to the White House?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it clear why the President was unable to reach her yesterday? \xc2\xa0Apparently he tried and -- she\xe2\x80\x99s been all over TV -- why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she reachable?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It may have been because she was all over TV.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The White House operator tried on at least two occasions last night and was both unable to reach her and unable to leave a voicemail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last point on that. \xc2\xa0Is the White House comfortable with the fact that she has been on a lot of television shows?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s free to do and say what every other person in the country is free to do and say.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask about energy. \xc2\xa0Senator Kerry said it could be very tough to get the energy bill passed, and there\xe2\x80\x99s been talk that it could be scaled down and become more of a referendum on offshore drilling. \xc2\xa0I was wondering what response you had to that, and also any comment on what chances do you think there is of getting the bill done?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say I think that Senator Reid is -- and Carol Browner and other members of the administration are on the Hill now with Democratic senators to discuss how best to move forward on energy legislation. \xc2\xa0The President is committed to moving comprehensive energy legislation, understanding, though, that in the environment that we live -- everything takes 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, which means there have to be -- there has to be bipartisan support and bipartisan cooperation for moving forward and getting something done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I do know there\xe2\x80\x99s discussions about ensuring that increasing oil spill liability is part of legislation and dealing with some of the problems that have been presented as a result of the BP oil spill. \xc2\xa0And I think those will certainly be in whatever legislation is taken up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, speaking of BP, what are you hearing today in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with the prospect of the tropical storm, evacuations?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Admiral Allen is going to brief a little bit later on today, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on this, but tropical depression warnings have gone out for the Bahamas and parts of South Florida, as the -- and the President received a briefing, as you all got the readout, in the Situation Room yesterday both about where we are on the cap and that process, as well as the trajectory of the storm potentially leading across Florida and into the Gulf.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The protocols, Admiral Allen sent a letter to BP a day or so ago asking them for their timeline on removing equipment in the Gulf in the event that a storm heads in that area. \xc2\xa0Right now we have a trajectory that would put it -- put this storm, the intensity with which we obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know, into the Gulf. \xc2\xa0The protocols that have generally been established by Admiral Allen are if you believe that what are considered gale force winds, so winds in excess of 39 miles an hour, are likely at the site, that preparations should begin 120 hours prior to that event in terms of moving that equipment out of the area.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Obviously the equipment is owned by different companies. \xc2\xa0So Transocean and BP and others all will make individual decisions as companies about when they would move equipment. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this storm has intensified and decisions will be made probably likely later this afternoon on moving some of that equipment out of there. \xc2\xa0For instance, the DD3, which is the rig drilling the relief well that is closest to the active well right now, about five feet away from it, is -- that and the Q4000, which was the boat burning the oil recovered through the original cap -- those decisions I\xe2\x80\x99m told will be made about 8:00 tonight about whether or not to move those assets.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Later this afternoon, I think they will have a decision, and I would tune in to Admiral Allen\xe2\x80\x99s briefing for more information on this.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 About what we do with the sealing cap during a hurricane. \xc2\xa0During the briefing yesterday, Secretary Chu and members of the scientific team that have been working on the monitoring, the seismic -- reading the seismic material on the testing, have been encouraged by what they have seen; believe that, as of yesterday, that the well was stable. \xc2\xa0So he is encouraged by what he\xe2\x80\x99s seen in the testing that has been conducted using the sealing cap.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think a final decision, again, if the area is evacuated, whether to keep that sealing cap on, is a decision that will be made over the course of the next several hours.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Secretary Gates today announced that the Obama administration was lifting a more than decade-long ban on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s special forces unit. \xc2\xa0Human rights groups are outraged by this because the special forces unit has been accused of all sorts of serious crimes. \xc2\xa0Can you explain why this decision was made?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on this, Jake. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d point you over to the Pentagon on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you a question about Ms. Sherrod? \xc2\xa0Has the President seen the full 45-minute video or at least parts --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0He mentioned during the call that he had read the transcript of her interview.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The full transcript?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The full transcript of -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, not of her interview, but of her speech.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what did he think? \xc2\xa0What was his personal reaction to her story?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly what he said on the call, but I think they talked about how -- look, we all have -- I think he talked about and -- talked about experiences that he had had and written about in his book that in some ways were similar to the experiences that she has written and talked about as part of that speech.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you elaborate a little?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s literally all that was said about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Overcoming his own biases and his own --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- he just talked about what he\xe2\x80\x99d written in his book. \xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get deeply into that part.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you just elaborate a little bit on his personal reaction to either reading the transcript of her fuller speech or to the call itself, to actually talking to this woman?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, he thought she was -- look, obviously she\xe2\x80\x99s got a remarkable story. \xc2\xa0He expressed his apologies for the events of the last several days. \xc2\xa0Obviously, again, this is a woman who has a unique set of experiences, both before this incident and now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Which book are you referring to -- the memoir or --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The memoir. \xc2\xa0So I think that -- again, he was -- he thought she was very gracious. \xc2\xa0And I would say, as we did in the readout, the President expressed to Ms. Sherrod that Secretary Vilsack had, he believed, been extremely sincere in his comments yesterday, in his apologies, and believed that he was also equally sincere about the work that he is leading at the Department of Agriculture to ensure that the department\xe2\x80\x99s activities are conducted without discrimination.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, Robert, yesterday during the briefing someone asked whether the administration would be putting forward Cheryl Cook so she could sort of talk about what was said with Ms. Sherrod, and you directed that question to the USDA. \xc2\xa0Now that the President has apologized to Ms. Sherrod, why not put Cheryl Cook forward to say what she did --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d point you over to USDA on that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you talked to USDA.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but she\xe2\x80\x99s the person who supposedly said that the White House wanted her to step down --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Dan, if you want to reach the under secretary or the deputy secretary, again, call the Department of Agriculture. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know where she is, she is Cheryl Cook?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I assume at the Department of Agriculture. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where she is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But no plans at this point that you know of to put her forward so she can clear this up what was said?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Dan, again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in talking to the deputy secretary, call the press office at the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, wait, I have another question, Robert.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- the USDA not allowing people to talk to her?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, this was supposed to be a week of focusing on Wall Street reform, the economy, kind an economy week, and there\xe2\x80\x99s this story that\xe2\x80\x99s been dominating the headlines. \xc2\xa0Any frustration at all politically that the message was lost behind this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday you said maybe the President would speak on this at some point. \xc2\xa0Any progress on that? \xc2\xa0Do you think he will?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is he avoiding speaking on this? \xc2\xa0Somebody shouted a question earlier in the signing today of unemployment. \xc2\xa0Is that going to happen in a place with reporters in the room?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the bill will be signed. \xc2\xa0I know the President is anxious to sign it. \xc2\xa0We have unemployment benefits that you know if you\xe2\x80\x99re -- if you\xe2\x80\x99ve exhausted your state unemployment benefits at 26 weeks, despite the fact that normally through the Recovery Act we extended benefits though the 99th week, people -- 2.5 million people have lost their benefits.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will it be done to still photographers only to avoid questions on this matter?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the coverage is. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re anxious to get the bill and sign it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was one year ago today that the President said the Cambridge Police acted \xe2\x80\x9cstupidly\xe2\x80\x9d in the Henry Louis Gates matter, which kind of obliterated other news for about a week. \xc2\xa0Is that why the President is not coming out and talking about this publicly?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Because of the year anniversary of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he want to avoid that kind of media firestorm so that he can keep his focus on other issues?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could I ask you one other question, a substantive question on unemployment insurance?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You said that. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President -- as opposed to the procedural questions that I ask. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0As a point of order -- can you just circle that out of the transcript?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President this morning made the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of waste, fraud and abuse in the budget, and that there\xe2\x80\x99s been an aggressive effort to go after that. \xc2\xa0Did the White House try -- at least try to find $34 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse so that they could pay for this unemployment insurance bill as the Republicans are insisting they do?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0As a -- no, this was -- Chip, we had -- I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you were here last week when we I think discussed this twice. \xc2\xa0Unemployment benefits and extending unemployment insurance has and I believe rightfully should be considered emergency spending. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of an economic downturn unlike anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in here a thousand times, anything since the late 1920s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 That demands special action. \xc2\xa0The long-term unemployed are a big part of that 8.5 million jobs that have been lost. \xc2\xa0This -- it took the Senate four different times just to get to this point. \xc2\xa0And thankfully we had Republicans like Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe that were -- have understood that as they have voted in the past to extend unemployment benefits as emergency spending, unlike some who decided this was a perfect opportunity to play politics; much as there\xe2\x80\x99s a bill on the floor now to cut taxes on small business, which the President greatly supports.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a component of that legislation to extend lending through community banks to small businesses to help create jobs, yet for as many times as most Republicans talk about small business, there\xe2\x80\x99s an effort to block that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think the newspapers had it quite correctly this morning, that\xe2\x80\x99s because of politics\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you can get that benefit from unemployment benefits, from passing it. \xc2\xa0And at the same time, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President say, okay, guys, this has been going on -- you had months with all these different votes. \xc2\xa0Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he call up Orszag and the green eye shade guys and say, go in there, find me $34 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse; let\xe2\x80\x99s pay for this thing at the same time that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the benefits of this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, because, Chip, this is -- the President believes this should be treated, like every President has previously, as emergency spending. \xc2\xa0And thankfully, the partisan games are over because of the good help of two Republicans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Really? \xc2\xa0Is that going to continue through Election Day on both sides?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to continue through today. \xc2\xa0Again, I just mentioned that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is going to be a political football through Election Day?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Which one?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Unemployment insurance?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to have that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to make each and every day about whether you\xe2\x80\x99re for people that have lost their jobs having the benefits that they pay for in order to make ends meet when they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost their job. \xc2\xa0Governing is about choices, Chip, each and every day.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But we talk about the partisan political games. \xc2\xa0I just said there\xe2\x80\x99s $30 billion to community banks to lend to small businesses to create jobs. \xc2\xa0I cannot imagine that in a normal time or in a normal year, that would be considered controversial. \xc2\xa0But welcome to July 2010.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve now spent a couple of instances with the President talking about this issue with Sherrod. \xc2\xa0Can you share with us more of his sort of impressions of this week, of what -- sort of this firestorm, the circus atmosphere?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Chuck, we have -- the circus. \xc2\xa0We have not honestly spent a lot of time talking about that. \xc2\xa0We were -- I obviously heard part of the call in order to provide a readout for you guys. \xc2\xa0But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a long chance to talk about it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve done some media criticism. \xc2\xa0You were quoted in The Washington Post today --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0And in here yesterday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And in here yesterday. \xc2\xa0Have you shared that with him? \xc2\xa0Is this his thinking as well?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- as I said yesterday, the actions of this administration should be reflected on. \xc2\xa0I think the actions of the media and our media culture should be reflected on. \xc2\xa0The statements and the actions of interest groups on each side of this should be reflected on. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually gotten a number of emails from reporters that share those reflections.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why did the President -- is there a reason -- you emphasized here and in the readout it was emphasized that he wanted to make sure she knew that Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s apology was sincere. \xc2\xa0Has there been a concern that she thought it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. \xc2\xa0I think -- look, I think most of you all saw what Secretary Vilsack said. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x9d probably could or should be said a lot more in this town, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get out sometimes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I thought what Secretary -- I think it was hard to watch what Secretary Vilsack did and not believe this was coming from the bottom of his heart. \xc2\xa0And I think the President simply wanted to convey that if there was any doubt in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and if there was any doubt in her mind, of the sincerity of and the work that Secretary Vilsack has both undertaken and pledged to do, that that -- that both of those were from the bottom of his heart, and they were genuinely sincere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another topic. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a letter-writing campaign being done by some poverty activists in southeast Ohio, on Appalachia. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been writing letters to the President on paper plates. \xc2\xa0Do you know if the President -- I know that the President -- I know you guys go through these letters. \xc2\xa0Do you know of any of these letters --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me check --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- that have come to him?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0I know he gets regularly those -- five to 10 of those letters. \xc2\xa0Let me see if any of those have gone to him.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a view about whether it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for a mosque to be built near the Ground Zero site in New York?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think I got this question last week, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t render an opinion on it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, no, you still don\xe2\x80\x99t have an opinion on it? \xc2\xa0And just one quick thing on the Sherrod situation, from what the -- from the conversation that you heard, she had said that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to just get an apology from the President, she wanted to have a conversation about the issues that all of this sparked. \xc2\xa0Do you think the conversation they had was sort of a conversation about the issue, the exchange of ideas? \xc2\xa0Or was it a little more perfunctory? \xc2\xa0How would you describe it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think they had an opportunity to talk about parts of the situation, and, again, the President expressed his regret and expressed that her unique experiences provided her a good opportunity to continue that work, and they talked about, as I said a minute ago, some of the experiences that I think each of them have had.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Ms. Sherrod talked about some of the work that she had done as the head of rural development in Georgia. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s when the President said, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for you to continue that work if you want to do so.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I think it was a -- I know the President believed it was a good call.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Mark.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, in November of last year, President Obama signed an extension of unemployment benefits. \xc2\xa0And in his statement he made a point of saying that they were fully paid for and an example of fiscal responsibility. \xc2\xa0When did he change his mind about unemployment benefits not being --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- let me look at the thing and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- *</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I give the text of what he said?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give it to Bill and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to take a look at it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the pressure to nominate Elizabeth Warren to head the consumer agency -- pressure you guys are getting from congressional Democrats and consumer groups -- how is that helping or hurting the process? \xc2\xa0And do you have any timeline for when --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, as I said yesterday, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect an imminent announcement. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are several positions that this legislation created. \xc2\xa0Obviously one of those important jobs are the office -- the consumer bureau. \xc2\xa0I think, as I said yesterday, that she is somebody who -- look, in many ways, this bureau was borne out of a policy idea that she had. \xc2\xa0I think she would be somebody who would be obviously terrific at that job, well qualified.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How many candidates --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about several candidates, people like Michael Barr, who has done terrific work over at the Treasury now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you want to get this through before the August recess?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Get?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you want to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I do not think there\xe2\x80\x99s a scenario in which the Senate will act on this before the August recess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the House just passed the unemployment benefits bill. \xc2\xa0Will the President sign it --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0As soon as we get it, we will -- the President will sign that legislation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Likely today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0I assume so.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I had a question about Ken Feinberg. \xc2\xa0Since he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the power to recover the money from companies that he says --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- this is -- not at BP, but you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now as the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0So since he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the power to recover that money, will the White House exert pressure for these executives to give the money back?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99d wait -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to look at that question tomorrow when we have a -- I think the report he releases comes out tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Major.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You may have addressed this with Laura, but this morning Shirley Sherrod said she wanted to talk to the President about her experiences growing up in the South, the rural parts of America, communicate to him things that she was under the impression he may not have had a sufficient awareness of or personal experience with. \xc2\xa0Did that go on with the conversation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Major, I think each and every person brings unique and special experiences from their life. \xc2\xa0I think we learn most probably from experience. \xc2\xa0But, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a fair readout of what happened in the call. \xc2\xa0There was not a long conversation about her life in the South.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was a protest yesterday about the deepwater drilling moratorium. \xc2\xa0There are some reports that international drilling companies may move some equipment out, taking advantage of this moratorium.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Taking advantage of the moratorium?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, in that because it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done here, moving equipment elsewhere to where it can be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Okay, maybe I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the words \xe2\x80\x9ctaking advantage of.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Perhaps I could have phrased it differently. \xc2\xa0Is that -- the concerns expressed by those in the Gulf continue to mount, they\xe2\x80\x99re not abating, there is some indication that drilling platforms that were there may be moved out, and there could be a continued loss of jobs. \xc2\xa0I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve weighed this carefully, but does this persistent concern economically there raise any additional reasons to reevaluate the moratorium?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President believes and the administration believe that the moratorium we have in place is there for a very important reason, and that is to ensure that we have a better sense of what is happening and what happened, and to create a regulatory framework that addresses the fact that drilling is happening in places that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have as much experience at.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Five thousand -- I mean, the unique challenges that this accident -- the unique challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve run into are because you can\xe2\x80\x99t walk up to a blowout preventer and fix it. \xc2\xa0You can in shallow-water drilling because, in many ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- those are blowout preventers that are on top of the surface.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that it is important to understand what happened before we start doing this again. \xc2\xa0He understands the concerns expressed economically. \xc2\xa0At the same time, those same people express the concerns of what is happening now. \xc2\xa0And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here before, there are -- you hear from, say, the governor of Louisiana discuss the deepwater drilling moratorium right after he talks about how hard is to work with BP. \xc2\xa0And you have to understand that four of those permits are held by BP. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it sometimes gets hard to match up how exactly you can have both of those emotions going at one time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President understands that, but at the same time, his job is to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that we can safely, that we have -- and you saw plans yesterday by oil companies on how to respond, which I think were clearly lacking before those were released.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of BP, are you aware of this burgeoning controversy about the Photoshopping of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0About the BP --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Photoshopping --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, oh, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Photoshopping -- do you have a comment on that? \xc2\xa0Has the administration expressed any concern directly through Admiral Allen or anyone else about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Where does this fall on the transparency scale as far as you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s genuinely on the stupidity part of the transparency scale. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0If you want to show a picture of what the room looks like, just take a picture. \xc2\xa0I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, I think you could probably write an entire encyclopedia on some of the mistakes that have been made by the company in trying to do certain things and trying to complicate the simple. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We asked for several days for cameras to be put on at the site, to make that available -- make that footage available. \xc2\xa0Again, I think the resistance on that, Photoshopping people and screens into photographs, is stupidly complicating the simple.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One question quickly on the supplemental, which has to be done by next week before the House is scheduled to go.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0To go, right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s -- as I understand it -- the White House\xe2\x80\x99s preference -- communicated preference that be a clean supplemental, the House still somewhat attached to the spending it had previously put on the supplemental. \xc2\xa0What is the status of that? \xc2\xa0What are the -- where are the negotiations --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me check with Legislative Affairs --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And am I understanding the White House position on that correctly?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me get -- because it moves around a bit with the Senate and the House, let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s an update on that. \xc2\xa0I know there was some -- I heard some discussion today that the supplemental might be taken up as -- depending on when the -- when small business was acted on, it could come -- yes, it could come late today or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, when the President gave his speech on race during the campaign, he lamented a tendency in our society to tackle race only as spectacle. \xc2\xa0The events of this week would suggest that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t exactly moved beyond that. \xc2\xa0Does the President believe --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Is this my question to you or your question to me? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s -- well, but does the President -- and in that speech had vowed to take a leadership role in moving society beyond that -- does he believe that any progress has been made on his watch? \xc2\xa0And has he done any reconsideration of what his own role might be, what he should be doing to further that along?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think -- look, I think we have tried to and made progress on issues that are -- look, I think look at an issue like education. \xc2\xa0We have tried -- I think you would hear of many civil rights leaders talk about education as a civil rights issue.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on -- through initiatives like Race to the Top, which have seen an increase in standards, is something that represents -- well, not maybe the traditional topic that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, but a better sense of equality in this country, at least in terms of the education that\xe2\x80\x99s offered to our children.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President was under any illusion that -- and I think has said as such -- that his election alone would change long held views. \xc2\xa0And I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having discussions on race and have -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will continue to be differing opinions long after this President has left.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, does he believe -- there have been kind of formalized sporadic efforts in the past to sort of officially start a conversation on race. \xc2\xa0Certainly, you could say that, I mean, during the Clinton administration -- you could argue that that was what the \xe2\x80\x9cBeer Summit\xe2\x80\x9d was all about. \xc2\xa0What does the President --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I would actually argue that the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily -- first of all, the \xe2\x80\x9cBeer Summit\xe2\x80\x9d is a great example. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken -- a term you guys coined.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ever --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re right, but --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you embraced it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You embraced it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You drank it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, well -- I drank the beer. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, what is the use -- what is the usefulness of these sort of events, these kind of choreographed events that do this versus the kind of thing you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say this, let me say this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and Dan had a point. \xc2\xa0Look, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s dominated the news. \xc2\xa0And I was asked -- Chip asked yesterday if this is a teachable moment, is the President the teacher. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have to have a teacher for this to be a teachable moment. \xc2\xa0I doubt that any of us have gone through the events of the past several days, if you work in this administration, and thinking back to how this was -- how this came to be, it\xe2\x80\x99s conjecture, but my guess is a lot of you all have thought about these issues in a way you might not have thought about last week because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the forefront.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s these types of experiences that allow us to think through some of these issues and think about them in different ways. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you necessarily have to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a teachable moment in the sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s a classroom setting, but each person has and sees experiences either that they take part in, or that they hear about as part of the news that provide you a chance to look and learn. \xc2\xa0And maybe what we do is we learn that -- certainly if you listen to the entirety of what Ms. Sherrod was saying you learn about the -- how her experiences changed the way she thinks and the way she acts. \xc2\xa0And maybe because of that we take the time to think about how we think and how we act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think in that way, you -- while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a set event or a symposium or a big meeting, it\xe2\x80\x99s still, in and of itself, a moment that I think provides us an opportunity to reflect and change.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, can I just follow up? \xc2\xa0If this is a teachable moment, what is the lesson? \xc2\xa0Is it about race? \xc2\xa0Or is it about media and politics?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99d oversimplify it just as something -- I mean, I think it -- I mean, the beauty of a big teachable moment is each person gets to take away from it something different, right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I mean, look, have I thought about the way all this unfolded? \xc2\xa0Of course. \xc2\xa0That the next time I hear about an event like this and a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made somewhat -- that you stop and ask, did we look at the whole context? \xc2\xa0Did we look at everything?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that those same discussions aren\xe2\x80\x99t being had in your newsrooms by both you, your editors, by producers, in saying, next time maybe -- maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s race, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s media and culture. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think all of it is one -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all in one big -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all one big thing. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- but, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the great thing is we all get to learn and look back and evaluate the entirety of the situation and pull different things.</p>\n<p>I think you can probably pull both, right? \xc2\xa0I think you can probably pull the lesson that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would doubt and this -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not up here to lecture or scold because I\xe2\x80\x99m -- nobody that has been involved in this whole situation, from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, is, as I said, isn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking about what has happened. \xc2\xa0But asking that question, did we see the whole thing; do we know when that story was; do we know what her background is; do we know how the story ends -- I think -- certainly I think stuff like that is helpful and reflective because I think not only is it, do we live in this crazy reality-TV culture, right? \xc2\xa0Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of it, but I also think it was undoubtedly sparked by the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion about race and that is something that always garners a lot of attention.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0May I just follow up, Robert?</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, can I have just one quick question -- you might have answered this before -- did the President watch the whole video?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I said earlier that I think -- he said on the phone call to her that he had read a transcript of --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Of the whole thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And when you were listening in or in the room, were you only listening to his part? \xc2\xa0Or did you hear also -- hear her too?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I could hear both parts.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You could hear both parts.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t even work for CNN. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Sorry, I had to say that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And it sounds like what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying in terms of the teachable moment, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who is doing the teaching, it\xe2\x80\x99s her in the entirety of her remarks. \xc2\xa0Is that--</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one lesson you\xe2\x80\x99d learn, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Putting aside that people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leap before they look -- get all the facts, but just in terms of the -- teaching about race, that was her --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think -- look, I think if I were writing the chapter title, it might be what you just said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook Before you Leap.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It might be \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Rush to Judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d because that\xe2\x80\x99s all about the fact that conclusions were drawn by all involved based on what we thought was the entirety of and what we now know is a very small part of it.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But when he read the whole transcript, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if he felt it was -- I mean, it really was almost like a sermon. \xc2\xa0It was almost Obama-esque. \xc2\xa0I mean, she had a parable. \xc2\xa0She talked about how she was tempted to do one thing and learned to do another.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, what was his reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0He did not provide me that reaction, but, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing this in his voice, but I think very much -- I would not disagree with the fact that -- which I think is what makes the story so -- ultimately such a powerful one is that -- and why, quite frankly, you could understand that if you just read part of it or just see part of it, you\xe2\x80\x99d come to a different, albeit completely wrong, conclusion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit against Arizona is getting underway in court today. \xc2\xa0Obviously the federal argument is based on preemption, but civil rights groups who are suing say the law will lead to racial discrimination. \xc2\xa0Does the President still agree with that? \xc2\xa0Does he still think the law will lead to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Department of Justice that can provide you more on the case that it will argue today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We cannot -- despite the frustration of folks in Arizona, which is real and which is understandable, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have 50 states creating 50 different -- the potential to create 50 different immigration laws. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that the government will argue in court today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Peter.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Is the matter closed, as far as Secretary Vilsack is concerned, or is anyone from the White House likely to speak to him about judgments that he\xe2\x80\x99s making in firing a person based on reading into a two-minute video?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I would point you to what he said yesterday. \xc2\xa0I think he was pretty clear on how this would change the way he would do things in the future. \xc2\xa0I thought he was -- I thought that was heartfelt and gracious. \xc2\xa0I think his words largely speak for themselves on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up. \xc2\xa0You said earlier the President told Shirley Sherrod that Secretary Vilsack was extremely sincere. \xc2\xa0Did the President talk to Tom Vilsack?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President spoke with Secretary Vilsack last night.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the discussion -- did they talk at all about Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s tenure? \xc2\xa0Did he offer to resign?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I know they spoke. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- sorry? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they talked about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he offer to resign?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m -- no, not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a completely different subject. \xc2\xa0Senators Nelson --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0And I would say this -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any cause for him to do so. \xc2\xa0I think that Secretary Vilsack is in charge of a department with a history of discrimination. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why there was a settlement months ago in a longstanding case on discrimination against black farmers. \xc2\xa0There have been discrimination against female farmers, Native American farmers. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is a department that has struggled with many of the demons that have been struggled with in other parts of our society.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And the Secretary believes and has stated that there is a -- there is and there should be a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination. \xc2\xa0And I think the President thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s doing good work.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But for the sake of argument, the Secretary engaged in discrimination this week when he fired this woman.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0And, again, as I said earlier, uttered words not often heard inside the glorious District of Columbia, and that is \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I made a mistake, I acted before I had the full benefit of what had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think Secretary Vilsack has been clear about the mistakes that he made in -- over the past few days.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a different subject, Senators Conrad and Nelson have called for the President to extend the Bush tax cuts on those making more than $200,000. \xc2\xa0Any reaction to that? \xc2\xa0Any rethinking of that proposal --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0Again, I would point you largely to what I said yesterday. \xc2\xa0I think Secretary Geithner has weighed on this today. \xc2\xa0And I look forward to Chip asking many of those members how that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be paid for.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, back on -- a few questions on race and Ms. Sherrod. \xc2\xa0Do you think that this whole situation, bringing out everything, the discrimination that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the Department of Agriculture and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with Ms. Sherrod, do you think that that would push forward the issues of Cobell and Pigford for there to be funding in Congress to happen soon?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I can\xe2\x80\x99t divine what happens in the House and the Senate. \xc2\xa0I will say this. \xc2\xa0I think one of the reasons I just gave Steve the answer I did is I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you need this event to tell you that what happened at the department was wrong. \xc2\xa0The Secretary didn\xe2\x80\x99t settle this case as a result of what had happened here, but as a result of what had happened. \xc2\xa0He made those decisions long ago.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Fifteen years ago, Pigford was awarded. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 15 years and now four deadlines for Congress -- this Congress --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, my guess is a lot more than four deadlines have been missed over the course of 15 years, April. \xc2\xa0And I daresay that discrimination goes back a lot farther than that period of time. \xc2\xa0Obviously the House and the Senate are working through a number of issues on this, and the President remains committed to ensuring that that settlement is done.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You say \xe2\x80\x9ca teachable moment\xe2\x80\x9d -- this is a teachable moment, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need a teacher, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a heart issue. \xc2\xa0President Clinton, when he had the conversation on race, talked about the fact that this was a heart issue, and sometimes trying to navigate through heart issues, you may need someone. \xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s taken all this time and we\xe2\x80\x99re still at a point where we\xe2\x80\x99re still dealing with racism and discrimination.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be dealing -- look, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen for a long time, April. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President of the United States, regardless of his race, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think would come out here and tell you that as a result of him or his election or his time here that racism and discrimination will end. \xc2\xa0While I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine anybody would want to see it continue, this is something that this country has struggled with for a very, very long time and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last question --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But I will say this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody can doubt, April, that each day and maybe as a result of this we make a little progress. \xc2\xa0And I think that in and of itself is probably the most important point.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last question. \xc2\xa0In this town, many people have said it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to turn down a President when he asks you to take a position. \xc2\xa0Now, would this White House --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just be clear. \xc2\xa0I think I was asked this earlier, this was -- that was not the point of this call, and the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lobbying her to take a position. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation that she -- I was asked yesterday, well, why is this happening with the Secretary of Agriculture? \xc2\xa0Well, she worked for the Secretary of Agriculture. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s her most --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the President extended that job offer to her as well, and again --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear. \xc2\xa0The President -- I hate to be nitpicky, but -- well, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the readout. \xc2\xa0The readout says that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in front of me, but that based on the experiences that you have and that -- this is an opportunity to continue to -- if you want to, to continue to work for progress on the issues that you know that are important to you. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s her decision. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that she will discuss again with the department and will discuss, I assume, if need be, with Secretary Vilsack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the hope is for her to take that job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t describe that as lobbying?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- this was not a \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Shirley, take this job.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0This is -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the role that the call was designed for or that the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he want her to take the job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, is the hope for her to take that job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s office emailed her a specific job offer this morning; they have not heard back yet. \xc2\xa0President Obama is talking about her continuing her good work --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, this is a decision that Shirley should make and that Shirley is most comfortable with. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the hope for her to take the job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think I just answered that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, Andrew Breitbart has been pretty unrepentant in this instance. \xc2\xa0Today, he spoke with CBS and he said the administration threw her under the bus. \xc2\xa0Last night on CNN, Ms. Sherrod suggested that she might consider a libel suit. \xc2\xa0Do you think that there ought to be consequences for Andrew Breitbart for what he did in this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I bet there -- both in this town and in many towns across the country, there are very good lawyers.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that sort of an endorsement of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, no. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Look, I said earlier that something that is not uttered in this town and probably not uttered enough is, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry and I made a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Now, everybody has to look in the mirror and live with their own conscience about what was done and what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to rectify that. \xc2\xa0This is an individual who has I think on several different occasions come up with different ideas about what the video was or wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let news organizations discuss their airing of it and the way they reacted to it. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for him or for them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think the administration has taken responsibility for its actions. \xc2\xa0And do I think this episode would be a more teachable moment if he apologized to her? \xc2\xa0Absolutely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Sam -- or do you have one more?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, one more. \xc2\xa0You mentioned before that the President talked about his book with Ms. Sherrod. \xc2\xa0Which part?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- Glenn, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that detailed. \xc2\xa0He simply said that -- I think they both had -- she had talked about and he had written about experiences that in some ways were similar. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Earlier this month, the President and Senate Democrats agreed to pursue three bills, three pieces of legislation on the economy. \xc2\xa0It looks like two are going to be in the books. \xc2\xa0The third one is this small business tax cuts. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it a couple times, but it\xe2\x80\x99s largely flown below the radar. \xc2\xa0Should we expect the President to be more visible --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- and more active than --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, look, I will say that the President has done a number of events on small business. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s done a number of events on the increase in credit. \xc2\xa0We discussed yesterday the comments that the Fed Chairman had made, and one of the Fed Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s comments from last week was that we need to get more credit to small business.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We hear a lot of talk on Capitol Hill, rightly so, about helping small business. \xc2\xa0The Senate will have an opportunity, as I understand it, in a standalone amendment to vote for providing necessary and needed capital to community banks to lend to small businesses in communities all over this country to create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And I said to Chip earlier that governing is about making choices. \xc2\xa0It was about choices this week when you had to decide whether you\xe2\x80\x99re for or you\xe2\x80\x99re against extending unemployment benefits for those that have lost their jobs as a result of the greatest economic downturn in our life -- in many of our lifetimes. \xc2\xa0People had to make a choice about whether they were for the rules that governed Wall Street in September of 2008, or whether we think there ought to be a new set of rules going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And it is likely either later this week or next week, people are going to get to decide whether we should have -- give more capital to small businesses to lend -- or to banks to lend to small businesses to create jobs, or not. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re very simple choices. \xc2\xa0They will illuminate many of the choices I think that voters will get an opportunity to make in November.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should we expect to see, I mean, the same kind of visibility and aggressiveness we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on -- probably not on financial reform, but at least on the unemployment?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President was pretty aggressive on financial reform, I think the President laid out clearly what was at stake in unemployment benefits, and I expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do so as we get closer to the vote on small businesses.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 END \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 2:47 P.M.
