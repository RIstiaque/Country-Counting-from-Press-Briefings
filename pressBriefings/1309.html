EDT</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Before we start, I just want to encourage you guys, once you get Internet access when we\xe2\x80\x99re on the ground, to take a look at a new video on our website -- it was on WebMD this morning.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the President showing folks how to use healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 So you can find that at whitehouse.gov.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take some questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, what can you tell us about the BP investigation?\xc2\xa0 Has the focus widened on it?\xc2\xa0 And has the President been briefed?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I am not going to comment on an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the administration is doing everything it can to look into the cause of the tragedy that took those lives and created one of the biggest natural environmental catastrophes in the history of our country.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to hearing the results of that investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about the nature of the investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, just on the 100th day of the spill, how does the President assess the situation where we are now, and does he have anything to say to the people in the Gulf at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reports out today, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been able to make a lot of progress on cleaning up some of the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s spilled out into the Gulf and stopping the oil from coming out of the well.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to rest until we ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve cleaned up all the oil, restored the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s happened to the Gulf, and make sure that the people of that region are whole again.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work to find any oil that might not be visible from the surface, any effects that might have happened at the sea bottom or anywhere in the area, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep that work up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two closed fundraisers tonight -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get in to see him?\xc2\xa0 Is he not making remarks?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right, no remarks.\xc2\xa0 So one is at a private home; the other one is an event where he won\xe2\x80\x99t be making any formal remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meeting with Senator Kerry today -- did they talk about Lockerbie?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that specifically came up.\xc2\xa0 But it was -- they spoke about a wide variety of issues.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if Lockerbie in particular came up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House ask Senator Kerry to delay the Lockerbie hearings?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Lockerbie came up.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean before that, though.\xc2\xa0 Senate Foreign Relations Committee has delayed the hearings.\xc2\xa0 Did the White House reach out and ask them to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Oh.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss the WikiLeaks documents?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the issues that they discussed.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t be more helpful for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did they discuss?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was on the agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is one of those meetings where the President likes to touch base with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he came in to have a conversation about a wide variety of issues, both foreign and domestic, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you name some?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any in particular that they discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the President sign this war supplemental?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 If I get more clear guidance on -- when we get it, I will let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got these two events today that are kind of night and day.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the sub shop, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ve already got so many \xe2\x80\x9cDevil Wears Prada\xe2\x80\x9d jokes about the fundraiser at Anna Wintour\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xc2\xa0 Is that how you say it?\xc2\xa0 Wintar?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Wintour, I think.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you reconcile the objects of going to these lavish fundraisers when the economy is what it is?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President is doing everything he can to get this economy moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 If you take a look at where we started and where we are now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been able to make a lot of progress.\xc2\xa0 The President isn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since you asked about the event today, I do want to point out something that I read in The New York Times today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a study by two economists, Blinder and Zandi, in which they take a comprehensive look at the American Recovery Act and some of the different things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to take on -- to get the economy moving.</p>\n<p>In their report, they find that -- these are two separate quotes from the report.\xc2\xa0 First, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the effectiveness of any individual element certainly can be debated, there is little doubt that in total, the policy response was highly effective.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen all is said and done, the financial and fiscal policies will have cost taxpayers a substantial sum, but not nearly as much as most had feared and not nearly as much as if policy makers had not acted at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>And they say specifically that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product would be about 6.5 percent lower this year, and there would be about 8.5 million fewer jobs.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get around to the end of your question, but I do want to point out the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to New Jersey is to talk about some of the things that the President has done on the economy and some of the things that he thinks we need to continue on to create an environment where small businesses can create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 That means increasing lending and making it easier for -- and cutting their taxes.</p>\n<p>So obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve focused on the economy today.\xc2\xa0 This evening, the President is doing what the President traditionally does, which is helping to raise money for the campaign season as things approach.\xc2\xa0 I think that, in the same sense, the President has a wide variety of things that he has on his schedule every single day.\xc2\xa0 Today is one of those days and he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a couple different hats.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last thing I had was, does he have any canned jokes for \xe2\x80\x9cThe View\xe2\x80\x9d we should know about?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Maybe.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s embargoed till tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t give us something we can use today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be weird if I was previewing the jokes?\xc2\xa0 Then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Elizabeth Hasselbeck not laughing because she already knows the punch line.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect her and the President to get along anyway?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at their last -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s last appearance in March of 2008, I think they had a pretty good discussion.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that they will again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 March 2008?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 March 2008, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Arizona law goes into effect tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming the administration is watching that, for anything with the judge coming out.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on Arizona?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean, not in particular.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that changes how ICE functions or how the Department of Homeland Security sees its role there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:08 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
