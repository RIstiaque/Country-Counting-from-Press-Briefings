Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:57 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 Good crowd.\xc2\xa0 How is everybody?\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all had a great weekend and that some of you still have a decent bracket underway after all those upsets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I take your questions, I wanted to start with a statement by the President:\xc2\xa0 "Last week, the Senate passed a bipartisan transportation bill that will keep construction workers on the job and keep our economy growing.\xc2\xa0 Now the House of Representatives needs to take bipartisan action so I can sign this into law. An economy built to last depends on a world-class infrastructure system that allows us to transport our people and goods as quickly and effectively as possible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we need to continue to make investments that will create jobs by rebuilding and modernizing our roads, bridges and railways.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why my administration will continue to fight for the long-term investments needed to ensure that America continues to compete and succeed in a global economy."</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that to announce support for the bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is calling on -- we commended the Senate last --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Commending -- are you supporting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are calling on the House to follow the Senate\'s lead and pass bipartisan transportation legislation.\xc2\xa0 The items and minutiae in the bill we\'ll let Congress figure out. We commended the Senate for acting in a bipartisan way on this important --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you still haven\'t said whether you support that bill or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we commended the Senate for passing the bill.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not telling the House -- I\'m not going to write the legislation for them.\xc2\xa0 What we are saying is the House, like the Senate, should act in a bipartisan way and pass a bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- suggest that if it gets passed it will get signed with a statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President looks forward to signing into law a bipartisan transportation bill because of the absolute necessity that we continue to build and maintain world-class infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is fair that we\'re drawing a distinction here.\xc2\xa0 You are not -- the administration is not necessarily putting out a statement of support of this bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, whatever distinctions --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you have done that before.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I hear you.\xc2\xa0 Look, you can draw whatever distinctions you want.\xc2\xa0 We strongly urge the House to pass bipartisan transportation legislation, as the Senate has.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to signing into law a bill that is bipartisan in nature.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not necessarily supporting the Senate bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We commended them for passing it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get caught in the semantics here.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make clear that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you\'re introducing the semantics.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We want to see action by Congress on a piece of bipartisan legislation on this important topic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You kind of like it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple topics.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, the nation has learned a lot over the past couple days about Sergeant Bales, the suspect in the mass shooting in Afghanistan, and it\'s raised questions about his personal history and about the strains of war, multiple tours of duty.\xc2\xa0 Is the President closely following the case -- not just the judicial side of it but the personal story of Sergeant Bales?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I haven\'t spoken to the President about the coverage of that nature that you mention.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously very aware of the incident.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for details about the investigation and the individual that you reference, you need to put those questions to the Defense Department because there is an active investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him reflecting on Sergeant Bale\xe2\x80\x99s story and the strains of war, any of the personal side of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say that the President is focused on two things:\xc2\xa0 One, as he made clear last week, the incident, the killing of these innocent Afghan civilians was a tragic and terrible event, and it did not represent what our military stands for, what the American people stand for.\xc2\xa0 He made that clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is an investigation that\'s taking place, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to wade into that from here.\xc2\xa0 And then, there is the overall mission that our men and women in uniform are implementing in Afghanistan, which he is, of course, very focused on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- the conversations the President may or may not have had about this specific case I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep private.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying on that broader topic, when the President apologized to President Karzai about the burning of the Korean, he later explained that he did so in large part in the interest of the United States and its troops and in keeping them safe.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked this and I missed it, but can you explain why that incident would necessitate an apology but a massacre of Afghan civilians, which presumably could put troops in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, fear of reprisals, why that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we made very clear both the President\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and our feelings, from the military and as a nation, about the terrible incident that occurred in Afghanistan. There is an investigation, an active investigation ongoing, and I would refer questions about that and ask you to appreciate how we would respond to questions about it from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is that the vast majority of -- everything that we do there in Afghanistan is focused on our goal of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda; of stabilizing Afghanistan sufficiently so that we can train up and transfer authority to Afghan security forces and withdraw our troops as we do that.\xc2\xa0 The bravery and courage of our men and women in uniform has been astounding throughout, and they continue to focus on that mission in very difficult circumstances.\xc2\xa0 So the President is focused on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick domestic question.\xc2\xa0 Friday, I believe, is the anniversary of the health care law, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if we should expect to hear from the President on that milestone, which, of course, comes right before the Supreme Court arguments. Or would he just as soon not make a public statement about the health care law and let outside groups -- the campaign and others -- do the politicking around this moment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on doing everything he can, with Congress and independently, to help our economy grow and create jobs, to build an economy that\xe2\x80\x99s built to last, and to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can in Washington to bring that about. The President does speak about health care on occasion and will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on a forward agenda right now, and working with Congress and doing the things he can through executive action to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration is very focused on implementing the Affordable Care Act, which, as you know, has resulted already in benefits for millions of Americans, millions of seniors who have benefited and saved tremendous amounts of money because of the prescription drug provision related to the so-called doughnut hole, and the millions of young Americans who have insurance who otherwise would not because of the provision within the Affordable Care Act that allows young folks to stay on their parent\xe2\x80\x99s policy.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on implementing the law and on pursuing an aggressive, forward-leaning agenda with regards to the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no plans for any statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in that regards.</p>\n<p>\n\tReuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what does the President hope to achieve on his trip Wednesday and Thursday on energy?\xc2\xa0 And how do you hope or how do you plan to make it -- to avoid making it into a PR move on the President\xe2\x80\x99s energy background?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear about two things.\xc2\xa0 One, energy in general, and the price of gas in particular, is on a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s minds, understandably, right now.\xc2\xa0 Two, this President is aggressively advocating for and pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy as a matter of policy.\xc2\xa0 We will be going -- he will be going first to Boulder City, Nevada, where he will visit the Copper Mountain Solar 1 Facility, the largest photovoltaic plant operating in the country, with nearly one million solar panels powering 17,000 homes.\xc2\xa0 Why is that important?\xc2\xa0 Because of the need to continue to pursue an all-of-the-above energy approach that includes investments in alternative energy so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to oil and gas production fields located on federal lands outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, an area home to more than 70 active drilling rigs.\xc2\xa0 Why is that important?\xc2\xa0 Because an all-of-the-above energy approach requires and necessitates that we aggressively expand domestic oil and gas production in a safe and responsible way.\xc2\xa0 This President has done that.\xc2\xa0 We have seen oil and gas production at eight-year highs.\xc2\xa0 Even on federal lands, oil production is up 13 percent over the last three years.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to continuing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen he will travel to the Cushing, Oklahoma area to discuss his administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to improving and supporting infrastructure that helps us leverage our domestic resources while also ensuring these projects are developed in a safe and responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou all, of course, are familiar with the Cushing-to-the-Gulf pipeline, why that is necessary -- because we have actually a glut of oil that\'s bottled up because of the lack of infrastructure necessary to move the product to the Gulf, to the refineries there.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on that, and this part of an all-of-the-above approach that is the only way we can enhance our energy security.</p>\n<p>\n\tDrilling alone is not an answer.\xc2\xa0 If it were, we would have solved the problem -- because as I just said, we have been increasing domestic oil and gas production, increasing the amount of drilling that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in this country on federal lands and in federal waters, and we will continue to do so, but with a very small portion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s known reserves but a huge demand for oil on the world market, we need to diversify our approach.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an approach that I think a broad majority of the American people would also support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he and you and others have been talking about that all-of-the-above strategy for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Is the point of going on a trip like this where he can be photographed in front of solar panels or pipes an opportunity to try and sell that more?\xc2\xa0 Is that essentially what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President travels around the country -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s for the Recovery Act, or for the need to have a Consumer Protection Bureau, or investments in alternative energy, or investments in oil and gas production -- it\xe2\x80\x99s to focus attention on an agenda that requires not just his leadership, but cooperation and leadership by members of Congress, so that we can get more done to advance a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy policy that is the only policy that will ensure that we have greater independence from the need for foreign sources of energy in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is an active agenda, an active policy agenda that he very much looks forward to highlighting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more topic, just real quickly.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow night -- or tomorrow is the FEC filing deadline.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, White House officials have started appearing at Priorities USA Action events. Can you tell us how many events they have -- or who, number one, and how many events they\xe2\x80\x99ve attended, and how it\xe2\x80\x99s gone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that information.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a bit.\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the active agenda he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be calling on Congress to do on energy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we need congressional help to continue to pursue the all-of-the-above approach.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\'s increasing oil and gas production, increasing investments and sustaining investments in alternative energy, the need to highlight this I think is apparent in this time when we are facing high gas prices at the pump.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of people, rightfully, want to know what the strategy is to ensure that this doesn\'t happen again and again, annually or biannually, as it\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in the recent past.\xc2\xa0 So the President is very focused on this, as I think a lot of Americans would expect him to be.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of the trip is to make clear what we can do, what we are doing, and the kinds of approaches that are necessary to enhance our energy security in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney says today that the economy is coming back, something I don\'t think you\xe2\x80\x99d disagree with.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the economic recovery has now reached a level where it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of inevitable?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on a path where it\xe2\x80\x99s only going to get better?\xc2\xa0 Does that make it less of an argument during the election year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President absolutely does not believe that recovery is inevitable.\xc2\xa0 We need to do everything we can here in Washington to ensure that the recovery continues.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly within the capacity of Washington, as we have seen in the past, most recently last summer, to take action that can harm the recovery.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t let that happen.\xc2\xa0 So, no, the recovery is not so far along now that it can continue without leaders in Washington making the right decisions and taking the right actions to ensure that we can continue to grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe transportation bill is a perfect example of that.\xc2\xa0 Failure to advance a bipartisan transportation bill, the kind of bipartisan transportation bill that -- as you know, Ann, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered this -- that has been passed frequently over the years, would result in the halting of numerous construction projects around the country, would result in job loss, instead of job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can\'t let that happen.\xc2\xa0 So, no, Washington needs to continue to focus on doing what it can to help the recovery continue.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last three years, there are choices you make in the face of a recession like the one we encountered in 2009 that can either double down on the policies that got you into the mess to begin with, or chart a course towards recovery.\xc2\xa0 The President made a lot of hard choices in his first couple of years in office that have led us to where we are today, which is a period of sustained economic growth that needs to continue and needs to expand -- a period of 24 months or 23 months of private sector job creation that needs to continue because, as you know, even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve in these past 24 months seen the creation of nearly 4 million private sector jobs, the hole dug by the great recession was something like 8 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think I promised Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the question of legislation, so there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a piece of legislation he\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\xe2\x80\x99re calling on Congress to do what?\xc2\xa0 Come up with a piece of legislation on this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t have a specific agenda to put forward to you for Congress to take action on.\xc2\xa0 Congress has within its capacity, as the transportation bill points out -- the opportunity to help economic growth continue and the opportunity to, at least potentially, restrain growth or reverse it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about Scott\'s question --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But, in general.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a list of items that Congress could act on.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is we need to -- we\'ve talked about this within the context of the President\'s We Can\'t Wait agenda, which is, he will act on all the things he can -- big, medium and small -- that don\'t require congressional collaboration -- often because we\'ve had a paucity of congressional cooperation and collaboration.\xc2\xa0 But he\xc2\xa0 -- but there are things that we need to do with Congress, and he\'ll continue to do that -- whether it\'s on energy, or transportation, or the job creation measures of the jobs act that have yet to be passed, or the startup legislation that he put forward.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a whole host of areas where we need congressional cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given what you\'re trying to do with this trip, how much of this -- I mean, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we view it as solely a public relations stunt?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can view -- you can easily --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- I mean, not meant to be cynical about this, but to look at -- it seems to be a point-by-point rebuttal of the attacks that you\'re getting on Capitol Hill regarding -- whether it\'s Keystone, regarding solar and clean energy.\xc2\xa0 It seems that it\'s like this trip is designed to rebut political --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So the idea that the President\'s focus on an issue that has a lot of Americans concerned I think is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 The idea that he has a comprehensive, all-of-the-above approach to our energy challenges I think is appropriate to highlight.\xc2\xa0 There is certainly a longstanding tradition of Presidents traveling around the country to highlight the agenda that they\'re pursuing, their policy agenda.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he\'s going to be doing on this trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause it is so important, both in the present and for the future, that we pursue this all-of-the-above approach to our energy challenges, because if we don\'t, we\'re going to see these kinds of scenarios year after year, where prices go up, politicians say, well, I\'ve got a plan -- especially in an election year -- to lower the prices at the pump.\xc2\xa0 Often the plan is just to drill more, which there\'s not a single energy expert out there who would argue that that\'s a solution.\xc2\xa0 We need something bigger than that, and broader, and that\'s what the President is highlighting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that what you\'re actually doing?\xc2\xa0 Because now gas prices are up, so you\'re getting attention for it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not like you were out there doing these trips when --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a veteran of a lot of trips focused on -- as part of this trip is -- on investments that this administration has made in alternative energy, I beg to differ.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of three years, the President has made those trips, the Vice President has made those trips.\xc2\xa0 He has also -- they\'ve also made trips focused on other aspects of his energy agenda, not just recently.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Victoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your message to the Pakistani government as they meet tomorrow to talk about their relationship with the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our message hasn\'t changed, which is that we consider that relationship very important, not least because of its importance to our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 It is a complicated relationship that requires a lot of attention, and we give it that attention.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with Pakistan on our shared goals of eradicating the threat of terrorism in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no question, as I\'ve mentioned before, that the cooperation that we have had from Pakistan has contributed to some of the successes that we have had in taking the fight to al Qaeda, in eliminating senior al Qaeda leadership from -- removing senior al Qaeda leadership from the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue to work with Pakistan to pursue that agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The anger about drone attacks is not going away.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that you can do about that with Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 And again, also with night raids with Afghanistan -- what is the situation on that with your negotiations with the Afghan government?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think I said on Friday with regards to Afghanistan and the President\'s phone conversation, recent phone conversation early Friday morning with President Karzai, we continue to have conversations with the Afghan government about that issue and are focused very much on implementing a strategy that includes transferring combat lead to Afghan security forces in 2013 with the aim of ultimately transferring all lead authority to Afghan security forces by 2014, in accordance with NATO\'s agreement in Lisbon.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Pakistan, again, without addressing the specifics of your question, we understand that there are challenges in the relationship.\xc2\xa0 We work very closely with our Pakistani counterparts and we are very clear about what our objectives are in terms of American national security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just follow on the gas prices?\xc2\xa0 Because when there was a jobs crisis in the fall, the President decided, look, let\'s write a bill, pass this bill now.\xc2\xa0 Now there\'s a gas price crisis.\xc2\xa0 Why is there not a bill that he\'s traveling around the country saying, pass this now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as he\'s made clear, there\'s not a bill that will lower prices at the pump.\xc2\xa0 There is not a 3-point plan, a 1-point plan or a 5-point plan that would lower gas prices at the pump, because oil is a global commodity; its price fluctuates globally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we need to do is not pretend that there is some silver bullet solution, but focus on a broad agenda that is aimed at increasing production of fossil fuels in the United States, expanding our investments in alternative energy, taking the kind of administrative action he took, working with major automobile companies to increase our fuel-efficiency standards to the point that American consumers will save $1.7 trillion and 12 billion barrels of oil over the course of that program\'s implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the kind of approach that we need to take.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the kind of approach that he\'s going to highlight on this trip.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important because the American people need to know that there is no easy solution to this challenge, that we need to maintain an across-the-board effort on all these areas of the energy economy, or else we will not get out of this predicament in the long run, which we have to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 On Ben\'s question about health care -- it\'s supposed to be the President\'s signature domestic achievement, so the idea that he may not speak about this on the anniversary seems odd.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder, with the polling data -- I think ABC News has a poll out today -- when you add it up, 67 percent of the public either wants to throw out the whole bill or just throw out the mandate, not the whole bill.\xc2\xa0 The White House has been talking for two years about educating the public, talking about the benefits of this.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t this polling data suggest that people are not buying it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the polling data suggest in part the hundreds of millions of dollars that was spent attacking it.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'re focusing on is implementing it so that more and more Americans see the benefits that it brings.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t make any announcement one way or the other about what the President\'s schedule will hold on this issue, but we are focused on implementing the bill, not on discussing anniversaries, particularly -- although I\'m sure others will want to discuss this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think if you look at or talk to Americans and look at some of the data on this, if you ask them, is the alternative as proposed by some folks who oppose the Affordable Care Act -- giving power back to the insurance companies so that they can throw you off your insurance policy if you develop an illness, or prevent you from getting insurance if you have a preexisting condition, or prevent young Americans from staying on their parent\'s insurance policy -- I think the answer will be, no, we don\'t want that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that efforts to -- calls to take that away, to take those positive changes away from average Americans will be met with a great deal of skepticism when people talk about this and focus on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is going to continue to focus on the economy, on jobs, on energy policy, and let others have that debate if they want to have it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 The President signed an executive order on Friday about disaster preparedness.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been some online commentary suggesting this gives the executive branch power to allocate energy, food, water in either peacetime or wartime.\xc2\xa0 And there are conservative blogs that are pushing the notion that this suggests the White House is preparing for war with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what this executive order was?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I cannot explain that reaction to it.\xc2\xa0 I think it was a fairly standard and routine piece of business.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s approach to our dealings with Iran, I think, has been made clear.\xc2\xa0 He has made it clear, most recently, when he discussed it at length a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are aggressively pursuing a policy focused on tightening sanctions against Iran, increasing the pressure on Iran, and increasing the isolation of the Iranian regime, because this President believes we have the time and space to do that, to see if that diplomatic approach and sanctions approach can produce the desired result -- because, as he said from this podium, it\'s easy to talk about war, but you need to talk about the potential implications and consequences of war.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe takes no option off the table in dealing with Iran, but he\'s focused on this diplomatic avenue because not only do we have the time and space to do so, but it is ultimately the approach that has the best chance, if successful, of ensuring that Iran does not ever build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the approach he\'s taking.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 After several weeks, now, of events and speeches and travel focused around the President\'s energy policies, polls seem to be somewhat inconclusive.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering what evidence you\'ve seen to show that it\'s swaying public opinion, or what effect it\'s having with the broader public.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The point is not -- I\'m not sure I get the point of your question.\xc2\xa0 Energy is an important issue.\xc2\xa0 It is a huge issue for our economy going forward.\xc2\xa0 It is a huge issue for our national security going forward.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on it for those reasons.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that Americans are very concerned, and should be, about the prices that they\'re paying at the pump.\xc2\xa0 And this President is very focused on that, and he understands the hardship that that causes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons why he fought so hard both last year and this year to have a payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans is so that that extra money could be in the pockets of everyday Americans and enable them to deal with the expense caused by higher gas prices.\xc2\xa0 That was true at this time last year, and is true, obviously, this year.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a focus of this President\'s for that reason and those reasons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also part of a broader argument about where we need to move economically as a country.\xc2\xa0 And enhancing our energy independence is very much a part of a vision this President has for a stronger, more secure America in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 So he\'s talking about it for those reasons as well.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\'t really have much of an effect, I imagine, on today\'s polling data, but it does have an effect on our long-term economic viability.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he is defending his energy policies in the face of rising gasoline prices, and so, are Americans buying that defense?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I mean, I would just give you the same answer.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not -- it is wholly understandable that Americans are concerned about the prices they\'re paying at their local gas station.\xc2\xa0 Prices are very high.\xc2\xa0 And what I think this President has made clear is Americans, I think, by and large, even though they\'re frustrated, understand that politicians who tell them that if only they were in power they could fix it with a simple proposal -- most Americans understand that that\'s baloney; that it\'s not plausible, it\'s laughable as policy; that "drill, drill, drill" will not get you anywhere, because if it could then the fact that we\'ve increased oil and gas production in this country would have resulted in a decrease in prices at the pump, not an increase.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is there is not a direct correlation there because it\'s a global commodity and the price of oil globally is affected by a number of factors, including economic growth in China, India, Brazil, and other countries, as well as this one, and by a lack of stability in various regions of the world.\xc2\xa0 So to reduce the effect that fluctuations have in this country we need to take an all-of-the-above approach to our energy policy, and that\'s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon-Christopher, and then Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the earlier statement by Tommy Vietor regarding the attacks in Toulouse, France, this morning.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in contact with President Sarkozy of France to express his thoughts and concerns regarding this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any calls to read out to foreign leaders today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims and to the French people over this incident.\xc2\xa0 But beyond the statement we put out, I don\'t have anything else for you at this time on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Syria, what is the next move for the U.S. there?\xc2\xa0 The President has frequently talked about how we\'re keeping up the pressure, that it\'s just a matter of time before Assad will go, yet the violence continues and Assad remains in power.\xc2\xa0 So what\'s the next move?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are continuing to work with a broad international coalition to isolate the Assad regime, put pressure on the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We are also strongly supportive of Kofi Annan\xe2\x80\x99s mission.\xc2\xa0 We are helping with our partners to ensure that sanctions against the regime are enforced globally, and we are continuing to work with our partners to provide humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is vital for every country to understand that the kind of brutality perpetrated by the Assad regime against the Syrian people puts Assad on the wrong side of history, and supporting that regime is the wrong way to go, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d and our international partners on this issue to continue to put pressure on Assad, to continue to call on Assad to cease the violence, and to provide humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point are all of those things not enough -- putting on the pressure, calling on Assad to cease the violence\xc2\xa0 -- if the violence continues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President has addressed this issue as have I.\xc2\xa0 Specifically if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, for example, about providing arms, we still believe that it is not the right approach to take to contribute to the militarization of the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We make the point that as we deal with the upheavals and countries across the region, we look at them very specifically.\xc2\xa0 Each country is different.\xc2\xa0 The circumstances in each country is different.\xc2\xa0 The comparison is often made in questions that were asked to the situation in Libya, and the differences I think are often spelled out.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict in the future at what point, if certain things happen or don\xe2\x80\x99t happen, additional strategies might be put in place.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re taking now is the one we believe is the right one -- working with the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d working with the international community -- to further isolate and pressure Assad, helping with our allies to provide humanitarian assistance, and hopefully further uniting the international community against the Assad regime because of its brutality.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then a quick question on gas prices.\xc2\xa0 In this election year the President is not concerned that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting the blame for the $4.00-plus per gallon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you want to -- I mean, election questions and campaign questions you should direct to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, let\'s take out "election."\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned -- is he not concerned that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting the blame from the public or from --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is not concerned about who gets the blame.\xc2\xa0 The President is concerned about making sure we have the right policies to deal with this challenge for the long term. I think that a number of you and your colleagues have clearly pointed out the hollowness of some of the proposals put forward by those who are critics of the President masquerading as energy policies.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not plausible because you simply cannot drill your way out of this problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder this President, oil and gas production in the United States has increased significantly, both on private and on public lands.\xc2\xa0 Under this President, we have signed a permit to build the first nuclear power plant in 30 years.\xc2\xa0 Under this President, we have taken a path through investments that will ensure that we double the amount of renewable energy produced in this country.\xc2\xa0 Under this President, we have put in place historic fuel-efficiency standards that will do more to reduce our consumption of oil and, therefore, our dependence on foreign oil than a whole host of proposals that others have put out there, which they pretend will somehow lower the price at the pump next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not an easy challenge, and the President is being very honest with the American people about what we need to do to ensure that we deal with this challenge for the long term.\xc2\xa0 So poll numbers and how people view this I think are one thing.\xc2\xa0 Getting the policy right is another, and it is a more important thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, the Ryan budget is going to be coming out tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you in advance of it about two things that are clearly going to be in it?\xc2\xa0 One is the call to basically reopen negotiations on the spending caps to cut another $19 billion out of discretionary funding.\xc2\xa0 And of course, the overall question about Medicare, reaping very substantial savings off of that -- what do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait to see what\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\xc2\xa0 I think that the calls to abrogate -- to violate an agreement that everybody signed onto in August, I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about before, has to raise questions about keeping your word, about where we are.\xc2\xa0 This was the result of serious negotiations that ended in significant reductions in discretionary spending, nondefense discretionary spending, as well as defense spending.\xc2\xa0 And I think a lot of elected officials in Congress of both parties have said we need to keep our word and keep that agreement in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s another aspect of this that has been discussed about blowing up the sequester, another agreement -- handshake, signature -- that suddenly folks want to undo because they find it inconvenient.\xc2\xa0 The sequester was designed to be objectionable and onerous -- both the cuts in defense spending and nondefense spending.\xc2\xa0 No one wants to see them go into place.\xc2\xa0 They exist in order to force Congress to try to deal with the challenge that is presented before it in the need to get our fiscal house in order, to enact further legislation that would reduce our long-term deficits and debt, and to do that, this President believes, in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s the approach that needs to be taken here.\xc2\xa0 What we don\'t need -- and again, I will have to see the details of it -- what we don\'t need is another proposal that says we have to preserve and extend tax cuts for the very wealthiest of Americans who have done extremely well in the last decade, we have to preserve tax subsidies and breaks for oil and gas companies that are enjoying record profits, subsidies that have been in place for a century -- that\'s taxpayers giving money to oil and gas companies making record profits.\xc2\xa0 I mean that -- think that\'s a tough sell.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in order to pay for all that and achieve some modicum of deficit reduction, basically ending Medicare as we know it, asking seniors to pay a heck of a lot more -- that\'s just not an approach this President supports.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the specifics are when it comes out, but if the past is prologue, it\xe2\x80\x99s not very promising.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there was a lot of attention over the weekend to the killing of a Florida teenager by a neighborhood watch -- the police know who shot him -- and under very troubling circumstances -- the police know who shot him.\xc2\xa0 No arrest has been made, no charges filed.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of this case of Trayvon Martin, and has he asked the Justice Department to look into it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we here in the White House are aware of the incident, and we understand that the local FBI office has been in contact with the local authorities and is monitoring the situation.\xc2\xa0 Our thoughts and prayers go out to Trayvon Martin\xe2\x80\x99s family, but obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to wade into a local law enforcement matter.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Justice Department and to local law enforcement at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President himself expressed any comments about it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the case of Professor Gates up in Cambridge pales compared to this, and the President did speak out about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any conversations to report to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about -- on energy -- about the President is trying to be honest and trying to ask the American people to understand there\xe2\x80\x99s no silver bullet, no instant fix.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe in the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, his strategy, when would the payoff materialize to smooth out for most Americans those price jumps?\xc2\xa0 When does he envision the payoff would occur?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s, if you keep at it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that improves continually.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen our reliance on foreign imports decline in the last three years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen an increase in domestic oil production.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen increases in renewable energy production.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put into place fuel-efficiency standards that will have significant impact in terms of reducing our demand for foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 So all of these things will have a cumulative effect to reduce the portion of our energy consumption that comes from foreign sources, and by doing that, reduce the impact of fluctuations in the global oil market on average Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s the overall goal, for economic reasons and national security reasons.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a goal that recognizes a simple fact, that in the 21st century there is going to be huge demand for fossil fuels as rising economies continue to grow, and as this economy continues to grow, and there is going to be huge opportunities in -- economically, in industries that take advantage of and exploit the need for alternative energy sources.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is committed to those industries growing and thriving in this country, and creating jobs in this country, so that we don\'t get into a situation where we trade our dependence on other countries for foreign oil for a dependence on other countries for alternative fuels or alternative energy sources.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going to be -- this is a long-term focus that needs to result in less and less dependence on foreign sources of energy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 And I want to be clear that the President is very concerned about the current dilemma, and he has talked about the measures that he is taking -- asking his Justice Department to reconstitute the unit that looks into potential speculation and fraud, and the other issues that we can address here.\xc2\xa0 But he is also honest about the fact that there is no magic wand you can wave to suddenly reduce the price of gasoline at your local station.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.\xc2\xa0 Alexis, one more.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought last week that you said the President was traveling to talk about health care, and today you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that again.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember saying that, actually.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the reason that he would be traveling -- when you got questions about health care you said he would be traveling.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to look at that.\xc2\xa0 I might have just\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Slipped?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was never a plan that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of to have him travel.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I said but I\xe2\x80\x99ll check the transcript.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai was quoted as saying there are two demons in our country right now -- talking about the Taliban and U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 And then over the weekend the Afghanistan ambassador said on CNN that "Karzai is simply reflecting what our people are saying."\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of concern that President Karzai is saying one thing to the President and something different to the people of Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have regular conversations with President Karzai, with the Afghan leadership, and are fully aware of the concerns that he has and has had about some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, the last several weeks have been very challenging, and that has brought these issues to the forefront again.\xc2\xa0 We are focused on implementing our strategy -- a strategy, which has at its core both the need to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, but the need to transfer security authority -- security lead over to Afghan forces, which in turn will allow us to withdraw U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of drawing down the surge forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the President has said, withdrawals of U.S. forces will continue beyond that as we transfer more and more territory and more and more of the security responsibility to Afghan forces who are being built up as part of the implementation of his strategy.\xc2\xa0 The specifics of the footprint and where the forces will be deployed I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will be worked out.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also engaged with the Afghans in our Strategic Partnership discussions and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re very cognizant of the fact that the incidents of late have provided great challenges.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working through them, but we\xe2\x80\x99re remaining focused on what the mission is, the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re there to begin with, which is because we were attacked here in the United States as part of a plan that was hashed and conceived and authorized and executed out of Afghanistan by al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 That is the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re there and that is the reason why al Qaeda is the principal focus of our mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that type of rhetoric complicate the U.S. efforts to implement your strategy and to withdraw forces ultimately by 2014?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on our strategy.\xc2\xa0 We work with President Karzai, as I said in reading out the conversation President Obama had with President Karzai early Friday morning.\xc2\xa0 The two men see eye-to-eye on what the implementation of the strategy is in 2013, in 2014.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues that they\xe2\x80\x99re working through with regards to some of the things that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to continue to be focused on that and the implementation of the strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back on Syria, both the President and Prime Minister Cameron made a point of emphasizing both the Russia and China aspect of all this.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what kind of pressure is being exerted on both Beijing and Moscow to get past that point of the veto of the previous Security Council?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t read out to you conversations or diplomatic negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that we were very disappointed in the veto.\xc2\xa0 We have made that clear.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with everyone to focus attention on the heinous behavior of the Assad regime, the futility of siding with Assad, given the fact that his ultimate giving up of power is, we believe, only a matter of time, and the fact that the Syrian people will always remember who was with them in this terrible time and who was not. And so we\xe2\x80\x99re working with everyone to try to unite behind a strategy to pressure Assad, to isolate Assad, and ultimately to get him to stop the violence and to step aside.\xc2\xa0 Conversations continue with all countries, including those that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, all.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:46 P.M.
