Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n     1:20 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the delay.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on today, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 Before we go to your questions, there is some news I did want to discuss proactively that all of you have been covering closely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of good news about the American auto industry in today\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\xc2\xa0 And the early analysis indicates that the American auto industry has just completed a record year, and that is a pretty stark turnaround.\xc2\xa0 Those of you who have covered the administration from the beginning will recall the rather dark future that was facing the American auto industry in late 2008 and early 2009.\xc2\xa0 But since then, there has been a remarkable turnaround.\xc2\xa0 And one way to illustrate that I think is to actually look at some of the reporting that has been done by outlets represented in this room and, in some cases, journalists who are represented in this room.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     So let\xe2\x80\x99s start in January of 2009 -- I think we have some graphics here.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times, in January of 2009, had a headline that said, \xe2\x80\x9cMarkets Declined as Auto Sales Plummet.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But earlier this week, they reported that \xe2\x80\x9cAuto Industry Sales Explode In An Ever-Changing Market.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n     The next slide has a Reuters report that notes that \xe2\x80\x9cU.S. 2009 auto sales is at a 27-year low.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But yesterday, Reuters reported that auto sales in 2015 set a record after a strong December.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     The next slide is USA Today -- it covered extensively that in January of 2009 they noted that in 2008 auto sales dropped by 3 million.\xc2\xa0 But then yesterday, they noted that auto sales had soared to a record high by increasing 9 percent year over year.</p>\n<p>\n     There were newsprint outlets who were noting this.\xc2\xa0 CBS News had also reported that U.S. auto sales fell 18 percent in 2008, but yesterday, they noted, as others did, that auto sales cruised to a new high in 2015.</p>\n<p>\n     Last, but certainly not least is The Washington Post.\xc2\xa0 They noted in January 2009 that \xe2\x80\x9cU.S. auto sales fell 36 percent in December.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But they reported yesterday -- I believe it was in today\xe2\x80\x99s paper -- that U.S. auto sales hit a record high in 2015.</p>\n<p>\n     So it\'s been a pretty stark turnaround.\xc2\xa0 And in many ways, the auto industry is the best way to illustrate how strongly the U.S. economy has come back since the depths of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n     Now, a key part of this was a decision that the President made in his first couple of months in office to bail out the American auto industry.\xc2\xa0 This is something of which the American public was deeply skeptical.\xc2\xa0 Before the President officially took office in December of 2008, there was a CNN poll, Jim, that showed that 61 percent of those surveyed opposed government assistance for major U.S. automakers.\xc2\xa0 A Gallup poll from a similar time period found that 51 percent, a very slim majority of Americans, opposed the federal government giving major financial assistance to the Big Three U.S. auto companies.\xc2\xa0 That same question was opposed by 65 percent of Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n     In March of 2009, about the same time that the President was announcing his plan to bring the auto industry back, a poll found that 63 percent of Americans said extending loans to General Motors and Chrysler to help the automakers stay in business was the wrong thing for the government to do.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, that actually was the strategy that was implemented by the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 And since mid-2009, after the strategy was implemented, the U.S. auto industry has added 640,000 new jobs, the strongest growth on record for that industry over that period of time.</p>\n<p>\n     Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest about the fact that none of this would have been possible without the grit and determination and innovation of American autoworkers and the workers in industries that are critical to the success of the American auto industry.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that because of the policy decisions that were made by this administration to place a bet on those workers, America has won, and our economy has been better for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     And I think all of this is an apt illustration of what the job of being the U.S. President actually is; that when you\xe2\x80\x99re President of the United States, you\xe2\x80\x99re faced with weighty choices with significant consequences, and there will be a tendency, understandably so, to be worried about the next poll that\xe2\x80\x99s going to come out or the next news cycle, and to be conscious of how likely you are to be sharply criticized for the decision that you make in the immediate aftermath of that decision.\xc2\xa0 But the best Americans Presidents ensure the strength of this country by looking beyond the next news cycle or the next poll, or even the next election, and focusing on the long term.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a clearer case study of that approach to presidential leadership than the kinds of decisions that President Obama made early in 2009, and the results of those decisions that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing here in early 2016.</p>\n<p>\n     So with that long windup, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take additional questions about the success of the American auto industry, or anything else that may be on your mind.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible I may have exhausted any questions that you may have about this topic.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I think that is merely an endorsement of my opening statement.\xc2\xa0 So either way, I win -- I think.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     But, Josh, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to turn to North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I thought you might.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about the North Korean auto industry.\xc2\xa0 I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s not doing very well.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. determined whether there was a nuclear test, what kind of a test it was, and whether it was successful?</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, this is a serious subject.\xc2\xa0 The initial analysis that\xe2\x80\x99s been conducted of the events that were reported overnight is not consistent with North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test.\xc2\xa0 There is nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s occurred in the last 24 hours that has caused the United States government to change our assessment of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s technical and military capabilities.</p>\n<p>\n     Now, I hasten to add that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing the work necessary to learn more about the nuclear test that North Korea conducted last night.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen by now the extensive independent analysis that\xe2\x80\x99s been done in the United States and in other countries that includes significant and understandable skepticism of the claims of the North Korean regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to continue to look at this by monitoring the situation, assessing the available data and evidence.\xc2\xa0 But the initial analysis is not consistent with the claims that the regime has made of a successful hydrogen bomb test.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, at this point, can you rule out that it was an H-bomb?\xc2\xa0 Or just, so far, you haven\'t seen that --</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Based on this initial analysis that has been completed, the initial analysis indicates that the initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regardless of what this was, it was clearly a provocative act.\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, every time that North Korea does something like that and we all have this response about what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do about it, there seems to be some lack of confidence that the options that we have available to us through the U.N., such as sanctions, are really up to the job of stopping North Korea from going down this path.\xc2\xa0 We slap some new sanctions on them, and they basically ignore it and keep doing what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House confident that the new sanctions that you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for today at the Security Council, for example, are capable of securing your goal of preventing North Korea from becoming a nuclear state?</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right to point out that any kind of nuclear test like the one that North Korea conducted last night is provocative and a flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions -- not just one, but any number of them.\xc2\xa0 And based on reports of that nuclear test, both the United States and Japan called an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting.\xc2\xa0 That meeting did recently conclude, and the result of that meeting was that additional measures against North Korea would be considered for the violation of their international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n     What is true is that North Korea continues to be one of the most isolated nations in the world.\xc2\xa0 And their isolation has only deepened as they have sought to engage in increasingly provocative acts.\xc2\xa0 These include not just nuclear tests, but some of the ballistic missile tests that have attracted some attention over the years, as well.\xc2\xa0 What the United States has succeeded in doing under the leadership of President Obama is not just further isolating the North Koreans, but also cementing the international unanimity of opinion that North Korea needs to end these provocations, needs to commit to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, and demonstrate a commitment to some peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n     And it is notable that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just our stalwart allies in the Asia Pacific, like South Korea and Japan, who are voicing their disapproval of these North Korean actions, it\xe2\x80\x99s also notable that our collective statements are echoed by countries like China and Russia, with whom we don\xe2\x80\x99t always agree.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen quite strong statements from those countries that echo the sentiments that I have just relayed to you.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an indication that the interest of the United States can be successfully advanced through principled, focused, tenacious, diplomatic engagement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If sanctions and diplomacy don\xe2\x80\x99t work, is military option on the table if North Korea continues to march towards a nuclear weapon?</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, the thing that I should reiterate at this point is the rock-solid commitment on the part of the United States to the safety and security of our allies in South Korea. \xc2\xa0That commitment also extends to the safety and security of our allies in Japan.\xc2\xa0 And we have demonstrated our significant investment in that security relationship, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubting the strength of that commitment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     But, at this point, what we want the North Koreans to do -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean the United States, I mean our allies and our partners in the Six-Party Talks -- is we want the North Koreans to end their provocative acts both in the form of missile tests and nuclear tests, to commit to denuclearization, and to demonstrate a commitment to pursuing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking them to do that out of charity.\xc2\xa0 We actually also believe that that would be in the interest of the North Korean people and certainly the broader region.\xc2\xa0 And that was the goal of the Six-Party Talks.\xc2\xa0 And we would like the North Koreans to begin to orient their public posture and their behavior in the direction of constructive international engagement.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other topic, I wanted to ask you about an internal timeline from the State Department on the political transition for Syria that was obtained by the AP.\xc2\xa0 And maybe you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the document itself, which lays out March 17th as -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- March 2017 as the best-case scenario for when President Assad would relinquish his office.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it\xe2\x80\x99s fair at this point to say that the White House does not envision a scenario where President Assad leaves office prior to the time that the President does.</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear in our view that Bashar al-Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead the country of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t just say that out of our moral objection to the way he has violently attacked his own people.\xc2\xa0 I say that as an observation about his inability to lead a country where most of the citizens have been victims of his violence.\xc2\xa0 It would just be impossible for somebody who had that much blood on their hands to succeed in uniting and governing that country successfully.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that we find his actions morally repugnant, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, as a practical matter, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to lead that country and unify it in a way that we can bring it into the political chaos, that we can begin to address the significant security situation inside of Syria that has allowed a terrorist organization like ISIL to gain a foothold, we can begin to address the root causes of the millions of people that have fled their homes inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of problems, and they all trace back to Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to envision a scenario in which he could succeed, even just as a practical matter, in leading that country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have always envisioned a political transition that includes Bashar al-Assad leaving power, and the Syrian people having some say over the future of their country.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position where they have to choose between a dictator and a brutal terrorist organization running their country.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is really about the timing.\xc2\xa0 Do you see any chance for that happening before this presidency is over?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set a timeline for it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process that is being painstakingly negotiated right now.\xc2\xa0 This is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the U.N.\xc2\xa0 But we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made as much progress as we have thus far without the leadership of Secretary Kerry in his efforts to bring the international community together to be engage in these talks.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States is obviously invested in seeing these political and diplomatic discussions make some progress.\xc2\xa0 But I would -- given all the starts and stops that we have seen as this political transition process has been pursued, I\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant to make any public predictions about when certain mile posts will be reached.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ayesha.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to North Korea, has the U.S. deployed equipment that would detect a vapor that would tell us about the nature of the nuclear test, an authenticity of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s claims?\xc2\xa0 Or do you plan -- or does the U.S. plan on launching such equipment?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ayesha, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to share with you.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the United States will be collecting additional evidence and conducting an additional analysis to learn more about the nuclear test that North Korea conducted last night.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be working closely with our allies and partners in the region who have their own capabilities that can be brought to this collection and analysis of data.\xc2\xa0 And as we have more analysis to share, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do that.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you talk a bit about what -- as the United States and U.N. are considering additional options in light of this action by North Korea, what could be done as far as sanctions?\xc2\xa0 You talked about earlier how the country is already isolated, already very poor.\xc2\xa0 What actions -- what additional sanctions could actually be taken?\xc2\xa0 And then also, could you talk a bit about -- it seems that China would have to play a major role in enforcing any sanctions against North Korea for them to really take effect.\xc2\xa0 So can you talk a bit -- has the U.S. reached out to China on that issue?\xc2\xa0 What would the U.S. like to see China do in response to the action from North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Both of these are very good questions.\xc2\xa0 Let me start with the first one, which is the United Nations Security Council right now is taking a look at what additional steps can be taken, what additional measures can be deployed to further isolate the North Koreans as a result of their provocative acts.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right, North Korea is a country whose citizens are enduring extreme poverty and extreme isolation from the international community.\xc2\xa0 All of that is a result of the failed leadership of the North Korean regime.\xc2\xa0 And the international community is united in insisting that the North Korean regime needs to end their provocative acts, end the missile tests, end the nuclear tests, and actually commit to a process of pursuing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 Then we could start to see North Korea emerge as a constructive participant in the international community.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We obviously would welcome that development.\xc2\xa0 It would be good for the nation of North Korea.\xc2\xa0 It would be even better for the people of North Korea.\xc2\xa0 There also would be obvious benefits for the broader region of Northeast Asia.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the direction that we\xe2\x80\x99re headed.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the significant role that China will play in all of this.\xc2\xa0 The subject of North Korea and their repeated violations of their international obligations is something that the President discusses with his counterpart just about every time they get on the phone or meet in person.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that the two leaders discussed when President Xi was at the White House this past fall, and there was an agreement out of that meeting that neither the United States, nor China will accept North Korea as a nuclear-weapons state.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, that is a testament to how unified the international community is on this issue.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of things on which the United States and China disagree, and all of you have spent some time talking about those disagreements when President Xi was in Washington.\xc2\xa0 But this is an issue on which we do agree, and that agreement is significant because of the important role that China plays as a neighbor of North Korea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that -- there already have been conversations between U.S. officials and Chinese officials.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, recently completed a conversation with the Chinese ambassador to the United States to discuss this very issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, when I say \xe2\x80\x9cjust finished,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean shortly before I walked out here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this was --</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is Susan Rice, the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, and the Chinese ambassador to the United States.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the United States and other allies, meaning China and Russia, are condemning what happened in North Korea and that additional sanctions may come down the road.\xc2\xa0 What good, though, does that do when it comes to North Korea?\xc2\xa0 This is already the most isolated regime in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\'s already facing crippling sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What more can you do to North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think what we can do is basically make clear to them that there is only one path out of the extreme poverty and isolation that they currently face.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not a path that is advanced by pursuing nuclear weapons; it is actually a path that they can follow by ending their provocative acts, ending the missile tests, ending the nuclear tests, and demonstrating some sort of commitment to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 That is the path that North Korea has to escape the poverty and isolation that has led millions of North Koreans to suffer needlessly.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Hillary Clinton put out a statement a little while ago saying that the Chinese need to be tougher.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with that?\xc2\xa0 Do the Chinese need to be tougher with North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I can tell you that the United States is committed to working closely with the international community, including the Chinese, who obviously have significant influence here, to try to address the situation and to make it clear to the North Koreans what their options are, and to describe to them the situation that I just described.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they have a more constructive role, would you say?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly are going to be talking with China about what role we believe they can play.\xc2\xa0 But, look, Jim, the Chinese were definitive.\xc2\xa0 President Xi was definitive when he visited with President Obama here at the White House last fall that China will not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is the position of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to work together as the world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest economies, two of the more influential nations in the world, and we\'re going to work together to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that we\'ll also be working with our allies in South Korea and our allies in Japan -- there aren\'t also a lot of things that Japan, South Korea, and China agree on, but yet this is one of them.\xc2\xa0 So there is a lot of -- there\xe2\x80\x99s unanimity of opinion here about what North Korea needs to do.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And earlier today, Speaker Ryan described the executive actions that were laid out by the President yesterday as a distraction.\xc2\xa0 What did you make of that?\xc2\xa0 I guess the Speaker is trying to say that what you announced yesterday won\'t really amount to much and that this is an attempt to distract the country from problems in the country right now.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a lot of different ways I guess I could --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pretty heartfelt statement that was made by the President yesterday and the Speaker comes out and says, well, it was a distraction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess you probably would have to ask the Speaker what he was talking about.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- again, I think as was evident from his comments yesterday, does believe the fact that 30,000 Americans are killed by guns every year that this is a significant problem and that there are some common-sense things that can be done to prevent gun violence.\xc2\xa0 And the President is determined to take action where he can.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President announced yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     One of those common-sense steps is closing the gun show loophole, something that, in 2013, Speaker Ryan described as \xe2\x80\x9cobvious and very reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But I did note that in his news conference today, he said \xe2\x80\x9cthere isn\'t a loophole.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So, as confusing as his declaration about a distraction is, it\'s a quite alarming reversal of opinion for him to say that the gun show loopholes are a reasonable issue and it\'s \xe2\x80\x9cobvious that it should be addressed,\xe2\x80\x9d and now three years later, he\xe2\x80\x99s denying that it even exists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     So I guess there are a lot of questions that are raised by Mr. Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s comments today.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President met with Speaker Ryan yet, personally, since he became Speaker?</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had any face-to-face conversations.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that --</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like the relationship is off to a very good start.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been hammering the Republicans pretty consistently, and then the Speaker comes out today and makes this comment today.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like the relationship is off to a promising start.</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think the legislative success that we saw at the end of last year I think is a testament to the ability of the President and the Speaker to work together to try to find common ground in some areas.\xc2\xa0 The budget agreement was obviously significant.\xc2\xa0 We feel good about the results of that process.\xc2\xa0 It certainly was a compromise process, but it was one that was important nonetheless.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     We\'ve seen significant reform of the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Child Left Behind\xe2\x80\x9d law enacted.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen reforms to the IMF that the President has sought for five or six years now finally be approved by the Congress.\xc2\xa0 To say nothing of the transportation bill that Democrats and Republicans have long sought.\xc2\xa0 All of that has happened since Speaker Ryan took office. And I do think that is an indication that there is an actual ability of the two leaders to work together.</p>\n<p>\n     But there is no denying that there are significant differences on a range of policy issues and certainly a commitment to reducing gun violence would be one of them.\xc2\xa0 But Speaker Ryan, at the same time, has noted a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 We need to do more to enforce gun laws and we need to expand access to mental health care to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 We agree.\xc2\xa0 And there will be an opportunity for Speaker Ryan to actually do what he says.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully he will when it comes to those issues.</p>\n<p>\n     Mara.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one question about guns.\xc2\xa0 A lot has been made out of the fact that many of these recent mass shooters got their guns legally, passed background checks.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that would certainly decrease the number of victims is a ban on assault weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really talked about that recently.\xc2\xa0 I know it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere in Congress, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that anymore.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President has been focused on lately are actions that he can take using his own executive authority.\xc2\xa0 And it is not possible, using only his executive authority, for the President to reinstate the assault weapons ban, but it surely is something that the President supports.\xc2\xa0 Over the last couple of weeks -- or the last month or so, that\xe2\x80\x99s a position of the President\xe2\x80\x99s that I\xe2\x80\x99ve repeated a couple of times, and it certainly is a position that the President continues to believe would make the country safer.\xc2\xa0 But there continues to be entrenched opposition in Congress to reinstating that ban.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     I will note -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have it in front of me, but as I recall, former President George W. Bush, when he was running for President, noted his support for reinstating the assault weapons ban.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it as much, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a position that didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously attract a whole lot of controversy, at least if it\xe2\x80\x99s a position that was held by the conservative Republican President and his progressive Democratic successor.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the point of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s town hall meeting for the President to focus on the executive actions he\xe2\x80\x99s described this week, or to talk about gun violence in a much broader way?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The goal of the town hall meeting is for the President to engage with both people who support his position on gun safety, but also to have a conversation with those who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s positions on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, the President has often said that we can disagree without being disagreeable.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to protecting our constitutional rights and protecting our kids, surely we should be able to find some common ground even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on all the particulars.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that he can have an enlightening discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be an opportunity for the President to discuss the executive actions that he announced yesterday that we do believe will make our communities safer.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m also confident that it will spark a broader conversation about additional steps that state and localities can undertake to make their communities safer about how gun manufacturers and gun dealers and gun store owners could assume greater responsibility for their actions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be a discussion of the politics of this issue, too.\xc2\xa0 After all, we do see this as a very good example of how political dysfunction on Capitol Hill has serious consequences for the safety and security of communities and kids all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Happy New Year.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Happy New Year, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any detail on how the President was informed, when he was informed about this test, and whether it was Ambassador Rice and if in this phone call with the Chinese ambassador, if she requested a conversation between President Xi and President Obama?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President has been briefed a couple of times on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the timing of the mechanisms to relay to you for how that occurred.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been thoroughly briefed on this as recently as this morning.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that before the end of the day, the President is hoping that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to speak on the phone both with Prime Minister Abe and President Park of South Korea.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working to schedule those calls -- it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the middle of the night over there.\xc2\xa0 But if those calls are completed, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to let you know.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, consulting with our allies in the region and reiterating our steadfast commitment to their security is a priority at this time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President will do personally as conversations with those two leaders.\xc2\xa0 I know that there have been a number of U.S. officials that have been in touch with their counterparts just in the last 18 hours or so.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Kerry has communicated with both his Japanese and Korean counterparts.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Carter has been in touch with his South Korean counterpart as well.\xc2\xa0 Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken will be traveling to the region next week, I believe, to discuss these issues with our partners in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is some -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of engagement and discussion of these issues that are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think all of it underscores what I was describing earlier, though, which is that the international community is united in our belief that Iran -- that the North Koreans need to end their provocative actions and commit to denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Ambassador Rice speak to the Chinese ambassador in person or on the phone?\xc2\xa0 Was he summoned here?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was summoned here, but he was here in person to speak with Ambassador Rice today.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then more broadly -- you threw Iran in there.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a good pivot because we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so much from this administration -- (laughter) -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the pun on that one, either -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so much from the administration on direct engagement, the need to speak directly to Iran is the best way to denuclearize that state or prevent it from becoming a nuclear state.\xc2\xa0 Why not the same with North Korea?\xc2\xa0 Because your critics love the talking point that Dennis Rodman is the American who\xe2\x80\x99s spent the most time with Kim Jong-un.\xc2\xa0 Why with this administration -- direct engagement not a choice?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess there are a variety of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 Each country is different, and so our approach to each country is going to be a little bit different.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s true about the North Koreans is that they -- well, they essentially acquired nuclear weapons under the previous administration, and so the President inherited a situation where he was already dealing with a nuclear-armed North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n     The situation with the Iranians was different.\xc2\xa0 And what is true now about the Iranians is that they have begun to take steps in a verifiable way to confirm that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a nuclear weapon and will not acquire one.\xc2\xa0 So there was a significant development in the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action over the holidays where the Iranians announced that they had shipped 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of their country, consistent with the obligations under the international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a significant step.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     The North Koreans already had nuclear weapons when the President took office.\xc2\xa0 What we have also seen on the part of the North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation.\xc2\xa0 In our dealings with the Iranians, the President had -- well, obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a much bigger country, a much bigger and more developed economy, and an economy with much greater and deeper economic ties all around the world.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it was much harder, again, as a practical matter, to build an international coalition to isolate the Iranians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     And it was painstaking work.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Clinton has, rightly, taken some credit for some of her work in this regard in flying around the world to convince other partners of the United States to help us enforce the sanctions that were in place against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And by applying that pressure to Iran, we gave them an incentive -- because they had a desire to reengage with the world -- they now had an incentive to start to live up to their international obligations and to verify for the international community that they had not acquired a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are just two differences.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that they underscore why a different approach was required and, ultimately, why a different approach -- an approach with Iran is on the track to success.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you just also talked about, in the case of North Korea, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted international isolation.\xc2\xa0 So adding on more sanctions only feeds into that same problem.\xc2\xa0 Outsourcing it to China, some would say, in terms of reining them in, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t prevented this type of testing.\xc2\xa0 Is it the view of this administration that the capabilities of North Korea so far just make it a nuisance -- a bad actor, but not a threat -- to the national security of the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that we take the provocations and these violations of their international obligations quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 We do have the expectation that the North Koreans will live up to U.N. Security Council resolutions and international obligations that the rest of the international community abides by.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though they don\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but the expectation of the United States and the international community is that they should.\xc2\xa0 And I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s notable that North Korea is the only country that over the last 15 years has conducted a nuclear test.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there is value to protecting the international unanimity of opinion as we pressure the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, ultimately the North Koreans will have to decide for themselves exactly how they want to reengage with the international community.\xc2\xa0 And the international community has made clear that the only way they can do that is to end their provocative acts and commit to a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying a new approach is not needed, even though the President has spent a lot of time talking about prioritizing denuclearization and a lot of time talking about refocusing on Asia.\xc2\xa0 But the policy so far has not led to the kind of reengagement and taking these actions that you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for.\xc2\xa0 So are you doubling down on that?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting that the fact that we see these provocative acts from the North Koreans is an indication that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting the results that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see yet.\xc2\xa0 But we do continue to have a steadfast commitment to the security of our allies in South Korea.\xc2\xa0 We have a steadfast commitment to the national security of our allies in Japan.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the destabilizing impact that North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s provocative acts have on the broader region.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Chinese and the Russians are concerned about that, too. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working hard to keep the international community together and to make it clear to North Korea that there\xe2\x80\x99s only one path back that will be good for the North Korean people, be good for the North Korean economy, be good for the country of North Korea in terms of their ability to engage with the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got a couple.\xc2\xa0 Just some cleanup on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Shockingly, the Republican presidential candidates have held up the latest test as evidence that President Obama has a weak foreign policy that invited North Korea to do this.\xc2\xa0 Generally weak -- weak because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately sanction Iran after the most recent thing; and that it\xe2\x80\x99s also Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s fault because she was Secretary of State at the time.\xc2\xa0 So I just wanted to give you an opportunity to respond.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any merit to any of that?\xc2\xa0 Or if not, why do you think Republicans are saying that?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that because they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win votes from conservative Republicans in the presidential primary.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way our process works, and they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to do that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of campaign rhetoric but not a lot of specific, tangible suggestions about what should be done differently.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is not unique in the context of an election.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is focused on confronting this challenge by making our national security interests the top priority.\xc2\xa0 My guess is that the priority of some of the candidates is right now focused on their presidential ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, I wanted to ask you whether the President is -- what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction is to the fact that questions are now being raised by some of Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s -- well, by one of Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s opponents about the nature of his birthplace and whether that qualifies him to run for President, and whether he in any way enjoys watching that play out?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he does, but I sure do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, it would be quite ironic if after seven or eight years of drama around the President\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate, if Republican primary voters were to choose Senator Cruz as their nominee -- somebody who actually wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born in the United States and only 18 months ago renounced his Canadian citizenship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate candidate?\xc2\xa0 Are you questioning his -- okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And then perhaps this is a question better posed for Hillary Clinton given her love of burrito bowl, but I wanted to ask you whether the White House is following the situation with Chipotle, whether you have any national health concerns about the -- as of yet, not completely understood -- the nature of the E. coli outbreak, whether you have any reaction to that at all.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of those reports, but for a detailed reaction, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I have somebody else follow up with you?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also clarify, Margaret, one thing that you and I just discussed.\xc2\xa0 North Korea is the only country in the last 15 years to test a nuclear device.\xc2\xa0 I think I said nuclear test earlier, so just trying to be precise here.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mary.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about the timing of all of this.\xc2\xa0 Did the administration have any indication that this test was happening, or was this a surprise?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was not a surprise, and I think the best way I think I can describe that to you is that about a month or so ago I was asked, based on public reports about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, about whether or not we believed they had a hydrogen bomb.\xc2\xa0 And so I expressed some skepticism of their claims at the time.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indication not just to us but to all of you and to the public of what they were up to.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But specifically, this day, this precise timing, not just that they were working on -- the timing of this you knew was coming?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that based on -- I can tell you that the United States government was not surprised.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dave.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You made a reference to the town hall meeting coming up tomorrow night and that the President wants to have a conversation about guns with those that don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him.\xc2\xa0 Can you flesh that out a little bit?\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting that to take place tomorrow night at this town hall meeting at a campus in Northern Virginia?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more detail about the event tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But the audience will include not just people who agree with the President, but also some people who have views that differ from his on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And our expectation is that when the President takes questions from the audience, that people with different kinds of views will be given the opportunity to ask a question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the journalist at CNN will decide exactly who attends and who gets called on.\xc2\xa0 But my expectation is that they think that that kind of discussion would be more interesting and more fruitful.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House exerting less control over this event and who attends than typically in the past?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that it\xe2\x80\x99s CNN that will be -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve consulted with CNN about who will be in the audience, but ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s CNN who is making the call about who will participate.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s actually typical of most of our events, that the general public is generally invited when the President is on the road and some of the people who attend will be specifically invited by the White House, but it certainly is not uncommon for the general public to be invited.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Max.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the gun orders, considering the President signed more than two dozen following Sandy Hook, how come the ones announced yesterday, it took three years for them to be developed and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out before?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Max, the process that the administration undertook to review the law and carefully consider what sort of authority the President could exercise under existing law was painstaking.\xc2\xa0 And there was a lot of work done to determine how far the President could do based on the authority that he\xe2\x80\x99s given by the law.\xc2\xa0 And the emphasis was on the kinds of actions that would actually address the problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy for criminals to get their hands on guns.\xc2\xa0 And then the question is, what is it that the President has within his authority to do about it?\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work involved that was carried out by lawyers at the Department of Justice and in close consultation with White House officials, as well, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what resulted in the announcement you saw yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what further guidance has the White House given the state of Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s Governor when it comes to his attempt at banning people on a no-fly list from purchasing guns in the state?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Max, we obviously believe this is a pretty common-sense proposal.\xc2\xa0 If the government has determined that it\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous for you to board an airplane, then it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that Congress should actually pass a law, a national law that would prevent those who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think that would be a power best for Congress, not necessarily the state of Connecticut?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the state of Connecticut has obviously\xc2\xa0 been quite aggressive in taking the kinds of common-sense steps that we believe should be implemented all across the country.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of conversations that have taken place between the administration and Governor Malloy\xe2\x80\x99s office on this issue, but we obviously believe that this is a common-sense proposal that the United States should pass and should go into effect all across the country.\xc2\xa0 The good news is that there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s at least one Republican presidential candidate who agrees that this is a good idea.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that this has to be a partisan thing.\xc2\xa0 But again, it would not be the first time that the Republican-dominated Congress has blocked a common-sense proposal that has bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Now that it seems very likely that North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests during the Obama administration, in retrospect, do you think that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy was the correct one?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Andrew, I think it is true that we have not achieved our goal, but we have succeeded in making North Korea more isolated than ever before, and the international community more united than ever before about the fact that North Korea needs to bring a halt to their nuclear activities.\xc2\xa0 The North Koreans have flagrantly violated their international obligations, including a variety of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     And, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that they have done that.\xc2\xa0 But there continues to be strong international unanimity of opinion about the correct approach here and about the steps that North Korea can take to reengage with the international community.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, the North Koreans will have to decide when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to begin taking those steps.\xc2\xa0 Right now, they apparently are under the misimpression, the wrong impression that there is a path to integrating into the international community that can be pursued by developing nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re just wrong about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     And the United States is not the only country to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about that.\xc2\xa0 China, Russia, South Korea, Japan all agree.\xc2\xa0 And what we seek is a North Korea that is prepared to\xc2\xa0 renounce their nuclear intentions, abide by their international obligations, and actually pursue the kind of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula that would actually benefit the North Korean people.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While you wait for North Korea to try and change their calculus, it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s a cycle developing.\xc2\xa0 North Korea tests something, there are more sanctions; they test again, there are more sanctions, all the while, it develops more and more dangerous technology.\xc2\xa0 I mean, where is the red line?\xc2\xa0 Is it attacking South Korea?\xc2\xa0 Is it developing a hydrogen bomb?\xc2\xa0 Is it miniaturizing that bomb, putting it on a warhead and pointing it at the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 I mean, where is the line?</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is no denying the U.S. commitment to protecting the national security of our allies in South Korea. There are thousands of U.S. military personnel on the Korean Peninsula right now who can testify to that fact.\xc2\xa0 And what I can say is that we continue to be confident in our ability to protect the United States from the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s emanating from North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that resolving this situation would resolve a lot of the instability in Northeast Asia right now.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a good thing for our allies and partners in Asia.</p>\n<p>\n     Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Happy New Year.</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Same to you.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on something Margaret was asking, and that is, is the broader strategy vis-\xc3\xa0-vis North Korea working, given that since 2009 there\xe2\x80\x99s been no conversation?\xc2\xa0 Is it working, would you say, or not working?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have not yet seen the kinds of results that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 But what we have succeeded in doing is making North Korea more isolated than ever before, and the international community more united than ever before; that North Koreans need to end their provocative acts, give up their nuclear program, and actually commit to a process that will bring greater peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n     Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it your view that the President bears some responsibility for this, based on the fact that they haven\'t been talking to North Korea, the Six-Party Talks haven\'t been moving forward?\xc2\xa0 Is there any responsibility from this perspective, the U.S., given the fact that actors like Assad and Putin and Un and even Iran continue to sort of poke their finger in the chest of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n     MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the situation that we see.\xc2\xa0 What we have succeeded in doing is actually ensuring that Iran will not be able to develop a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     Bashar al-Assad is in a situation where his country has been torn apart by his own failed leadership.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, the international community is sitting down thanks to the leadership of the United States to plot the political transition that will result in him leaving power.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is somebody whose failed leadership has caused a lot of problems not just for the rest of the world, but for himself as well.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to North Korea, that is a country that is enduring extreme poverty and extreme isolation.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, the rest of the international community stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States as we seek to resolve that situation.\xc2\xa0 I think that is an indication of successful presidential leadership even if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t at this point accomplished our ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you understand how some critics would argue that because this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a very robust engagement by the United States, that actors like Putin in Crimea, for example, and Assad and even Un are kind of running wild right now in absence of American strong leadership?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can \xe2\x80\x9crun wild\xe2\x80\x9d if you are more isolated than any other world leader.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are concerned about the destabilizing impact that North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s provocative actions are having on Northeastern Asia.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are concerned about the impact that that could have on the north -- on the national security situation of our close allies like Japan and South Korea.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that as the international community continues to work together to confront the situation, the national security interests of the United States are enhanced and our interests are advanced.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Iran earlier, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of sleight of hand there from the Iranians\xe2\x80\x99 perspective -- meaning they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to, on the one hand, work with the international community to have sanctions relief, but on the other hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s been widely reported that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with the North Koreans, perhaps even using them as a proxy to continue development of their own nuclear ambition.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House understand that view?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the veracity of those claims. Obviously both Iran and North Korea have been subjected to significant sanctions and significant international efforts to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, and that certainly has had an impact on the ability of both those countries to get access to materials and technology that could advance their efforts.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, are you saying that the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Tehran and Pyongyang are working together in concert in nuclear development, like -- even in this particular test?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm the veracity of those kinds of claims.\xc2\xa0 But I can suggest that there -- because of the leadership of the United States and other international institutions like the United Nations, there are significant barriers to those two countries doing exactly what you described.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Trey Gowdy said his committee has dates on the calendar to interview Mr. Rhodes and Ms. Rice.\xc2\xa0 At this point, they have not said that they would refuse, although Gowdy is willing to issue a subpoena.\xc2\xa0 And I guess the obvious would be, would Rice and Rhodes be willing to testify without the necessity of a subpoena?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that announcement from Mr. Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s committee, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at it and get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Byron.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask specifically about the President\xe2\x80\x99s options regarding North Korea?\xc2\xa0 The White House statement overnight said the U.S. would respond appropriately.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what that might mean?\xc2\xa0 Will he use provisions in the executive order that he signed after the Sony hack?\xc2\xa0 Will they be relisted as a state sponsor of terror?\xc2\xa0 What are some of the actions that the United States might take?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Byron, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to sort of list the potential actions that the United States and the international community could take in light of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear test.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly will consider a wide range of options to appropriately respond to this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 That was the subject of the discussion at the United Nations just this morning at an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting that the United States and Japan convened.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is something that we take quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific potential responses to itemize for you at this point.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this test show that for all the time the President has invested in Asia, what you\xe2\x80\x99ve termed the \xe2\x80\x9cpivot,\xe2\x80\x9d that it\xe2\x80\x99s failed to result in any sort of changes to North Korean behavior?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the kinds of changes in North Korean behavior that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 But I do think the President\xe2\x80\x99s investment in Asia is at least in part responsible for the unanimity of opinion we see among the Chinese, the South Koreans and the Japanese for confronting this situation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s notable that those three countries that don\xe2\x80\x99t often agree on much do all agree on the appropriate approach here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     It\xe2\x80\x99s also notable that the Chinese government has confirmed that they agree with the United States that the international community will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-weapons state. That is a result of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to continue to strengthen our ability to work with China on those areas where we can find common ground -- and North Korea is certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 And our efforts to resolve this situation will certainly be enhanced based on that common ground.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related to China, does the U.S. need to put more pressure on China to get involved in this situation?\xc2\xa0 Has the President prioritized economic issues in climate change in its relationship with China rather than dealing with the North Korean security situation?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, whenever the President sits down to talk to his counterpart -- and whether that was President Hu or President Xi over the last year, year and a half -- the agenda has been filled with lots of items.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about these two large countries and two large economies, you\xe2\x80\x99d expect that there would be a lot on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 And surely, when they do sit down to talk, they spend a lot of time talking about the economy and climate change and cybersecurity, maritime security and other high-priority issues -- that includes human rights -- that the North Korean issue is one that also comes up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     The Chinese are, understandably, concerned about provocative actions from the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 Again, instability in Northeast Asia, and on the Korean Peninsula, in particular, has significant consequences for China because they share a border with North Korea.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re rightly concerned and invested in their own right in trying to resolve the situation.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to find some common ground around an approach that will apply significant pressure to the North Koreans.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, as you point out and as I\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged here on a number of occasions, our ultimate goal here has not yet been achieved.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just follow up on Byron\xe2\x80\x99s question about the statement from the NSC overnight that there would be an appropriate response to any and all provocations.\xc2\xa0 Even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to enumerate what some of the things might be that are on that list, is this something that requires a response beyond what\xe2\x80\x99s already out there?\xc2\xa0 In other words, not just doubling down on more of the same.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult question to answer.\xc2\xa0 Presumably, if there\xe2\x80\x99s something like that out there, it\'s not something we would want to announce in advance.\xc2\xa0 If there were a new type of financial sanction that we\'re prepared to implement, for example, that\'s something that we would want to do without announcing it in advance.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me just say that I\'m confident that the President and his national security team will think broadly about the most appropriate way to respond, but also we\'re going to want to do so in a way that preserves the kind of unanimity of opinion across the world that we see right now.\xc2\xa0 That strengthens our hand in dealing with the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that we\'re preserving international unity even as we consider a range of steps that we believe will advance the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you said this is an initial assessment -- how confident is the White House this was not a hydrogen bomb?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t give you a detailed assessment at this point because it\'s only an initial analysis that has been completed.\xc2\xa0 This, after all, is an event that just occurred 18 hours or so ago.\xc2\xa0 But that initial analysis is not consistent with the claims that were made by the North Koreans that they had successfully conducted a test of a hydrogen bomb.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have determined that they conducted a nuclear test last night.\xc2\xa0 That\'s based largely on seismic data but also based on information that was collected by our allies and partners in the region.\xc2\xa0 We are certainly interested in examining and analyzing more evidence and more data to see if we can get greater clarity about what exactly did happen.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is anybody else going to be in the meeting with Secretary Kerry and the President?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 When they meet today?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, but we\'ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask you quickly about the announcement yesterday on the executive orders.\xc2\xa0 Even some critics who, frankly, support broader regulation of guns have said that part of the problem is that, one, there\xe2\x80\x99s no clear indication of how many more background checks will be conducted, and that the ATF is not, frankly, set up to deal with sort of more work, that 200 agents who are being proposed are barely enough to keep up with attrition, that it\'s already an agency that\xe2\x80\x99s understaffed.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been behind many other agencies and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a permanent director.\xc2\xa0 So even if you work from the assumption that what the White House hopes will happen will happen, which many people are skeptical of, are the ATF and the FBI prepared to deal with it?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer that in two ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, one of the proposals that the President has put forward is to invest in actually making the background check system more efficient and more effective.\xc2\xa0 Right now, the background check system is run on technology that is a decade or two old.\xc2\xa0 Obviously tremendous advances have been made in information technology that could --</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long would it take to bring it up to speed?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve got some really good people working on it, and our record of making these kinds of improvements is a good one.\xc2\xa0 So obviously it will be a priority and something that they are working on.\xc2\xa0 So by deploying some better technology we can certainly address some of the concerns that you have just raised.\xc2\xa0 By making the system more efficient we can more quickly get results and get more reliable results that can be used to make sure we\'re keeping guns out of the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, we\'ve also asked for more resources to hire additional agents to conduct additional investigations.\xc2\xa0 And again, the refrain from Republicans is that we don\'t need any new laws, we just need to better enforce the laws that we have.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t think of a better way of doing that than clarifying the law by issuing some legal guidance and making clear exactly what the law is, which is what the President did in the course of the executive actions, and backing that up by hiring more agents to go out and actually enforce that law.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s why it is hard to take seriously the kind of criticism and objection that has been raised by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not serious.\xc2\xa0 But it is rooted in politics.\xc2\xa0 And the President has talked at some length about how this issue, I think, as well as any other, is a good illustration of the political dysfunction and the broken politics on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just say one other thing about the numbers.\xc2\xa0 One reason that it is hard for us to point to a lot of data on this issue is that Republicans supported legislation that actually prevents the collection of data.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how outrageous this whole situation is.\xc2\xa0 Republicans like to say, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no data out there to support these claims, and yet it\'s Republicans themselves that have specifically prohibited the CDC and others from actually collecting that data in the first place and allowing analysis to be done that would target it.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, it certainly raises some questions about those claims.\xc2\xa0 But there is a lot of anecdotal evidence.\xc2\xa0 And there is one website that has been viewed that is advertising the sale of about 80,000 guns.\xc2\xa0 And the question is whether or not that website and all those transactions would be subject to a background check.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re seeking to clarify and that\'s what we\'re seeking to enforce.\xc2\xa0 And if there are people who are out there selling guns for profit and right now hiding behind the hobbyist exemption that currently exists, they should know that they\xe2\x80\x99re running a significant risk, that the penalty associated with violating the statute that has now been clarified is significant.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re found in violation of the statute, you can be punished with up to five years in jail and subject to a fine of up to $250,000.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is something that is quite serious. And I think that understanding the stakes and understanding that there are serious consequences for not complying with the law I think will prompt a substantial number of people to take the necessary steps to make sure that they are complying with the law, and as a result, making sure that their customers are going through background checks.\xc2\xa0 And if we can make that background check system more effective, we can actually do a better job of keeping guns out of the wrong hands, which is a common-sense goal and certainly one that the President is determined to make progress on.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if this is the priority that you and the President have indicated it is, what level of priority is it to get a permanent director into the ATF?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve talked before, and I guess we\'ll talk again, about the sordid record that Republicans have of confirming highly qualified Obama administration nominees to important positions.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there certainly -- if there were, I would not have any confidence that that individual would be treated fairly by Republicans in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of nominees right now who are not appointed to controversial jobs like leading the ATF that are being treated very poorly by Republicans, some of which have significant national security consequences for the United States.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a nomination?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements to make at this point.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t rule it out, necessarily.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just one quick question.\xc2\xa0 The President has apparently appointed a new CENTCOM commander -- the former Special Operations boss, Joe Votel.\xc2\xa0 To what extent does this signal a different or a new approach in the military campaigns in places like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan that you now have a Special Operations guy in charge of the military operations in all of those areas?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Gardiner, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some reports speculating about potential personnel announcements that may be made, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, in general, that we\xe2\x80\x99re talked about the important role that our Special Operations personnel are playing in our ongoing efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the President did announce the deployment of some Special Operations personnel into Syria to be a force multiplier with some opposition forces that are working with our coalition to fight ISIL and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen the establishment of these expeditionary task forces that could carry out raids and pursue other priorities that are identified by the administration, and obviously there are Special Operations personnel that are involved in that effort as well.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So any personnel announcements notwithstanding, the observation that you have made about the important role that our Special Operations personnel are playing in the counter-ISIL campaign is certainly warranted.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on North Korea, what are the agencies that make the determination about what type of nuclear device was detonated?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The intelligence community obviously draws on significant scientific resources and their relationships in the region to offer an assessment like this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly when they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more robust assessment that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to share, but the intelligence community will obviously be working closely on this, based on the scientific expertise that they can bring to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Congress, when you talk about disagreeing without being disagreeable, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it being disagreeable when you accuse Congress of political dysfunction?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, even Speaker Ryan himself acknowledged that Congress not passing legislation to close the background check loophole -- he described that in his statement as a legislative failure.\xc2\xa0 I think a legislative --</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He meant by you.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative failure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve in the Congress, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve it the legislature.\xc2\xa0 I think he was describing a legislative failure on the part of Congress.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a legislative failure that he obviously sought to advance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     But, look, I think acknowledging that there is political dysfunction on Capitol Hill I think is obvious and is an opinion that is shared by Democrats and Republicans who work on Capitol Hill themselves.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m also confident that that is an opinion that is shared by the up to 80 percent of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, who say that they have an unfavorable view of Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend it to be disagreeable; I intend it to be a statement of fact.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you and President Obama have both criticized Congress for defying popular opinion on background checks.\xc2\xa0 And yet, at the start of the briefing you trumpeted how the President defied popular opinion on the auto bailout.\xc2\xa0 Is there a disconnect there?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think when I cite polls talking about the strong support for the common-sense steps that the President announced yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that Congress should take these steps because they\xe2\x80\x99re popular; I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting that Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t use as an excuse to oppose those steps the suggestion that somehow what the President is doing is controversial or something that a whole bunch of Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t support.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make by citing the poll there.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not having it both ways?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure my critics won\xe2\x80\x99t agree.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Gregory, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense is ordering a review of medals, decorations and awards granted to soldiers -- servicemen and women since 9/11, with the idea of reexamining whether some of those servicemen and women should be awarded the Medal of Honor.\xc2\xa0 The feeling is that perhaps in the warzone of Iraq and Afghanistan, too many valorous deeds have been overlooked and that too many of those medals, where they have been awarded, have been awarded posthumously.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share those concerns and would he like to see more Medal of Honor ceremonies in the East Room?</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that specific announcement by the Secretary of Defense, so I want to be cautious about what I do say, based on what you have asked, primarily because the process for awarding a Medal of Honor goes through a rigorous chain-of-command process that the President eventually signed off on.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say something from here that could influence that process at a stage before it reaches the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xc2\xa0 But let me just say, in general, that the President has, on a number of occasions over the last seven years, had the great honor of presenting that medal to servicemembers who have undertaken significant acts of bravery while serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the President himself has spoken rather movingly about the contributions of the 9/11 generation of military personnel to our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that that generation of Americans has made a substantial commitment to our national security and, in some cases, paid a substantial sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 Some of the medals that the President has awarded have been posthumous.\xc2\xa0 Some of the medals that the President awarded to a servicemember, even those who are living when they receive the medal, had families back home who endured their loved one being in a warzone for months or years at a time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that this generation of Americans has borne a significant burden in protecting our country since 9/11.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     And we certainly have -- the President himself has raised concerns about the wisdom of the decision that was made by the previous administration to go to war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But that does not in any way diminish the President\xe2\x80\x99s deep appreciation, respect, and even honor for those who have served our country in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I will see if there is more that we can get you, Gregory, from here on that particular review process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02:39 P.M.
