GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How\'s everyone today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he ready?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope he is.\xc2\xa0 No, I think he will be.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s been doing some practicing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s just been throwing a little bit with -- I think he threw some last night some with Reggie.\xc2\xa0 He recalls fondly that the last time he did this was, as you all may know, in 2005 at the American League Championship Series.\xc2\xa0 And it was the game in which -- we were all there watching and basically the White Sox were about to go down 2-0 in the series.\xc2\xa0 Then they had a crazy pitch, a guy got to first base, the inning kept going, and they didn\'t lose again in the playoffs.\xc2\xa0 They won the next four in the Championship Series and won four straight in the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) White Sox --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say there\'s a very small scintilla of the game in which he\'s proud to have been a part of, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) here for community colleges or baseball?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is a representative of the Philadelphia Phillies today and excited to go to the game.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have -- hopefully I can bring our special guest back on the next leg of the trip, just so you -- some of you may be aware that Willie Mays will be flying with us from Detroit to St. Louis.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else besides Willie Mays?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s -- no more baseball folks, no.\xc2\xa0 But obviously somebody who\'s -- you know, charitably, probably he and Babe Ruth are the greatest baseball players ever to play.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President met him before?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe they have met before doing fundraising stuff out on the West Coast.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, no more baseball.\xc2\xa0 Goldman Sachs reported earnings today, an all-time high for them, and then set aside over $11 billion in compensation just for half the year.\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen that?\xc2\xa0 Does he think it\'s appropriate for a company that\'s received $10 billion in government funding to set aside that kind of money for compensations?\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on the profit --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that -- I don\'t know if the President has seen any of the information.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m generally hesitant -- as I think the Treasury Department is -- to comment on individual earnings reports.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not -- you\'re not at all -- you\'re eyebrow wasn\'t raised to see Goldman Sachs earning so much money from a year ago?\xc2\xa0 This is a company that got the AIG -- they got paid back by AIG, which was federal government money.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m just -- I\'m hesitant to comment on individual earnings reports.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s appropriate for a company that\'s received federal funds to set aside $300,000 per employee for compensation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen information directly on the compensation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s what it is.\xc2\xa0 Do you think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the briefing on your part and I\'ll seek to try to find that information out myself.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the fact that the President\'s father-in-law is buried in Burr Oak?\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a reaction to what happened there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have no comment at all?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you describe what the President\'s mood is coming to Michigan, given the unemployment numbers here and the, sort of, mood?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously this is -- I think as he said this afternoon in the Oval -- or this morning in the Oval Office, obviously you\'ve got a state that the unemployment rate is the greatest in the nation and obviously is a state that has dealt with economic transformation, the loss of auto and manufacturing jobs well before the recession hit.\xc2\xa0 So obviously this is probably as hard-hit an area as there is in the entire country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think one of the things that is important about today\'s stop is one aspect of putting people back to work and laying that long-term foundation for economic growth is increasing the number of people that we have in this country that get a post-high school education, that get the job training and placement help necessary for the jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the program -- the new initiative that the President will highlight today that he talked originally about in the joint session of Congress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But obviously, look, there are lots and lots of people that are hurting all throughout Michigan and the Midwest as a result, again, of not just the downturn in the economy but things that they\'ve struggled with economically for quite some time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you guys are moving money fast enough into Michigan -- stimulus money fast enough into Michigan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The recovery plan is ahead of the pace that was originally set --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, in Michigan and throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 I think Michigan is one of the -- one of the top 10 state recipients for money.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, I think you can talk to people in Michigan that have watched recovery money go in.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt that there are fewer teachers that have been laid off because of money that has come in to help education funding.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt that people have been hired because road construction projects are starting here and in the Detroit area and throughout the state that have put people back to work.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, we\'ve got a lot of work to do in the Midwest and in Michigan and throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 Money has moved quickly.\xc2\xa0 It has moved ahead of pace.\xc2\xa0 And it has prevented an even sharper economic downturn from occurring.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how many jobs have been created so far in Michigan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an exact Michigan figure, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he watch any of the Sotomayor questioning today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did he?\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t believe he has watched any of the hearings thus far.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to her at all?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not since Sunday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been briefed at all about Senator Sessions\' line of questioning?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We talked briefly in the -- we\'re going to be surfing here in a minute -- in the senior staff meeting just generally about the fact that questioning had started.\xc2\xa0 And I think her answers, telling senators again that she\'s going to follow the law as she has for 17 years as a judge and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is she getting a fair shake from the Republicans?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think so.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, everyone understands that this is the drill.\xc2\xa0 I think that if Republicans listen to the answers that she gives and look at her 17-year record, they\'ll figure out that this is a nominee that has a distinguished record, lots of experience, and somebody that\'s going to follow the law.\xc2\xa0 So I think she\'ll -- I think she\'s doing really well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the Detroit area.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  2:40 P.M. EDT<br/>  \xc2\xa0</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
