EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to New York for what promises to be an exciting Friday in the city that never sleeps.</p>\n<p>I actually do have a couple of announcements at the top here before we get going.\xc2\xa0 Let me start with -- earlier today at the White House, the President held a conference call with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray, and House Budget Ranking Member Chris Van Hollen on budget matters in advance of the first meeting of the budget conference that\xe2\x80\x99s set for next week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President thanked the leaders for their efforts to find a solution to our budget challenges, and reiterated a shared principle that we should focus, first and foremost, on how we can grow our economy and create new jobs with good wages for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 These are the policies that leaders in Washington, D.C. should support so that we can actually make progress when it comes to our economy and not undermine our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 So that call took place at the White House earlier today.</p>\n<p>The second thing I wanted to note for you:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Dr. Janet Yellen\xe2\x80\x99s paperwork for her nomination as Chair of the Federal Reserve was submitted to Capitol Hill, and next week she will begin visiting with individual senators on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 As the President said when he nominated Dr. Yellen earlier this month, she is exceptionally well qualified for this role.\xc2\xa0 She served in leadership positions at the Fed for more than a decade, and as Vice Chair for the last three years she has been exemplary and a driving force in policies to help boost our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to the Senate confirming her swiftly and in bipartisan fashion for this very important role.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a third thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then finally, one thing -- I have a full week ahead, but there\xe2\x80\x99s one aspect of the week ahead that I wanted to note for you in advance.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday afternoon, October 31st, the President will host and deliver remarks at the SelectUSA Investment Summit in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The summit will be attended by 1,200 people from 58 different countries across the world.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that in June of 2011, the President launched the SelectUSA Initiative to support private sector job creation and encourage new business investment in the United States.\xc2\xa0 In February of 2012, in Milwaukee, the President announced the first SelectUSA Investment Summit.\xc2\xa0 At the time, the President said we\xe2\x80\x99ll be bringing companies from around the world together with governors and mayors and other leaders in the U.S. to discuss the benefits of investing and creating more jobs right here in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will discuss the importance of taking measures to grow the economy, encouraging the businesses -- pardon me, encouraging the businesses and investors from around the world in attendance to bring new investment and jobs to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 On the heels of the self-inflicted crisis in Washington, D.C., it\xe2\x80\x99s time for folks to come together and focus on doing everything we can to spur growth and create new, high-quality jobs.\xc2\xa0 The summit will provide an opportunity to do just that.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday afternoon next week, on October 31st.</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the rest of the week ahead when we\xe2\x80\x99re done with your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you tell us a little bit more about the call today?\xc2\xa0 How long did it last?\xc2\xa0 And did the President and the leaders discuss the size and the scope of the budget deal that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see in the next few weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to provide to you.\xc2\xa0 It was a -- I know it was scheduled to last for about 45 minutes or so.\xc2\xa0 And it was an opportunity for all the Democratic leaders to confer about the priorities they\xe2\x80\x99re going to pursue in the context of the budget conference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about this a little bit more today at the event in Brooklyn, where the President will make the case that the budget conference proceedings should be a venue for making some important decisions in bipartisan fashion about what we can do to invest in the kinds of policies that actually support middle-class families.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk on the other side of the aisle about the importance of making -- of cutting government spending.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is we can\xe2\x80\x99t cut our way to prosperity, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated, both in the policies that he\xe2\x80\x99s pursued and in the budget proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to choose between austerity or fiscal responsibility and growth.\xc2\xa0 We can do both.\xc2\xa0 We can both pursue growth in a fiscally responsible fashion.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal is a good example of that.\xc2\xa0 It makes important investments in research and development and infrastructure and education, but actually does more to reduce the deficit than the sequester does.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re on a good path of reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re reducing the deficit at a rate as fast as the deficit has been declining -- as fast as it has at any time in the last 50 years.\xc2\xa0 We can stay on that path of reducing the deficit while at the same time protecting investments that we know are critical to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on bipartisanship, does he plan to make a similar call to the Republican leaders in this process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings at this point to read out to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, about the budget -- Republicans like Paul Ryan, even Harry Reid, have expressed doubts that any kind of a grand bargain budget deal would be reached.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be satisfied with sort of a more small- or lower-expectations kind of budget deal?\xc2\xa0 Or does he still want to go for a grand bargain?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what both sides are pursuing -- and the President is pleased to see this -- both sides are pursuing what Speaker Boehner had often referred to as regular order -- that this is the regular part of the budget process that\xe2\x80\x99s moving through the Congress if the House passes a budget, the Senate passes a budget, and both sides work in bipartisan fashion to try to reconcile the differences in those budgets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the President has put forward his own proposal for how he thinks they should do that.\xc2\xa0 In the budget proposal that the President put forward earlier this year, he laid out some specific ideas about investments we could make in infrastructure and research and development, and other things -- and education -- other things that are critical to the long-term economic success of the country, and specifically will be critical to the success of middle-class families in this country.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that ensuring the economic success of middle-class families will ensure the success of a broader economy.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>So the President has his own ideas about how he can pursue this.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, the President\xe2\x80\x99s own proposal would allow us to protect those investments while at the same time actually doing more to reduce the deficit than the sequester did.\xc2\xa0 So we could repeal the sequester, protect our investments in the kinds of things that will ensure the success of middle-class families in this country, while continuing along the path of reducing our deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward our own ideas for how we should do this, but ultimately Congress, and the members who are part of this budget conference, will have to make that decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see a path to replacing the sequester without raising revenues in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to negotiate that from here.\xc2\xa0 There will be a very robust discussion of these kinds of questions in the context of that conference committee.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been very specific about what he thinks would be the best way for us to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask one international question.\xc2\xa0 Allies in Europe remain very upset about allegations of phone hacking.\xc2\xa0 The Europeans, I believe the French and the Germans, are now talking about possibly having some kind of a conference about respecting the security of phone conversations.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that level of concern?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have acknowledged, pretty forthrightly, that some of the reports and revelations has prompted some tension in our relationships with some of our closest allies.\xc2\xa0 We have worked through our regular diplomatic channels to address some of those tensions.\xc2\xa0 These are strong relationships; you mentioned a couple of them -- France and Germany.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are nations with whom the United States has a very close relationship.\xc2\xa0 We cooperate with them on a wide range of issues -- everything from the economy to climate change, human rights issues, and of course some important security counterterrorism issues as well.\xc2\xa0 So the nature of those relationships is both deep and broad.</p>\n<p>The programs that are referred to in some of this reporting are national security programs.\xc2\xa0 And these are programs that, speaking broadly, have played a critical role in protecting citizens of the United States from those who wish to do us harm.\xc2\xa0 These programs have also played an instrumental role in our coordination with our allies and protecting the interest of our allies, too.\xc2\xa0 So these are important programs.</p>\n<p>The President has, however, ordered an internal review to ensure that the intelligence that\'s collected is not just all the intelligence that we are able to collect, but rather intelligence that should be collected and intelligence that we need to collect to safeguard the United States and our interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at these programs to ensure that it meets that standard that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to confer with our allies through our regular diplomatic channels to address the concerns that they\xe2\x80\x99ve raised.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, what we need to do is we need to balance the important role that these programs play in protecting our national security and protecting the security of our allies with the legitimate privacy concerns that others have raised.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, any other policy changes or legislative recommendations to go along with that question in terms of the concerns of our EU allies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to announce at this point.\xc2\xa0 But there are a number of reviews that are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an internal review that the President has ordered that members of his national security team are working on.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a separate review of outside experts that has a particular focus of communications technology that\xe2\x80\x99s underway.\xc2\xa0 There also are some issues that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Liberties Oversight Board is reviewing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a number of reviews underway that will examine exactly these questions and consider some of the policy changes that you\xe2\x80\x99re recommending -- or at least hinting might be among their recommendations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- anything legislative?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were talking about the outside review.\xc2\xa0 Is that new -- this looking at communications technology?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, this is something that the President announced earlier this summer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how would listening to the conversations of leaders of friendly nations, like Brazil or France, help protect the security of Americans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about any specific programs or operations -- suffice it to say that the United States, like virtually every other country around the world, is involved in collecting intelligence.\xc2\xa0 And what the President believes is important is that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just collect all the intelligence that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to collect; rather, we should be focused on the intelligence that we should collect and the intelligence that we need to collect to safeguard the United States and our allies.</p>\n<p>And part of the review -- part of these reviews, I should say, is examining that question.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have any new ground to break at this point.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the ACA -- 10 Senate Democrats sent a letter to the President today asking him to -- sorry, sent a letter to Kathleen Sebelius today asking her to delay the enrollment period for at least two more months.\xc2\xa0 Does that cause the White House to rethink the timetable?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is that, since October 1st, people have been signing up and enrolling in health care.\xc2\xa0 And since October 1st, we have been working rather aggressively to address some of the challenges that were exposed -- some of the challenges with the website that were exposed by the high traffic and high volume of interest that we saw in the days immediately after October 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You heard from CMS earlier today that they are announcing some structural changes to try to address some of those problems.\xc2\xa0 They are putting in place essentially a general contractor to manage the process of addressing these challenges and putting in place some of the performance and functional fixes that need to be added.\xc2\xa0 And you also heard CMS lay out a timeline for when that would be accomplished -- essentially, they are in a position where they expect that the website will be working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of November.</p>\n<p>Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the flaws and the problems with the website that we saw in the aftermath of October 1st is going to have an impact on the enrollment numbers.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you all wrote stories, or at least read stories, about people who tried to go to the website to enroll in health insurance but weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to because the website didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 So this is going to have an impact on the number of people who enroll early on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s something important for you to remember about people enrolling early on.\xc2\xa0 If you take a look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, when they began their open enrollment period, a grand total of 123 people signed up during the first month of open enrollment in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the pace of enrollments increased dramatically as it got closer to the deadline.\xc2\xa0 We expect to see a similar trend in those enrollment figures related to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>So what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is to improve the website.\xc2\xa0 And, as Mr. Zients noted during his conference call today, they\xe2\x80\x99re making regular progress in improving and upgrading the website, and they\xe2\x80\x99re in fact encouraging people to go onto the website and sign up for an account, and begin the process of submitting an application and applying for health insurance.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re making some progress, and this is -- the one last thing I want to say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re less than four weeks into a six-month enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 So there are benefits to having a pretty broad window here, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we are resting on our laurels at all; in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite the opposite.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Zients talked about a war room that\xe2\x80\x99s working around the clock to try to address these problems and making regular upgrades to the website so that it performs more closely to the level that we expect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, why does the President and why should the American people have confidence that CMS can get this right after they\xe2\x80\x99ve already gotten it wrong once?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a couple of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is we have had a tech surge.\xc2\xa0 We have had some new eyes take a look at this.\xc2\xa0 And based on the initial assessment that Mr. Zients has led with some other outside experts and some other technology experts from the government, they have assessed that there are a lot of problems to fix but that we can get to a place where the website is functioning pretty smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of next month.\xc2\xa0 So that is based on people who have taken a careful look at this.</p>\n<p>This is also based on the assessment of people who have been a part of building the website in the first place.\xc2\xa0 So they have a good sense of where the problems lie and what\xe2\x80\x99s required to fix it.\xc2\xa0 And so I have no doubt that some of the management changes that Jeff announced earlier today will have an impact on that process.\xc2\xa0 But, overall, the American people expect a health care -- an Affordable Care Act implementation that works and a healthcare.gov that works.\xc2\xa0 And the President and his team are committed to living up to those expectations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How involved is the President going to be?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously now he is even more on the line for this -- his reputation -- and this has been such a huge, for lack of a better word, disaster for you guys.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be much more personally involved or is he kind of letting Zients take over this whole thing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Zients is responsible for -- was responsible for taking a look at this -- conducting this initial assessment and making sure that the tech surge plays a tangible role in correcting some of the problems that they have seen.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve seen problems related to the performance of the website, how reliable is it.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty unreliable.\xc2\xa0 There have been some problems related to the speed with which it\xe2\x80\x99s processing information that\xe2\x80\x99s submitted, so they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to optimize the speed.\xc2\xa0 There have also been some clear functional problems, where there are some applications that just aren\xe2\x80\x99t working.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fix those as well.</p>\n<p>So Jeff and his team are responsible for sort of the day-to-day monitoring of all this.\xc2\xa0 But you would not be wrong to assume that the President is a very interested observer in this process, is being regularly updated on it, and is holding that team accountable for results.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has Jeff briefed the President personally or is somebody else?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know how that process is working.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, does the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re able to now put a timetable on this mean that the problems have more or less been diagnosed and now we\xe2\x80\x99re in the fixing them stage?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility, when he took on this task a week or so ago, was to provide an initial assessment of what the challenges were.\xc2\xa0 And as he alluded to on the conference call today, that assessment has been largely completed.\xc2\xa0 So they have -- as I pointed out earlier, they\xe2\x80\x99ve walked through some of the problems that were plaguing the site\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform at the level that the American people and this administration expect, and that there is a -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ve essentially created a punch list, a to-do list, if you will, of all the fixes that need to be implemented, and they\xe2\x80\x99re walking down that list one by one and knocking those things out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that by the end of next month there will be a website in place that operates smoothly for the vast majority of people who are trying to use it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President will attend the installation of FBI Director James Comey at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will travel to the United States Capitol and attend a memorial service for former Speaker of the House Tom Foley.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will travel to Boston, Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in some political events while he is there\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday, as I mentioned at the top, the President will host and deliver remarks at the SelectUSA Investment Summit.</p>\n<p>And then, on Friday, the President will host Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The visit will highlight the importance of the U.S.-Iraq relationship under the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing with Prime Minister al-Maliki efforts to enhance cooperation in the fields covered under the SFA and to coordinating on a wide range of regional issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is the President for in the World Series, Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him about that, but since his beloved Chicago White Sox are not in it, I think he is rooting for a seven-game series.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are you and Jay handling this, by the way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The World Series?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jay is a much more active observer of this process.\xc2\xa0 My beloved Kansas City Royals are not participating this year, but Jay is obviously an avid fan of the Red Sox and is actively encouraging others to take up their cause.\xc2\xa0 It was a -- the Red Sox did not win last night but I stayed up late watching it.\xc2\xa0 It was a really exciting game.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing -- this is the President\xe2\x80\x99s first trip to Brooklyn after 33 trips to New York, per our friend, Mark Knoller.\xc2\xa0 Is the President finally discovering Brooklyn?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about this in his remarks.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll tune in to find out.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the ground in a little bit.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:18 P.M.
