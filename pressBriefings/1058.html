EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I apologize.\xc2\xa0 I know we gave the two-minute a little more than two minutes ago.\xc2\xa0 Something came up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nothing newsworthy, I promise you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lunch?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I had that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, maybe it came up -- (laughter) -- thinking about coming out here, you know. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anybody else, any other one-liners? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here today.\xc2\xa0 Before we get to questions, I just wanted to say that we\'re very pleased that today Congress is taking up three important trade agreements that will help strengthen our economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President has strongly supported these trade agreements and, in fact, worked very hard to get the best possible trade agreement with South Korea, and we\'re glad to see that Congress is taking them up and hopefully will approve them tonight or today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would say that that\'s an indication of the kind of cooperation that this President has had and will continue to have with Republicans on areas where they agree.\xc2\xa0 Patent reform is another example of the kind of cooperation between Republicans in the Congress, as well as Democrats, and this President.\xc2\xa0 That is a piece of legislation that Republicans said was very important. The President agreed; he has signed it into law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having noted that, I would say that instead of continuing to focus on creating jobs and getting the American people back to work, tomorrow the House of Representatives is scheduled to turn its attention to a divisive, politically motivated piece of legislation that unnecessarily restricts the private insurance choices that women and their families have today, and it is legislation that will not create a single job, when job creation and economic growth is the American people\'s highest priority. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House has also been focused on measures that would either eliminate or severely constrict our ability to keep our air and water clean.\xc2\xa0 Again, these kinds of measures have no job-creating potential, certainly not in the near term, setting aside their merits.\xc2\xa0 The priorities that the American people have right now are the economy and jobs, and that\'s the priorities that this President is focused on, as you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is -- going back to that piece of legislation that I mentioned before that comes up tomorrow in the House -- the President\'s senior advisors will recommend that he veto this legislation if it is presented to him.\xc2\xa0 It\'s time for Congress to meet its responsibility, put these kinds of divisive measures aside and take action on jobs right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, Ben Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On the failed plot to murder the Saudi ambassador, does the White House consider that an act of war?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We consider it what it was, which is an attempted terrorist act to assassinate the Saudi ambassador here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important to call things what they are.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is that the United States disrupted a conspiracy to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in a plot that was directed by elements of the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 And the disruption of this plot represents a significant achievement by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous escalation of the Iranian government\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding use of violence.\xc2\xa0 And we consider an effort to assassinate a diplomat in the United States to be a flagrant violation of international law.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we are committed to holding the Iranians accountable. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have charged two individuals because of their involvement in this serious plot, and have sanctioned several others.\xc2\xa0 We have imposed additional sanctions today on Mahan Air, which provides transportation, funds, transfers and personnel travel services to the IRGC, the Republican Guard.\xc2\xa0 We are actively engaged in a very concerted diplomatic outreach to many capitals, to the U.N. in New York as well, to explain what happened so we can try to preempt any efforts by Iran to be successful in their efforts to try to deflect responsibility, and so we can enlist more countries in working together against this escalation by Iran.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you put in some perspective from the White House view how massive the response could have been by the United States had this plot succeeded?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any doubt that there -- is there little doubt there would have been some sort of military response to this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s speculating on what might have happened had we not succeeded in disrupting this plot because of the excellent work and coordination between our law enforcement agencies and our intelligence agencies. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this arena, we take no options off the table.\xc2\xa0 But in dealing with Iran, we are clearly focused on working through economic measures, sanctions, as well as diplomatic measures to isolate Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, we think, substantial success doing that.\xc2\xa0 For the first time in a long time, the Iranian economy is not growing, and we think that is a result both of poor decision-making by the Iranian leadership, but also by the impact of the substantial sanctions that we and others have placed on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this President has been very focused on holding up Iranian behavior so that it is clearly seen by other nations around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that enables us to work cooperatively with our international partners to isolate and put pressure on Iran in a way that has never really been achieved before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that, one more quickly on that last point.\xc2\xa0 What would be a satisfactory response from the world community?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with -- in a bilateral way with other countries and other capitals to discuss what happened, the seriousness of this plot, and the involvement of the Iranian government in it, and working both bilaterally with other countries as well as internationally through the U.N. and other institutions, to continue to isolate Iran through a variety of means. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick one on the jobs front.\xc2\xa0 We know the White House is working with the Senate on what happens now, when the pieces might come forward.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell the American public that might be looking for action on some of these pieces when they can expect action?\xc2\xa0 What might come first?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the plan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will leave it to the leaders of the Senate -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- to fill in the details of what we hope will be a series of votes in the Senate on the component parts of the American Jobs Act -- because, as you point out, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of interest out there in this jobs act being passed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last night, let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear what we saw happen -- a majority of the United States Senate voted in favor of legislation that is supported by the majority of the American people, that is paid for in a way that has the support of the majority of the American people, and it was blocked by Republicans who -- none of them, not a single Republican senator voted for it, which would suggest perhaps that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an economic or jobs problem in the states that those senators represent.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having been through that vote last night, we now expect the Senate to move forward and hold votes on individual component pieces on it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, we want Congress to pass it in full.\xc2\xa0 If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, the President wants Congress to take action on the individual components of it.\xc2\xa0 And if measures come to him that have passed and are paid for and they\xe2\x80\x99re paid for in a way that meets his principles, then he will sign them into law and he will say, "Where is the rest?" \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because one of the reasons -- when the President, the Vice President, and their team, the team here, crafted this proposal there were two priorities:\xc2\xa0 One, you had to have measures in it that would have direct and immediate impact on the economy, on growth and on job creation.\xc2\xa0 And, two, they wanted it to have measures -- they wanted it to be filled with measures that had traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, or the kinds of measures that had -- which I think goes to the whole argument about whether or not this was a political exercise or a legislative exercise. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a legislative exercise, and it is a legislative exercise.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it has within it things that Republicans have traditionally supported.\xc2\xa0 And we hope, moving forward, perhaps by breaking it up, Republicans will support it and hear the call from their constituents that they want Washington to take action on their number-one priority. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to move it around.\xc2\xa0 I want to go up and back -- anybody in the back there?\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on that, will the President be proposing which legislation comes forward, which piece, or is that entirely in Reid\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\xc2\xa0 Which one would start first if they start --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously consult with and coordinate with Senate leadership as well as the House leadership regularly and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to make those decisions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss that with him, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to him to make any announcements that he might have in terms of how to proceed and on what schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come forward -- yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, based on what U.S. officials know about the Iran plot, how high up does the knowledge and involvement go?\xc2\xa0 Does it go all the way up to Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Clearly, the plotting of this attempted assassination happened at senior levels of the Quds Force.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get any more specific.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s significant in and of itself that we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that senior levels of the Quds Force were engaged in the plotting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, how broad are we thinking of Iran policies going on right now?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned -- you called this a \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous escalation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s of a different order than the types of issues that you were looking at when these sanctions were developed.\xc2\xa0 Is this a time for a major rethinking of the policy toward Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are obviously responding to this with some of the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken and some of the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making working with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 And we will hold Iran accountable for its actions here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would simply step back to look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall policy.\xc2\xa0 He came in and he made it clear that we would engage with Iran if Iran was willing to change its behavior.\xc2\xa0 And by taking that approach it made it clear to the world that Iran was the problem.\xc2\xa0 And that has allowed us to rally international support behind efforts to isolate Iran, to put pressure on Iran, to sanction Iran or individuals within Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that has had an impact, which I described earlier.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to pursue those efforts and intensify them in light of this very serious attempted assassination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you be any more specific about the next steps? Do you go to the Security Council?\xc2\xa0 What are the next steps?\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be sanctions --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t be more specific, but we will work with, as the Secretary of State said yesterday I believe, with other capitals, as well as in New York at the United Nations, in talking with our partners and international institutions about what transpired here, what a serious thing it is to target an ambassador in a third country, and why we need to take action to ensure that Iran is held accountable.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific steps to describe to you today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, The New York Times reported Sunday on a memo that the Justice Department gave the White House authorizing the assassination Anwar al-Awlaki.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm the existence of the memo, and will it be released, as Senator Feinstein has requested?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss matters of that nature.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say as a general matter of fact, that Mr. Awlaki was an operational leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 He was directly involved in plots to perform -- that would have resulted in terrorist acts against the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it is -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that when we assess this overall question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there any other Americans or targets on that list?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- as others who were here when this happened, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to engage in a conversation about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the environmental regulations that the House is talking about rolling back won\xe2\x80\x99t create any jobs.\xc2\xa0 But didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President at the Jobs Council the other day talk about the very choice between environmental regulations and job creation, and how this was a debate the nation needed to have, to talk about 10,000 jobs that come with it, 10,000 new cases of asthma?\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he acknowledge that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President does believe, as you know\xc2\xa0 -- because he launched the first ever substantial regulatory look-back so that this administration would scour the books to identify outdated or duplicative or overly burdensome regulations, and either minimize them or do away with them -- that there is an issue here with regulation that we need to address in a smart way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What my point is -- and this is a point that was made I think even today by AP in a fact check -- is that even if you agree with Republican policy proposals aimed at deregulation, there is no case to be made that if enacted those proposals would result in an immediate, positive impact on the economy or in job creation.\xc2\xa0 And so my point at the top was simply that there is a problem now that needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 The President has a plan to address the problem we have now, which is a need to grow the economy and create jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply -- if the answer is there is nothing we can do, nothing we should do, then that suggests that there is a willingness to live with 9.1 percent unemployment and to live with fairly modest economic growth -- the kind of modest economic growth that will not add to our employment rolls. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is not satisfied with that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has pushed the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 And the contrast that I think is important to make here in terms of the jobs -- what they have called the jobs plan that the Republicans have put forward contains within it in its cut taxes, cut regulations, cut spending, no measures that would have -- even if you believe everything within that package was meritorious, no measures that would have demonstrable impact on the economy and jobs in the short term.\xc2\xa0 And don\'t just take my word for it; Macro Economic Advisors, Moody\'s, they have assessed it, such as it is, and made that same point, even as they said that there are some positive proposals within it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not comparing it to the President\'s jobs bill, but just as a matter of principle.\xc2\xa0 The White House itself a few weeks ago decided not to go forward with an EPA regulation because of concern as to what the impact would be on the economy during a fragile time for the economy --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- let me just --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering why, when you do it, you guys are taking business and the economy into account, but when they do it, it\'s something else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My point is -- on that specific one, I think the issue here was creating uncertainty for businesses when, in fact, we were going to revisit these standards in two years.\xc2\xa0 That was the reason that the President laid out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But putting aside that specific one, my point is not that there might not be benefits to some streamlining or even elimination of some overly burdensome regulations -- the President has made that clear with his rollback -- but that there is no -- that is not a jobs plan.\xc2\xa0 Even if there are elements within it that are worth doing, that\'s not a jobs plan.\xc2\xa0 And the point that we\'re making, the President is making, I\'m making today, is that there is a priority right now that\'s widely felt by the American people that Washington needs to take positive action to help the economy grow and to help the economy create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question I wanted to ask is about whether or not the President agrees with his campaign manager, their strategy -- speaking about the Republicans in Congress -- their strategy is to suffocate the economy for the say what they think will be a political victory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, whether it\'s deliberate or not, by not taking action, anemic or modest economic growth and 9.1 percent unemployment feels pretty suffocating to most Americans who are experiencing it.\xc2\xa0 And this just goes to the point that I was making that there\'s an opportunity here for Congress to act in a positive way to do what outside economists say would boost growth by up to 2 percent next year and would add up to 1.9 million jobs next year.\xc2\xa0 That would be a substantial accomplishment for the American people -- and do it in a way that\'s entirely paid for, would not add a dime to the deficit -- pay for it in a way that is supported by a majority of the American people; pay for it in a way that\'s actually supported by a majority of Republicans, according to I believe Bloomberg\'s poll.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is an opportunity that should not be wasted.\xc2\xa0 There is a priority here that the American people have that is clear as day to anybody who looks at the data or has conversations out in the country with average Americans who are just trying to make ends meet:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do something on the economy.\xc2\xa0 There are proposals here that have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past that should enjoy it now, and they\xe2\x80\x99re paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President agrees with the verb "suffocate," just not necessarily that it\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with the President about that.\xc2\xa0 I think we agree that inaction has a suffocating effect on the economy.\xc2\xa0 No question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction about soldier Shalit\xe2\x80\x99s liberation in Israel, and does it help in the peace process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was just discussing that moments ago.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased by the reports that Mr. Shalit will be home soon with his family.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has called many times for his release and that his release is long overdue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the broader -- the question about the broader Middle East peace process, I mean, our focus is on, as you know\xc2\xa0 -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say many times that Palestinians and Israelis taking steps towards peace, taking steps towards direct negotiations, because the only way that the goal that they both seek can be achieved is through direct negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said on the Iranian plot that clearly plotting happened at senior levels of the Quds Force.\xc2\xa0 But both the intelligence chairs in the House and Senate said they believe that this had to have gone to the highest levels of the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 So does this administration believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible this plot could have been carried out without the knowledge of the highest levels of the Iranian government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a somewhat speculative assessment.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to say is that we know from the facts that it clearly involved senior levels of the Quds Force.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to speculate or go any further on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could it have been rogue effort, in your assessment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the government and I think that speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s as specific as I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton has said that Iran must be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 You talked about that.\xc2\xa0 Do we have -- have you heard yet from any European allies that they have agreed to step up their sanctions against Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are working with European allies and partners elsewhere around the world to discuss this matter.\xc2\xa0 This story just broke yesterday, as you know, and we\xe2\x80\x99re having these conversations right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to make clear the seriousness of this, the substantial evidence described by the Attorney General and others yesterday, and why we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to hold Iran accountable, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be continuing to do that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any actions to announce on behalf of other countries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yesterday you said that -- we were told the President was first notified in June.\xc2\xa0 Can you give a sense of how frequently the President was briefed on this and, over time, how much he was kept in the loop on the ongoing investigation?\xc2\xa0 And then, the timing of it -- it seems the arrest happened just days after the Americans in Iran, the hikers were released.\xc2\xa0 Is that timing just a coincidence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is just a coincidence.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, was first notified about this in June.\xc2\xa0 He was updated regularly on it and kept abreast of it, as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any more details than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back, yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans and Democrats have been making very different comments about those Occupy Wall Street protestors.\xc2\xa0 I mean, given the fact that the American Jobs Act was defeated yesterday in the Senate, does the White House plan to communicate with the protest, enlist them somehow to push forward the elements of the jobs bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President and others have said in the administration is that we understand the frustration that\xe2\x80\x99s being expressed by the protestors on Wall Street and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 It reflects the kind of sentiment that is driving the demand that Washington take action on behalf of middle-class Americans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it does go specifically to the point of Wall Street in the sense that actions were obviously taken by the previous administration and this one to ensure that the financial sector in this country did not collapse.\xc2\xa0 This President believes that was the right thing to do because it prevented an even more disastrous economic situation in this country.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes very firmly and fought hard for legislation that put in place rules of the road for Wall Street that would ensure that the kind of financial collapse that almost happened in this country could not happen again, and it would ensure that we would not have a situation where taxpayers would have to bail out institutions as they had to in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That legislation passed and was signed into law.\xc2\xa0 And since then, some members of Congress have been actively trying to water it down and others running for high office has been calling for its repeal.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible idea.\xc2\xa0 We think the American people, when made aware of it, agree with us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible idea.\xc2\xa0 The protections that are put in place through the Wall Street reform measure are designed to give consumers a fighting chance in that arena, to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not subject to abuses by credit card companies and to make sure that the kinds of actions that led or contributed to the recession could not happen again. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It goes right to the fact that Richard Cordray, the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee for the Consumer Financial Protection Board, is likely going to be held up by Republicans in the Senate, another indication that they don\'t share the interests of average Americans out there who feel like Wall Street should follow the rules, and the rules are clearly set out in that legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that that speaks to the kind of frustration that you\'re seeing through these protests.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why the President feels so strongly that we have to ensure that the Wall Street reforms he fought so hard to put into place are implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you don\'t know how high this assassination plot went up within the Iranian government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just said I\'m not going to be any more specific about it than I have been.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that it was more than likely that Iran\'s Supreme Leader knew about this plot?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Norah, I can\'t be more specific than I\'ve been.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you expect to rally the world, then, to further isolate Iran if you\'re not willing to say what elements, other than the Quds Force, was involved or knew about this assassination plot?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s be clear that the IRGC and the Quds Force is not some minor element of the Iranian government or military.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I think the fact that it was an attempted assassination of a protected diplomat would be -- it will be and is a matter of great concern to nations all around the world who have their diplomats positioned around the world.\xc2\xa0 This is a flagrant violation of international law.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t believe that we\'re going to have any difficulty in persuading other nations to agree with us that this is quite a serious, serious matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt from the Secretary of State and the Vice President, you yourself have said there\'s going to be no doubt persuading these other countries to take additional steps. What additional steps are you asking them to take?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you see the course that we have pursued in terms of sanctions and other measures that isolate and put pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Other countries have been doing that as well and we have worked with them prior to this incident to do that.\xc2\xa0 And it has dramatic effect, we believe, in Iran.\xc2\xa0 It has contributed to the further isolation of the Iranian regime and put pressure on them.\xc2\xa0 And those are the kind of actions that we\'re continuing to work on both unilaterally and bilaterally and multilaterally.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific about what you mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think sanctions are pretty specific.\xc2\xa0 We talked about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are multiple rounds of sanctions on Iran.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and they\'ve had an effect, and we\'re going to intensify the pressure and continue to work with our allies and partners around the world to hold up and make clear Iranian behavior -- and also make clear that they have a choice to make in terms of getting right by the international community.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made clear what that would entail.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State said today, we\'re going to hold them accountable.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you want to make the Iranians pay the price.\xc2\xa0 What do you want done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, I can repeat the answers I\'ve given.\xc2\xa0 You saw two individuals charged.\xc2\xa0 You saw sanctions levied on several more specific individuals, more action taken today against an airline that is related to this.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to take measures to put pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And as I\'ve also said, we don\'t take anything off the table in these matters, but we\'re focused on this and we know in the two and a half years plus that we\'ve been here that this approach has had an effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask one more.\xc2\xa0 The President knew about this plot back in June.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s National Security Advisor informed King Abdullah about it two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Why the lag time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mr. Donilon did discuss this with the King.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about any conversations that might have occurred prior to that or subsequent to that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously cooperate very closely with Saudi Arabia, an important ally, and we appreciate the statements the Saudis put out yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have anything more on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way in the back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 If the plot truly was planned by the Quds Force it\'s meant to be inherently provocative.\xc2\xa0 So how, then, does the administration plan to respond in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just fan the flames that the plotters would have been trying to fan themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re responding very concretely with actions that we know will have an impact on Iran and will make clear that this kind of behavior is unacceptable, and will further isolate and put pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly not interested in downplaying the seriousness of this, as I\'ve made clear and others have made clear.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think there\'s any danger in that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re taking concerted action.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to be working with our allies and partners, as well as the United Nations, to continue to isolate and put pressure on the Iranians and the Iranian regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that fine line, then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can you describe it to me again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, if the plot itself seems to mean to be provocative, attacking a diplomat, assassinating a diplomat is meant to be a provocative act.\xc2\xa0 So how do you respond in a way that doesn\'t just play into the attempts to be provocative?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think there is an alternative to holding Iran accountable for this.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing. It is a very serious escalation, a dangerous escalation of their behavior -- behavior that has a long history.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re taking action that we believe is appropriate and that we hope will, through the intensifying isolation and pressure on Iran, change their behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Oh sorry, one more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\'t the message from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Senate vote that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the President and Republicans to compromise over the elements of the job bill that they can compromise on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and the President has said, is that if the Senate did not pass the jobs act in its entirety or as a single bill, that we would then move to elements, component parts of the jobs act.\xc2\xa0 The Senate will do that, as Majority Leader Reid has said.\xc2\xa0 And we hope for, and expect, Republican support for these individual members -- measures, rather -- as I think leaders of the Republican Party and the House and the Senate have said would be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we will insist that every measure here deserves broad bipartisan support because they\xe2\x80\x99re the kinds of measures that have earned bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 And we will not be satisfied -- you can be sure -- if only one or two or three of them pass -- because all of them should pass.\xc2\xa0 And the plan was constructed in a way to have the kind of collective impact on the economy that would be a significant net positive for the American people and the American economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I point you to the outside analysis of the American Jobs Act, all of its component pieces, and if enacted what kind of impact that would be on the economy, in terms of job growth and economic growth. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we will -- we hope that the kind of expressions of support for some of the measures that we have seen, the individual measures, will be realized in votes for them as we move forward here.\xc2\xa0 But don\'t misunderstand me that we will not be satisfied if a measure does not succeed and reach the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could have passed a portion of the bill yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because we believe -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re making assumptions about behavior in the Congress that can never -- I mean, we heard last night, I believe, in Republican debate, suggestions that even the payroll tax cut extension and expansion isn\'t a good idea -- somehow a little Band-Aid.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re an American family out there, $1,500 is a lot more than a little Band-Aid next year.\xc2\xa0 How you can be for -- how you can support the Ryan budget, which would give an average of $200,000 additional in tax cuts to millionaires, and be against tax cuts for regular working folks in this country, 95 percent of Americans, is beyond me.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what we heard last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think that we can take anything for granted here. The fact is, is that the reason why we wanted a vote on the full measure is because we believe in every piece of it.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t just believe in every piece of it, the President doesn\'t just believe in every piece of it, but the vast majority of the American people believe in every piece of it, as data has shown. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep at it.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a more important priority right now.\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\'t think that ideological legislation that does not create a single job is the next order of business.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But officials say privately there\xe2\x80\x99s no plan on breaking it down into its component parts this week.\xc2\xa0 The President makes clear in his statements today that you want to see politically painful votes taken in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the focus appears to be as much on that as it is on passing the elements that you could get passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is just -- let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of this reporting and -- we would like nothing more than for all of this to pass and for the President to sign it.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said at the end of his press conference last week, he would like nothing more than for Congress to deprive him of the opportunity to run against a do-nothing Congress by actually doing something on the economy and jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His interest is in helping the economy, and in helping and putting people back to work.\xc2\xa0 You might argue, if you\xe2\x80\x99re being crassly political, that economic growth and job creation would be good for him politically.\xc2\xa0 So even if that were his motivation, it would be focused on getting all of this passed because of its positive impact on the economy and jobs in this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the idea that this is some political exercise, again, is just a fallacy, because it was designed, put together with component parts that were seen to be, legitimately, the kinds of things that Republicans had supported in the past, as well as Democrats. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A huge portion of this package is tax cuts -- tax cuts for working Americans -- tax cuts for every American who gets a paycheck; tax cuts for small businesses, what I think will be, if passed, the 18th tax cut for small businesses that this President has signed into law; incentives for businesses to hire veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, men and women with enormous qualifications who have sacrificed and done extraordinary things for their country and who are returning to a very difficult job market and deserve our help in getting jobs; as well as measures to put teachers back to work, 280,000 of them across the country who have been laid off. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the kind of smaller-than- hoped-for jobs reports is because even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen consistent private sector job growth, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen layoffs in the public sector.\xc2\xa0 And the layoffs have been largely of teachers.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, please, if Republicans in Congress think that this is a political exercise, they can deprive the President the opportunity to complain about their intransigence by voting for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration see the Senate vote on the China currency bill as actually harmful to U.S.-China relations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and others, we share the goal of the legislation in taking action to ensure that our workers and companies have a more level playing field with China, including addressing the under-valuation of their currency, an issue that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken about and certainly Secretary Geithner and others have spoken about. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aspects of the legislation do, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, raise concerns about consistency with our international obligations, which is why we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of discussing with Congress those issues.\xc2\xa0 And if this legislation were to advance, we would expect those concerns to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 President Obama spoke earlier today at the Forum on American Latino Heritage and his support in that community seems to be slipping a bit.\xc2\xa0 One recent poll showed it at 48 percent, down from about 60 percent in January.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that is?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that every American has been frustrated by the kind of economy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this year, the fact that it has not grown fast enough and that not enough jobs are being created.\xc2\xa0 And I think that frustration is reflected in polls that measure the President\xe2\x80\x99s support and job approval, and polls that measure Congress\xe2\x80\x99s support and job approval -- which I believe continues to hit record lows in every poll every organization takes and which -- again, we hear you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American people want Washington to focus on what matters:\xc2\xa0 jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Latino Americans are any different from any other Americans who are frustrated with what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing out there and frustrated with Washington, and the kind of dysfunction that we saw most vividly over the summer when one element of one party in the House of Representatives basically drove us to the brink and put at risk\xc2\xa0 -- raises the possibility of the potential that the United States of America would default on its obligations for the first time in its history.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is a case of the tail wagging the dog. And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not helpful and productive for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will the President do between now and the election to try to reach out to some of those voters who he\xe2\x80\x99s lost in that time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President is, again, focused on jobs and the economy, and that is something that all Americans are focused on.\xc2\xa0 He is also committed to comprehensive immigration reform, an issue that is obviously significant to many Americans.\xc2\xa0 And I note, as I have in the past, that he hopes and believes that there will be at some point a return to the kind of bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform that we used to have in this country, led by his predecessor as President, Republican George W. Bush, and the Republican nominee for President in the last election, John McCain, Senator of Arizona.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully we can rebuild that kind of bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform, and if we do, this President would very much like to see it passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just make -- you have been asking.\xc2\xa0 And then Macarena.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, you two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow quickly on Cheryl\xe2\x80\x99s China question, and then I have a South Korea question.\xc2\xa0 There is not that much, it seems like, that the President and the House Speaker John Boehner agree on these days.\xc2\xa0 Boehner today said that the China currency bill could set off a trade war.\xc2\xa0 And what I want to know is, beyond the fact that the President is hoping that concerns will be addressed in the future, is the President also concerned that the implications of those could be a trade war?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President is concerned about is what I just described, which are that there are issues here about compatibility and consistency with out international obligations. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to Congress and will continue to talk to Congress, and if this legislation were to advance, those issues would have to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 The underlying goals of the legislation are things that we share and we need -- there needs to be a level playing field for our businesses and for our workers, and China needs to address the undervaluation of its currency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think the posturing out of the Democratic caucus, that what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really described it in what I think are pretty specific terms about our feelings and our approach to this, and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work with members of Congress on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on South Korea, could you talk to us a little bit, with that trade pact about to be passed now into law, about what are the most important, outstanding issues that the President and the South Korean leader are going to be discussing?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be focused on China?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be focused on North Korea? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with regard to Friday\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Detroit, is Korea poised to make a guarantee that they are going to buy a certain number of U.S. cars?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything like that that you can preview for us about why they chose -- why you chose that plant and what in terms of the auto piece is going to come out of the state visit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start with -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked.\xc2\xa0 This is a very important, significant state visit.\xc2\xa0 It comes at a time that\xe2\x80\x99s really a high point in the bilateral relationship and in our alliance with South Korea.\xc2\xa0 And it marks an alliance that has matured over the last two years into a partnership building peace and prosperity globally. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This establishment of a new economic partnership will create jobs and economic growth here in the U.S., as well as in Korea.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very hopeful that Congress, as you said, will act to approve the trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 And the President will obviously sign it if Congress does that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as Friday goes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say many times that he wants -- the fact that Americans buy and are able to buy Kias and Hyundais here in the United States is fine, but he wants Koreans -- as well as others in other countries -- to be buying Chevys, Jeeps, Fords, and other American cars, to be able to do that.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the visit will highlight the trade agreement and the potential that the trade agreement creates for opportunities that American car companies in particular will have to sell their products overseas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a specific deal or agreement announced?\xc2\xa0 Will Korea buy Chevy Sonics or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the trade agreement is a pretty significant deal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one -- I promised you in the red.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think more pressure or more sanctions will work on Iran?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your evidence, what of the sanctions will work this time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, the Iranian economy is not growing for the first time in years.\xc2\xa0 There is almost a state of disarray economically in Iran.\xc2\xa0 The isolation that Iran is under is apparent to anybody who is a global observer or expert on the region.\xc2\xa0 Its closest ally, the Syrian President and the Syrian regime, is under immense pressure because President Assad has demonstrated that he is no longer fit to lead in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is a sentiment not just held by this government, but by governments across the globe. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Iranian isolation has never been so intense and the pressure on Iran has never been so intense.\xc2\xa0 And we intend to continue to work with our international partners to ratchet that up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:15 P.M.
