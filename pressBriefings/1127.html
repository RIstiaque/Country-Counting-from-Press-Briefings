EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements, so I will go straight to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could tell us when the White House became aware that Pakistanis had arrested people who had assisted in the operation to raid bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound in Abbottabad?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific information for you about that report.\xc2\xa0 I can say that our relationship with Pakistan is extremely important.\xc2\xa0 It is also complicated.\xc2\xa0 And we have made that clear and been quite candid about that for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it is important to remember that the relationship is important because it helps our national security interest to maintain it.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan has worked with us to go after terrorism and terrorists.\xc2\xa0 More terrorists have been killed on Pakistani soil than in any other country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we continue to work with the Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes we have difficult issues to work through with them, but it remains an important relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there appears to be a pattern.\xc2\xa0 These arrests aside, you had an event -- episode a couple weeks ago where U.S. intelligence shared information with the Pakistanis regarding two bomb-making compounds, and then the militants apparently fled.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have -- is he frustrated with this kind of pattern? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you what the Senate Intelligence Committee asked last week of the deputy CIA director, which is, on a scale of one to 10, where would you rank Pakistani cooperation on matters of counterterrorism?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without addressing that specific ranking, I would say that we acknowledge that it is a complicated relationship, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty candid.\xc2\xa0 And I think we have also made clear that the cooperation we do get is vital and essential to our war against terrorism and terrorists.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we will continue that relationship for precisely that reason.\xc2\xa0 And when we have issues, we deal with them.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there was, in the wake of the successful mission against Osama bin Laden, we have reached out and engaged with the Pakistani government and our counterparts in Pakistan at many levels, precisely because this relationship is so important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems that the administration is merely accepting the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated relationship.\xc2\xa0 Are you doing anything to improve the relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I just said.\xc2\xa0 We work constantly to improve the relationship, to improve the cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And whatever number you pick on the scale of cooperation, that number represents significant success in combating terrorism and eliminating terrorists -- terrorists who threaten Pakistan, terrorists who threaten the United States and threaten our allies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t do this except with those priorities in mind.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not always an easy relationship, but it is a vital one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan -- the President is meeting with Secretary Gates today.\xc2\xa0 Is Afghanistan drawdown on the agenda?\xc2\xa0 And have you received a recommendation from the Pentagon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has a weekly meeting with Secretary Gates.\xc2\xa0 That is what this meeting is -- and with the Vice President when he\xe2\x80\x99s in town. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan routinely comes up in those weekly meetings.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out the weekly meetings with Secretary Gates or the weekly meetings with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 So I would simply leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the second question, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, the President will be looking at recommendations from his commanders, including General Petraeus, having discussions with his commanders, Secretary Gates, his national security team going forward.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a blow by blow about when those meetings are taking place and the content of those meetings, but he said -- the President did -- that he will make a decision soon about the beginning of the drawdown.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would make the point that this is the continuation, the implementation of a process he set in motion in December of 2009.\xc2\xa0 This is not a reopening of review of our policy; it is the implementation of his policy, which is succeeding, is making progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The stated goals -- disrupt, dismantle, defeat al Qaeda -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had enormous success in achieving that goal.\xc2\xa0 Stopping the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had significant progress in achieving that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As he reviews the options, he will obviously consult with a number of people.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been a deeply engaged participant in the Afghanistan policy from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he has chaired monthly Situation Room meetings on AfPak, as we call it.\xc2\xa0 And of course, Afghanistan and Pakistan are elements of his national security conversations all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will go in order here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Senate Republican Leader Jon Kyl said today that July 1st was the Biden group\xe2\x80\x99s goal for a deal on the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if the White House is also envisioning that timeline, end of next week, and if the President is intending to get involved directly in these meetings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly endorse the idea that we need to make progress in these talks, as we have, and expect that we will continue to make progress.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a deadline for you.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the Vice President has spoken to this, and I would refer you to some of his comments.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, was there a second question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obama\xe2\x80\x99s involvement?\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is regularly involved, and he will I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as this process moves forward, engage even more directly with leaders.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that he is frequently updated on the progress of the negotiations by the Vice President; by the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff, Bruce Reed; by other members of his economic team.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to be having those -- getting those updates, and he will engage directly at the appropriate time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Pakistan again, and the fact that you keep talking about this relationship as being complicated.\xc2\xa0 At any point looking down the road, does the administration foresee a scenario where you have to have tough love?\xc2\xa0 Where you really have to start looking at perhaps the aid to Pakistan in order to bring that friendship back to the middle?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Dan, that we are very clear-eyed about this, and we pursue this relationship and value it and state its importance precisely because it is in the national security interests of the United States of America to have this relationship and to maintain the cooperation that we do get, the significant cooperation that we do get from Pakistan in this incredibly important and volatile region of the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that we are remotely na\xc3\xafve about the challenges in the relationship, in the region, and in dealing with the variety of issues that confront us.\xc2\xa0 But I would say again, it is important to remember the successes we have had -- successes that have come, in many cases, precisely because we have this cooperation.\xc2\xa0 That is why we actively work to ensure that we have cooperation going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there will be no divorce in this relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made on debt talks, how would you rate that progress?\xc2\xa0 Significant progress?\xc2\xa0 Is it more progress than progress that we heard last week or two weeks ago?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think that, as you know, we have stepped up the pace of meetings.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has had a second meeting today.\xc2\xa0 He had one yesterday; he\xe2\x80\x99ll have another one tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are interested in moving this process forward.\xc2\xa0 No one suggested it is easy and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest by stating the fact that we believe that the talks have made progress that we -- that they\xe2\x80\x99re all sitting around a table and laughing it up because it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 These are hard issues and obviously we have a lot of differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the stakes are high in the sense that everyone agrees we have to have significant deficit reduction and everyone agrees, as the sort of parallel issue here, that we need to raise the debt ceiling so that we do not default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 People have -- those participants in those negotiations have brought a level of seriousness to them that is essential to making the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give any predictions or percentages on how much progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made or how optimistic I am about the ultimate success of those talks because they are difficult, but we do remain optimistic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scale of one to 10?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I won\xe2\x80\x99t rate it.\xc2\xa0 But -- yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A new study by the Center for Public Integrity found that nearly 200 of the President\xe2\x80\x99s biggest donors have landed plum government jobs and advisory posts, won millions of dollars in federal contracts for their businesses, and attended elite White House meetings.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that this administration looks for the most qualified candidates who represent Americans from all walks of life when it makes appointments.\xc2\xa0 The administration also has across the board the toughest ethics standards in history, including a bold commitment to transparency, which I have discussed frequently from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the people we have appointed, the President has appointed, to key positions all have sterling academic credentials, years of public service and private sector experience that make them eminently qualified for the positions to which they were appointed.\xc2\xa0 And I would make the point here that having enacted these ethical -- high ethical standards, the highest in history, and having pursued and delivered on a level of transparency that is unprecedented, it is important to note that being a supporter does not qualify you for a job or guarantee you a job, but it does not disqualify you, obviously.\xc2\xa0 So we stand by all of our appointments.\xc2\xa0 We believe they are enormously qualified for the jobs that they hold.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how does that square with what the President said in his announcement speech in 2007?\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cynics and the lobbyists and the special interests who\xe2\x80\x99ve turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.\xc2\xa0 They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills.\xc2\xa0 They get the access while you get to write a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe time for that politics is over.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, right, but this is -- we were talking about -- you asked me about supporters of the President who may have been donors who have gotten positions.\xc2\xa0 And I would point out to the fact that those -- the people who got those positions got them because of their credentials.\xc2\xa0 They also happened to be donors in some cases.\xc2\xa0 There are, obviously, numerous and far more -- far many more cases of people who weren\xe2\x80\x99t donors who were appointed to jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot different from the problem that exists in Washington, existed in Washington, with special interests having lobbying success here in terms of the effect that has on legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s produced in Congress and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 And we have been incredibly aggressive in that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, we are -- again, you -- it is important to remember the kinds of transparency -- the kind of transparency we have made a regular practice here, including releasing the WAVES logs, something that was never done before, in terms of visitors to the White House and the other measures we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in terms of the -- what you can and cannot do in the wake of serving in this administration in terms of lobbying and that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken important measures that qualify the praise that this administration has gotten for its high ethical standards.\xc2\xa0 And we stand by that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following up on that, are you saying that raising or bundling $100,000, $500,000 does not give a person any leg up in looking for an administration job?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am saying that.\xc2\xa0 I am saying that the President appoints people based on their qualifications.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has nothing to do with raising half a million dollars?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I think that -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t raise a half a million dollars.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t raise any money.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m standing here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eighty percent --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that we -- the President made clear that he would make political appointments as every President before him has.\xc2\xa0 But we have enacted ethical standards and levels of transparency that are unprecedented, that we believe should give the American people the kind of confidence that they have lacked in the past; that the people that the President has appointed to these jobs are highly qualified and have the credentials necessary to perform their duties.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So nearly 80 percent of people who bundled more than $500,000 got key administration positions.\xc2\xa0 That has nothing to do with the money that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, we can have this discussion.\xc2\xa0 Those people are highly qualified individuals who happen to be highly successful in the things that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in life.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is I would -- look at the people we\xe2\x80\x99ve appointed.\xc2\xa0 Look at their credentials.\xc2\xa0 Look at their qualifications.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And look at the money they\xe2\x80\x99ve raised.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a factor?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it is not a disqualification for office to have been a supporter of the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be wrong to reward people for the hard work of raising a half a million --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would be wrong if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t qualified.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would it be wrong to reward --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we stand by -- it would be wrong if they were not qualified.\xc2\xa0 I think I answered your question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would it be wrong to take that as a -- consider that as a factor, that hard work of raising all that money, half a million dollars?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said everything I can say about this, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered your question.\xc2\xa0 It would be wrong to appoint someone who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t qualified to the job, and the President has appointed highly qualified individuals to the positions that he has appointed as President, and we stand by those appointments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other -- golf.\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered this, just ignore it, but has -- is the President going to be discussing the debt and policy and things like with Boehner?\xc2\xa0 Or are they just going to golf --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said from here before, Chip, that this is a social occasion.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- that we will not complete our budget negotiations on the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be mentioned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be, but there is not an agenda.\xc2\xa0 There are no talking points.\xc2\xa0 This is simply an effort to get together outside of an office, outside of the normal venues that Presidents and Speakers of the House tend to get together and develop further the relationship that the President and the Speaker already have developed in the many meetings and conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had already.\xc2\xa0 But -- so I think it -- I assume, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for everyone here to assume that they will discuss all the -- in a general way, some of the business out there that they have between them, including the deficit-reduction talks.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an agenda.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have an expected outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think I can say with great confidence that they will not wrap up the 18th hole and come out and say that we have a deal.\xc2\xa0 But I think that for the broader purpose of the work that needs to be done in a bipartisan way in Washington, this social occasion is a good thing because establishing -- spending a number of hours together in that kind of environment I think can only help improve the chances of bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 It certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt it, unless someone wins really big.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the investigation, I addressed people who have gotten posts.\xc2\xa0 But another issue --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The investigation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This -- about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Report?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Report, okay.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, the report also brings up the idea that some people who have raised a lot of money work for companies that have gotten stimulus money, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the vast majority of companies that got stimulus money -- a process, by the way, which is largely done in agencies by career employees of the federal government in terms of the bids and that sort of thing -- the vast majority of companies were not donors, were not -- did not have people who were bundlers working for them.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- people were appointed on the merits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But $13.8 million for Level 3 Communications after you have a few bundlers is not chump change. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money -- $13.8 million in stimulus money if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few bundlers on the team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to explain to me what the question is, $13.8 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that pass the journalistic smell test?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, it does not disqualify you to get -- to work for this administration.\xc2\xa0 It certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t disqualified you in any previous administration to have been a supporter of the President of the United States and to have helped raise money for the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nor does it qualify you or get you a job.\xc2\xa0 You have to have the skills and credentials to do it.\xc2\xa0 And our ethical standards are unmatched by any previous administration.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts at transparency are unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not just me saying it, it is outside groups who have said that.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the fact that individuals who have been appointed also supported the President is hardly a story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s an outside group that\xe2\x80\x99s saying big fundraisers have gotten more than 3,000 White House meetings, so that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like -- it sounds like money has --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does it, Mike?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re just throwing out things here, Mike.\xc2\xa0 We have meetings.\xc2\xa0 By the way, we have meetings that are then made public in a way that has never been the case before through WAVES release information.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing stuff up without any suggestion of any impropriety, which, by the way, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any suggestion of any impropriety.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, having worked a long time with the Vice President on the Recovery Act, it is noted for -- and you can talk to the independent IG\xe2\x80\x99s that oversee, it has been remarkable in its level of transparency and the lack of abuse and fraud.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of that, and we stand by it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on Libya, you guys are going to send some information to the Hill today.\xc2\xa0 Are you hopeful that what you send to the Hill today will answer their questions and allow the operation to go forward?\xc2\xa0 Or where do things go after today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do hope this afternoon to provide to Congress a letter and a report over 30 pages on our Libya mission.\xc2\xa0 We think that it will answer the questions that members have about the mission.\xc2\xa0 It will also include within it a legal analysis that explains our position that the President has acted in a way -- in a manner that is consistent with the War Powers resolution. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the support for the overall mission, the support for the goal of protecting Libyan civilians and holding Colonel Qaddafi accountable will continue.\xc2\xa0 It is support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had from Congress in the past and we expect it to continue, because now is not the time to send mixed messages as we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in that mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to remind you of the bigger picture here, about what the President said he would do and what he has done.\xc2\xa0 Working with a broad coalition, the United States intervened and saved thousands of lives, saved essentially the citizens of a city of three-quarters of a million people, averting a massacre and stopping the advance of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces; enforcing a no-fly zone; enforcing an arms embargo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also, the President did, kept his commitment to the American people to limit our involvement in Libya.\xc2\xa0 He said at the time -- and it will -- it is now and will always be the case, he will send no ground troops to Libya.\xc2\xa0 After an initial phase -- days, not weeks, as he said, as he promised -- the United States stepped back from its lead role in the Libya mission, turned over lead responsibility to NATO, and has been in a support mission ever since. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Most importantly, the mission has been effective in fulfilling the goals set out by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 -- protecting civilians, enforcing an arms embargo, enforcing a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 And we think that as that mission has been effective, it has helped the Transitional National Council of Libya to assert itself.\xc2\xa0 It has allowed the TNC to work with the contact group and others as it has begun to envision what a post-Qaddafi Libya would look like.\xc2\xa0 It has embraced democratic reform, democratic process; the insurance of basic civil rights and human rights for the people of Libya. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are all positive developments that flow directly from the decisions the President has made.\xc2\xa0 We believe Congress has supported that in the past and should continue to support it and will.\xc2\xa0 And we continue, as we have said from the beginning, to welcome the support from Congress that would come, in this case, in the form of the resolution put forward by a bipartisan group of senators, including Senator McCain and Senator Kerry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very briefly, 10 lawmakers filed a lawsuit on Libya today.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys seen the lawsuit?\xc2\xa0 Do you take it seriously? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen the stories.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say that we believe that the report that we will be sending up to Congress later today answers a lot of the questions that members have, continues a process of consultation that has been broad and deep and consistent.\xc2\xa0 More now, but continues the process that allowed me to say, I believe last week, that there have been 40 distinct engagements with Congress in terms of consultation on Libya.\xc2\xa0 This is part of that process.\xc2\xa0 So we feel very confident that we will be able to answer the questions that Congress has. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you describe the relationship with Pakistan as uneasy and complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said \xe2\x80\x9ccomplicated,\xe2\x80\x9d but yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you said it\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy relationship. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Uneasy was my word, I concede that.\xc2\xa0 But one word you didn\xe2\x80\x99t use was \xe2\x80\x9callies.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is Pakistan an ally of the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Pakistan is a partner of the United States, an important partner in fighting terrorism, fighting the terrorists who in that region plotted the attack on the United States on September 11th of 2001. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is partner different than ally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are diplomatic nuances between these words.\xc2\xa0 The important thing is Pakistan has been an important partner.\xc2\xa0 It is a relationship that we work very hard on.\xc2\xa0 We candidly acknowledge that it is complicated.\xc2\xa0 It is difficult.\xc2\xa0 But it is very important. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we have the -- the cooperation we do get from the Pakistanis has been vital to our efforts.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we continue to work with the Pakistanis to ensure that that cooperation continues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re probably familiar with a quote from candidate Obama in December 2007, in response to a questioner from the Boston Globe, I believe it was:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHistory has shown\xe2\x80\x9d -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting -- \xe2\x80\x9cHistory has shown us time and time again, however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the legislative branch.\xc2\xa0 It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 My question is, in compliance with the War Powers resolution, will the President begin withdrawal of American forces in the action against Libya this weekend after the 90-day period is up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, as you know, there are no forces to withdraw from Libya.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just make that clear.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, the President has acted in a manner that is consistent with the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 I will point you to -- not being a lawyer -- to the legal analysis that will be part of the packet of information provided to Congress this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I point to one specific point, please?\xc2\xa0 The timeline, 60-day timeline --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the War Powers --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no Congressional resolution in support --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a constitutional debate that has existed in this country for a long, long time, volumes of which have been written about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President supports the War Powers --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the reasoning that we have put forward will appear and is being provided to Congress about why he has acted in a manner that is consistent with the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into that here.\xc2\xa0 I will point you to the analysis written by actual attorneys and not just ones who play them on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow on Pakistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said consistently that the White House would welcome a resolution of support from Congress.\xc2\xa0 But -- which I can understand why the White House would feel that way.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real question not welcoming a resolution of support, but welcoming a congressional debate, and it may be able to come out in support and maybe it won\xe2\x80\x99t?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have certainly not restrained Congress from having a debate.\xc2\xa0 And we have been actively consulting with Congress, again, more than 40 distinct engagements with Congress to consult with them and to inform them about the mission in Libya.\xc2\xa0 We are providing a report this afternoon of more than 30 pages that we believe answers in detail the questions that Congress has put forward about the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, Laura, to -- and including the legal analysis that answers the questions that I think you and Mike have -- it is important, too, to remember what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here:\xc2\xa0 the action the President took, the promises he\xe2\x80\x99s made and has kept about the nature of U.S. involvement, and where we are now in terms of our supporting role where we have no troops on the ground; where we are supporting a NATO mission that is fulfilling a United Nations Security Council Resolution to protect Libyan civilians and to enforce a no-fly zone and an arms embargo.\xc2\xa0 That mission has been successful thus far.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to continue it so that it continues to be successful to protect Libyans and to allow the space necessary for the opposition to move forward with building a future for Libya and for Libyans in the post-Qaddafi world.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress not to send mixed messages about a goal that we think most members of Congress share.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in order for Congress not to send mixed messages, does that mean you only want a congressional resolution if it comes out in support?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve said what we have in the past about things that have been voted on that we think are not necessarily helpful -- not necessary or helpful.\xc2\xa0 But we do support the mission -- I mean, the resolution put forward by senators -- a number of senators, Republicans and Democrats -- that reinforce the goals that we set out in pursuing this very limited, very specific mission with specific objectives and specific limitations on U.S. involvement. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 You repeatedly articulated the argument for being in Libya and the limited nature of the conflict.\xc2\xa0 If the White House is unable to persuade a majority of the House and Senate that those arguments are legitimate, valid, true, what have you, should the mission be allowed to succeed even if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the legal reasoning will be available to you to review and analyze.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that some of the resolutions -- the questions that were part of the House resolution -- and we have endeavored in this report to we believe answer a lot of those questions -- that resolution also said that there should be no U.S. ground troops.\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, the President said that on day one.\xc2\xa0 We agree.\xc2\xa0 And the President is absolutely committed to his assertion that there will be no U.S. ground troops in Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, anticipating what may or may not come out of Congress in the future is not, I think, a helpful exercise at this point.\xc2\xa0 I encourage you to look at the report that we\xe2\x80\x99re making available later this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just on Pakistan, are you declining to say what the administration will do in the wake of these arrests or to comment on the substance of the arrests at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about Pakistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not commenting on the substance of those reports.\xc2\xa0 I am simply saying that we are actively engaged with the Pakistanis. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on that, when you look at the scope of actions by Pakistan before the Osama bin Laden operation and since, how would you gauge the reliability of Pakistan as a -- as you put it -- partner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated relationship that is not perfect and that requires a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 We give it that attention because it\xe2\x80\x99s important to do that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to our national security interest to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give percentage assessments or one-to-10 assessments of the level of cooperation.\xc2\xa0 I would note that in the wake of that operation, which obviously was a major development and there was a reaction to it, we have worked hard to continue the cooperation that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 And we have received some cooperation from Pakistan continuing since the bin Laden mission. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the relative level of cooperation.\xc2\xa0 But it does continue.\xc2\xa0 And we are working to make sure that it continues from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for one to 10 or a percentage.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you, Jay, are they reliable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they\xe2\x80\x99re reliable in -- they are important partners in this effort.\xc2\xa0 It is a complicated relationship.\xc2\xa0 And one way to answer your question that, yes, they have been reliable in providing important information that has led to successful missions against terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty important fact to remember.\xc2\xa0 And they have also had important successes in the fight against terrorists who threaten Pakistan -- important to remember, shared enemies, if you will -- and, again, saying that while acknowledging that it is a complicated relationship. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to the deficit talks, Monday in North Carolina, the President said the deficit talks give us a little bit of room to continue to do some smart things like the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Given that, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what kind of reaction folks have had from the Hill, Republicans primarily, on the extension or a renewal of the current one or an extension -- adding to the employer --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, first of all, conversations notwithstanding and what the President said, there is no -- we are not submitting proposals to Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember.\xc2\xa0 We are -- like I think a lot of people -- listening to ideas about -- ideas for how we might continue to grow the economy and create jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The nature of the discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the talks led by the Vice President I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into, but obviously, as the President said, we are interested in ideas for how we can continue to grow the economy and create jobs, even as we take measures to significantly reduce the deficit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again -- and this is all because we have -- as we engage in this important exercise with members and leaders of Congress, it is important to remember what the end goal here is.\xc2\xa0 The end goal is not to simply reduce the deficit and cut the debt-to-GDP ratio because those are worthy goals in and of themselves.\xc2\xa0 The goal is to strengthen our economy, is to position our economy so that it will grow and create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 And an agreement, we believe, done properly in a balanced way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do the opposite -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reduce growth, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restrain job creation -- will have, if you will, a compound positive effect because it will demonstrate to Americans as well as others that we have control over our deficits, that we have taken a balanced approach to deal with our long-term debt problem, and that will create some confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the sense of the White House that the existing tax cuts have helped the economy --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and that the unemployment rate -- which is 9.1 right now -- might otherwise be higher without them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think that that is absolutely the case.\xc2\xa0 When you have provided more money through the payroll tax cut in particular, as well as the extension of the middle-class tax cuts, provided extra money to Americans who are at income levels that mean as a matter of economic analysis that they are much more likely to pump that money back into the economy, I think that is a very helpful thing and has helped the growth that we have seen this year and has helped the job creation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an opinion that I share, but it is an opinion generated by actual economists.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one final -- the reaction from the Hill generally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction to report.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask them, but again, nobody up there is submitting proposals that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of to react to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is it the legal position of the administration that you\xe2\x80\x99ll still be acting consistent with the War Powers Act on the 91st day of the operation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have been acting consistent with the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue the mission.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 The legal analysis I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to the lawyers, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll see this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to assume that the President personally believes the War Powers resolution is constitutional?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 There is a long debate about this, as you all know, and, you, Scott, you probably in particular know, and the material that\xe2\x80\x99s been written and testified to about this could fill this room -- over the years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would point out that there has been some expressions on the Hill about this issue that are inconsistent with expressions in the past about the constitutionality of the War Powers resolution, and I think that, if nothing else, testifies to the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of debate about it.\xc2\xa0 This President believes that he has acted in a manner that is consistent with the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 Again, I point you to the report that we are releasing, providing to Congress later today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama said last year that he was going to, this year, go to Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Does he still intend to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed his mind about the trip?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no real answer to that because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a discussion with him about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make on travel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he did say he was going to go, so as far as you know he\xe2\x80\x99s still --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the golf game, is he doing any trash talking in advance of Sunday, or is he going to let his golf do the talking for him?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have heard no trash talking from the President on this.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President enjoys golf and plays it when he can, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he would say that he is an expert golfer.\xc2\xa0 And I hear that the Speaker of the House is quite good, as well as the governor of Ohio.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Expectations.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a golfer, but there are ways to measure this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s handicap? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Classified.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, seriously, this is about -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, too, the President plays golf because I think a lot of Presidents who occupy this house and this West Wing look for ways to literally get outdoors where you\xe2\x80\x99re not surrounded by people and then you can -- I think the process itself is one he enjoys as much as the game, which he does enjoy.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s a competitive guy.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not making predictions or doing any trash talking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is -- I mean, this is a big deal.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if he goes and lets Boehner beat him, that\xe2\x80\x99s just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to look --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s about winning or losing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- the getting together for a few hours and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he is a lousy golfer?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- developing the relationship that they already have.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously spent a fair amount of time together, mostly in the Oval Office during the CR discussions.\xc2\xa0 But he looks forward to doing this and I think broadly thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a worthwhile endeavor simply because I think, as a member of the House Republican Caucus who was here for the visit with the President last week said upon departing the White House, that any day Democrats and Republicans sit across from each other and actually exchange ideas and talk, instead of shouting past each other -- these are my words now -- shouting past each other on cable TV or through other media, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good for the process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It may move you a little bit closer towards the kind of compromise that we need to get the things done that the American people expect us to get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it takes a few hours out on the golf course to help that process, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a worthwhile thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, General Petraeus is in town.\xc2\xa0 Is it expected that before he goes back to Afghanistan he will meet with the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about meetings, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply refer you to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, which is that the President will have discussions with General Petraeus, who is the commanding general in Afghanistan, and others about -- to hear their ideas and their recommendations about the beginning of a drawdown, which I hasten to remind people is the implementation of a policy that he articulated in December of 2009, including specifically the fact that we would begin the drawdown in July of 2011.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that acting consistent with the War Powers Act is legally the same thing as complying with the act?\xc2\xa0 And when he ran for election, is that what he meant when he said he supported Presidents abiding by the War Powers Act?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I can parse this any more than I have, except to say that we have acted in a manner consistent with the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 The legal analysis will be supplied as part of this report to Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here in terms of the mission in Libya, what we are doing, what we have done, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing, what it does not include.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important context when you look at the reasoning here and the resolution and the kind of engagement that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of like saying you\xe2\x80\x99re just a little bit pregnant, we\xe2\x80\x99re not really in combat --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that I may have -- although I will continue to, if you guys want to hear it, give the answers that I have given you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m a lawyer and to delve into that.\xc2\xa0 I think that the reasoning and the analysis that that will be provided in a short period of time will help answer the questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, since all the serious War Powers questions have been asked, I want to get back to golf.\xc2\xa0 Has the Vice President done any trash talking?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think because he\xe2\x80\x99s Vice President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think because he\xe2\x80\x99s, as you know, leading these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to send a signal that somehow these negotiations will continue on the golf course, but that is obviously a topic of conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to arise -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that it won\xe2\x80\x99t -- among many other things.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s a good partner to have in general, I think, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re playing golf or you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out nuclear arms treaties or budget negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Partner or ally?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seven handicap -- seven handicap had nothing to do with it? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, April, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question, and I think that for the diplomatese, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 For me, as a layman, I think partner, ally -- the important point here is that we have an important relationship with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 They have been our partner and ally in the traditional meaning of the word in the fight against terrorism.\xc2\xa0 It is not always a perfect relationship.\xc2\xa0 It is not always an easy relationship.\xc2\xa0 We have our differences.\xc2\xa0 We discuss them directly.\xc2\xa0 We meet with our Pakistani counterparts regularly, precisely because we need to discuss those issues, and to further the cooperation that we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the investigation still going on as to their knowledge of Osama bin Laden being where he was?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. still questioning government officials in Pakistan about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously we have worked with the Chinese and the Russians on that issue and will continue to, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that this report to Congress is going to settle the debate on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 Or is he expecting to have to further defend his actions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t predict the future on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that it will answer a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 I think that it will continue the tradition of consulting with Congress in a robust manner on this mission that began even before the mission started and was launched. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But obviously if as the mission continues and more -- if there are more questions raised, we will work with Congress and consult with Congress going forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just two questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Giles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 On the deficit, Director Sperling spoke a little bit about David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s approach to deficit cutting, which includes raising revenues, chiefly on the wealthier.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree that this is a significant example of conservatives being willing to raise taxes as well as cut spending?\xc2\xa0 And is it an example that is being used in any of these negotiations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that it\xe2\x80\x99s been brought up in any negotiations, but the -- and then on the broader point, I think -- I would say to that, Giles, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, which is that each country that is dealing with deficit and debt issues has to deal with those issues in their own way.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stretch an analogy in either direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our position, which you know, is that the way to -- we have put forward a path to achieving dramatic reductions in our deficits, $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years, in a balanced way, in a way that spreads the burden and the sacrifice, in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair, that does not put the burden disproportionately on our seniors, on disabled children, the families of those children, and that we believe will -- because it will maintain the investments in education and innovation and infrastructure that are so key to building the foundation of this economy for the 21st century, it will enhance our capacity to grow and create jobs in the near term, even as it gets our long-term balance sheet in a better position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that includes dealing with spending through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 And you can have absolute positions and pledges that you sign that are abstract and based on politically potent positioning.\xc2\xa0 But if you really want to solve this problem, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it by going after the 12 percent of spending that\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary non-defense.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a fair way by ending Medicare as we know it and shifting the burden of health care costs so dramatically onto seniors.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, having said that, I think that there has been progress in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 There has been a willingness to allow all ideas to be brought to the table, and we are encouraged by that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Syria?\xc2\xa0 Can I talk Syria?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sirius Radio.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, I just want take one more stab at this War Powers thing.\xc2\xa0 Is effective solutions and promising and delivering on specifics, is that more important to the President than strict compliance to the satisfaction of Congress with War Powers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you want to hear my answer again, or should I just refer you to my remarks?\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best to answer this.\xc2\xa0 And I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have questions after we -- you read this information that we\xe2\x80\x99re sending to Congress, but I think it will help answer a lot of the questions that you have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second one was on Boeing and the Dreamliner.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday in the Senate, Senators Graham and DeMint both called out not only the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, but also members of the staff and futures members of the staff, and John Bryson potentially, on their position saying the President is choosing -- or that the National Labor Relations Board is preferring jobs in union states versus non-union workers or so-called Right to Work states.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the President has a reaction to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, and what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, that we need to refer questions on the action by the NLRB to the NLRB, because it is a independent body, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an independent agency\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement action.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t get involved in particular enforcement matters of independent agencies. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, having said that -- but I would also say that the President has a strong record on labor rights.\xc2\xa0 But we also support a strong private sector in the United States that helps our economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has been working so hard on, including with his Jobs and Competitiveness Council meeting on Monday in North Carolina.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the -- on Boeing in particular, look, I mean, Boeing is a great American company and it\xe2\x80\x99s doing good things.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re growing, they\xe2\x80\x99re increasing exports, and they\xe2\x80\x99re investing here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the President has set a goal of doubling our exports over five years -- a goal he set last year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on track to do that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it in part because we have Jim McNerney\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on the Export Council. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that the agency here is independent and it\xe2\x80\x99s an enforcement action, and that to assert that we somehow are against robust growth of private sector companies, and especially companies that invest here and increase our exports, is just wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in South Carolina, is that good for doubling exports?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- on the enforcement matter I got to refer you to the agency involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 1:58 P.M.
