BST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us here in London.\xc2\xa0 I have with me today Ben Rhodes, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll give you a briefing on this visit so far as well as an update on events for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Before he does that, though, I have a statement by the President regarding some news involving Chrysler\xe2\x80\x99s full repayment and final repayment of its TARP money today, making a final payment of $5.1 billion.\xc2\xa0 The statement by the President is as follows:<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chrysler\xe2\x80\x99s repayment of its outstanding loans to the U.S. Treasury and American taxpayers marks a significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis announcement comes six years ahead of schedule and just two years after emerging from bankruptcy, allowing Chrysler to build on its progress and continue to grow as the economy recovers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSupporting the American auto industry required making some tough decisions, but I was not willing to walk away from the workers at Chrysler and the communities that rely on this iconic American company.\xc2\xa0 I said if Chrysler and all its stakeholders were willing to take the difficult steps necessary to become more competitive, America would stand by them.\xc2\xa0 And we did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhile there is more work to be done, we are starting to see stronger sales, additional shifts at plants, and signs of strength in the auto industry and our economy, a true testament to the resolve and determination of American workers across the nation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s the end of the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement.\xc2\xa0 I would add that since June of 2009, the American auto industry has added 115,000 jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I\'ll turn it over to Ben.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll take -- depending on the nature of your questions, we\'ll each take questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to, before we take your questions, give you some updates on the visit so far and plans for tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was in very good spirits after his trip to Ireland; had a wonderful day yesterday with the people of Ireland and very much enjoyed himself in getting to know some of his distant relatives and the broader Irish public.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, of course, we had a series of events with the Queen and the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 I think in general, as you saw the President reaffirm in an op-ed with Prime Minister Cameron this morning, the U.S.-U.K. relationship is both essential for our countries and for the world.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of this visit is to reaffirm that relationship, to further align our approaches on all the core issues that we work with the United Kingdom on.\xc2\xa0 And that runs the gamut from our cooperation on global economic recovery to the effort in Afghanistan, counterterrorism, our efforts in Libya, our nonproliferation agenda, and a whole host of issues that the Prime Minister and the President will have the opportunity to discuss tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think also the President was very honored to be received by the Queen today.\xc2\xa0 She, of course, is a historic figure who in many ways embodies the depth of the ties between our two nations, dating back, of course, to our shared effort in World War II and throughout the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 And again I think her receiving the President was a deep honor for both him and the First Lady and, again, underscores the friendship between our two countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President then, of course, was able to visit with Prime Minister Cameron and to visit a local school in town.\xc2\xa0 The President and Prime Minister Cameron both very much wanted to have the opportunity, within the context of the formal state visit, to get out and interact with some young people, and they were able to do so at the Global Academy.\xc2\xa0 And again I think it spoke to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to, again, interact with some of the British people during his time here, in addition to his official business.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of scheduling things to run through.\xc2\xa0 Tonight of course is the dinner at Buckingham Palace.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow the President will have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 I went through some of the subjects that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that they\xe2\x80\x99ll drop by a barbeque that\'s being hosted by the First Lady and Prime Minister Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s wife to celebrate military families, and this will have service members from the United States who are based in the U.K., as well as of course British service members.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be announcing a new joint initiative focused on military families and care for our veterans.\xc2\xa0 This of course has been a focus for the First Lady of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a focus for Prime Minister Cameron and his wife here.\xc2\xa0 And this will establish a new service personnel task force that will share best practices on how we can better provide support for military personnel and their families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That includes linking them up in their communities to meet their needs.\xc2\xa0 That includes supporting the transition of those who are leaving service into civilian life through vocational training and education.\xc2\xa0 It includes support for wounded warriors and other ill and injured personnel, including the physical and psychological care and rehabilitation that they need.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it speaks to the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re coming through a period of time where we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, of course, nearly 10 years of conflict. So many of the same challenges that we have in the United States associated with wounded warriors and military families are present here in the U.K.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what this task force will do is bring together experts from both countries on a regular basis, seek the use and involvement of charitable organizations and the private sector, and bring together, again, government officials who can on a regular basis share those best practices and help strengthen our efforts to support service members and their families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So after that event, the President and Prime Minister will hold a joint press conference.\xc2\xa0 Then the President will address the British Parliament.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s an honor that he\xe2\x80\x99s very deeply moved to receive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a few things about the speech, and you may have questions on it.\xc2\xa0 I think what he\xe2\x80\x99ll again underscore is both the essential nature of the U.S.-U.K. alliance as well as the broader transatlantic alliance to global security and prosperity.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously come through a very difficult decade, but in some respects we\xe2\x80\x99re turning a corner insofar as we\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully ended our combat mission in Iraq, removed 100,000 troops.\xc2\xa0 The British forces of course have left Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts to dismantle, defeat -- disrupt and defeat al Qaeda have weakened that organization, of course including the killing of Osama bin Laden recently.\xc2\xa0 We are preparing to begin a transition -- or have already begun a transition in Afghanistan to Afghan lead that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to undertake over the course of the next -- until 2014.\xc2\xa0 And of course we are working very hard every day to advance a global economic recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that context, of course we recognize that we live in a new world that\xe2\x80\x99s quite different from the one that we faced after World War II or the end of the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 You have of course rising powers around the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think what the President will reaffirm, though, is that even in that changing context, that it is the alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom and the broader transatlantic alliance that is the cornerstone of global security and the extension of the democratic values that we share.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States and the United Kingdom, along with our allies, are the ones who shoulder particular burdens for global security.\xc2\xa0 We see that in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We see that in our efforts against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 We see that of course today in Libya. We are deeply invested in an international system that marshals collective action and that can be applied of course to not just our efforts in Afghanistan but our efforts around nonproliferation, the ongoing effort to enforce sanctions on nations like Iran and North Korea that are not meeting their obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We see that, of course, in our efforts to promote development around the world, to combat disease together.\xc2\xa0 But above all, we see that in a set of values that we share, democratic values.\xc2\xa0 And again, at a time when we see people in the Middle East and North Africa in particular reaching for those democratic values, it underscores that the things that we believe in are not just relevant but essential to the development of greater prosperity and security and democracy for peoples around the world.\xc2\xa0 So he\'ll speak about steps that we can take to support universal rights in the Middle East and North Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a brief preview.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be a broad lay of the land about, again, our economic efforts, our efforts on behalf of global security and our values, as well as what it is exactly that binds the U.S. and UK together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that, of course, the President will then, later on that night, host a dinner for the Queen to reciprocate for her hospitality.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only other thing that I\'d mention at the top of this is, as you know I think, the President signed an executive order associated with our Iran sanctions efforts last night, and today there\xe2\x80\x99s an announcement of the designation of a number of additional companies in the nonproliferation and energy sectors associated with our Iran sanctions effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis continues to reenforce the message that we\'ve sent, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a cost to doing business with Iran, that Iran is increasingly isolated and paying a price for its illicit nuclear program, and it, frankly, comes on the heels of a very robust set of European Union sanctions that were announced in recent days, I think which further underscores the point that the U.S. and Europe are working in concert to advance the agenda of nonproliferation and the agenda of peace and security more broadly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the discussion tomorrow between Cameron and Obama on Libya.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the talk that we hear now is sort of forward-looking, what happens after Qaddafi leaves power.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s still there, he\xe2\x80\x99s still in power.\xc2\xa0 So what is the discussion going to focus on in terms of the next steps in the NATO mission?\xc2\xa0 And then also, there are some British politicians that have criticized the U.S. and asked for more U.S. involvement in the NATO mission.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the U.S. is open to, or is what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now the extent of what we are going to do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 Libya will certainly be one of the lead agenda items tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the current context, which is that I think we believe that the trends show that time is very much working against Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 Since we began the operation just over two months ago, we\xe2\x80\x99ve significantly degraded his forces.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve enabled the enforcement of a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 And not only have we stopped his advance on major population centers like Benghazi where there could have been a massacre, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen the opposition take the time and space that it needs to organize to push Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces back from Misurata, to push them back not just from Benghazi but Ajdabiya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that Qaddafi and his forces are under tremendous strain.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw today there were additional targeting in Tripoli at command and control centers, all of which I think sends a message that the trend lines are against Qaddafi, that time is working against him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think tomorrow in their discussions they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about, again, the need to sustain that kind of pressure through the NATO mission, along with our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll also talk about ways that we can support the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We recently have received in Washington members of the council who we believe are a credible interlocutor, a legitimate interlocutor of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 We\'re providing assistance to them, non-lethal assistance, in line with a number of other nations.\xc2\xa0 And so one of the things that we can do over time is, again, build their capacity to deliver on behalf of the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the international alignment and the international effort that\'s necessary to support Libya, not just through our military action but the political and diplomatic support, as well.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a contact group that\'s met several times to discuss both the military effort that\'s ongoing but also the humanitarian assistance that can be provided, the political support for the opposition in Libya, and ultimately what kind of transition could take place in Libya when Qaddafi is no longer in power.\xc2\xa0 And in that effort the council has made a number of positive statements about moving towards a democratic and inclusive Libya.\xc2\xa0 So I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on your second question, I think the United States provided enormous amount of resources on the front end of the military effort to stop Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces in their tracks and to degrade his capability so a no-fly zone can be more easily enforced.\xc2\xa0 We already said that we will then transition to a NATO command and that our partners would take on a lot of the responsibility for the no-fly zone and striking targets on the ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to provide a range of assistance to that effort -- logistical support, intelligence support, targeting support, a jamming of Libyan communications.\xc2\xa0 And in addition to that, we identified a unique capability that we thought could help with the effort, which was the ability to target -- to hit targets with an unmanned aerial vehicle, for instance, which allows for precision targeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, we also think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at the broad picture.\xc2\xa0 You have the striking of targets on the ground, but you also have the need to enforce an arms embargo, to enforce sanctions, and so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at ways to both do that and to get more resources to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s an ongoing effort on the Hill right now to look at how we might be able to vest some of the funds from the money that we seized from Qaddafi and the opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a lot of ways that the U.S. is contributing diplomatically through support to the opposition and through support to the military effort.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so and that that is playing an incredibly important role in the operation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is considering sending attack helicopters to Libya. Is this something that you support?\xc2\xa0 And is it a sign that the war is dragging on sort of indecisively?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign because as I said, in just two months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not only accomplished the initial objective, which was stopping a massacre in Benghazi and putting in place a no-fly zone, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all of the trends running against Qaddafi, again, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposition taking control of Misurata and Ajdabiya, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s his being cut off from the cash and arms that he needs to resupply, and the degradation of his forces.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s, again, a steady erosion of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s ability to endanger his own citizens that we believe demonstrates that time is going to work against him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the helicopters, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said at the outset is that there\'s an international effort under NATO command, along with Arab participation -- which is, again, unique in the history of NATO to have Arab participation under a NATO-led effort -- each nation will make individual decisions about the nature of its contributions.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve had nations, for instance, that have flown missions and hit targets on the ground. You have nations who have enforced a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 You have nations who are providing more support from more a logistical nature.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we welcome the contributions of every member of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 So this additional contribution by the British, of course, is an important effort to strengthen the capability of the coalition, and we certainly welcome it.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s in line with how the operation was set up, which is that you have a unified NATO command and then you have coalition members who make their own determinations about their contributions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, but how can the U.S. continue to support the war without having Congress -- now that 60 days have expired late last week -- how can you continue to participate in a war without Congress approving a resolution to say the U.S. can still participate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think we addressed that through the letter the President sent up to Congress at the end of last week, again, reaffirming our ongoing efforts in Libya and expressing support for a resolution that is currently being worked in the Senate by a number of senators including, for instance, Senator McCain, Senator Kerry and others.\xc2\xa0 So we believe we have the authorities we need.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe we have the obligation to continue to consult with Congress on this issue, and we, again, expressed our support for the resolution that is being worked in the Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Congress\xe2\x80\x99s support why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you get it before the 60 days expired?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand, if you continue to do it, if you don\'t have the approval you say you\'re going to seek --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to whether and when they take up a resolution.\xc2\xa0 So, again, that\'s -- Congress will determine the timing of when it might consider a resolution.\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve done is consistently consult with Congress through testimony and other means, and again, in the letter from the President we\'ve expressed support for the particular resolution that was brought to our attention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The letter in which the resolution is mentioned suggests that the role is limited, the U.S. role is limited so that congressional authorization is not needed.\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting to hear from the French in the next stop and also tomorrow with Prime Minister Cameron a much harder sell for the U.S. to increase the mission back to providing the unique capabilities that the President talked about two months ago?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President, before the operation began, spoke to both President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Cameron that the nature of that commitment would be limited in scope and duration and that we would hand over command from the United States to NATO, and that we would similarly hand over responsibility for the enforcement of the civilian protection mission and no-fly zone to our partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was the understanding from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said since then is that we -- again, we would consult with NATO, consider requests, but that the nature of our commitment was always going to be limited in scope and duration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say, however, that the contributions we\xe2\x80\x99re making now are very significant to the mission.\xc2\xa0 We do have a unique capability, for instance around our intelligence, around our refueling capacity, around our ability to jam Libyan command and control, for instance.\xc2\xa0 So the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in support of the mission continue to be very important to its success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, we believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s totally in line with the understandings that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with our allies throughout this effort.\xc2\xa0 And what these conversations are, are an opportunity to continue to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re aligned, to continue to make sure that there is broad support for the mission, and to continue to talk through some of these other issues, which are very important, around how do we get support to the opposition, how do we make sure that the international community is preparing to support perhaps a transition to a post-Qaddafi Libya.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of issues associated with Libya that the leaders will be discussing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the alliance being a catalyst for global action.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- is it credible that Europe, given its declining defense budgets and declining in relative power throughout the areas of the world, can play the role the United States would like it to play?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think, in the first instance, it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that the U.S. and Europe continue to serve as that catalyst for global action.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk about other emerging powers, and that talk leads to questions as to whether or not the United States and Europe are going to continue to play the role in the world that they have for several decades as world leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think if you look at it, there is no other alliance that assumes the burdens that we assume on behalf of peace and security, and that, again, invests as much as we do in enforcement of international law and in global development.\xc2\xa0 And I think the message to Europe -- and, frankly, in answer to your question, I think we\'ve been very pleased with the contributions, just to take the security side of things, that we\'ve seen out of our European allies to the mission in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had a dramatic increase in resources after a period of under-resourcing over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 And I think Libya also speaks to the fact that our European allies are accepting a burden on behalf of the enforcement of U.N. Security Council resolutions and in terms of trying to, again, not just stop a massacre but give the Libyan people an opportunity to determine their future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So our focus is on maintaining the role that the U.S. and Europe play together as a catalyst for action and we believe that in the emerging context of the 21st century, not only is that as relevant as ever, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to demand contributions from all nations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to take one example, in that respect, at Lisbon, NATO agreed on a new strategic concept where different nations would develop different capabilities that could be brought to bear so that NATO is no longer an alliance built to simply repel a Soviet invasion but can meet new threats, whether they come from ballistic missiles or cyber attacks or terrorism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all of us, frankly, need to be reorienting our capabilities, and we\'re confident that that\'s already taking place through efforts such as NATO\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of the new strategic concept.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have concerns as Europe, and the UK in particular, grapples with the global economic recovery and makes cuts, that that, in the words of former Under Secretary of State Nick Burns, makes them perhaps a less capable military partner?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s talk of mothballing the aircraft carrier -- the one aircraft carrier of -- mothballing their Harrier fleets. Given the essential nature of the relationship, do you have concern that the economic recovery would make them a less capable partner?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think all nations, of course, are focused on their economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly true in the United States and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true here.\xc2\xa0 We also know that a lot of nations are looking at ways to reduce spending.\xc2\xa0 The United States is looking at a range of ways, including in our defense budget.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that we can pursue that effort in a way that\'s entirely consistent with our security needs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s part of the reason why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to focus on developing the capabilities that are going to be necessary to the threats that we face, and they\xe2\x80\x99re -- because they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed. Part of what you have is nations whose models of defense spending and habits of defense spending over a period of time, again, were focused on 20th century challenges.\xc2\xa0 And now what we see is we\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to be faced with threats from very different places, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missiles or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s piracy on the high seas, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s cyber.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we want is the alliance to be able to modernize and to make sure that the investments that we\xe2\x80\x99re using are smart and are focused in the right place, and that we do that on a coordinated basis.\xc2\xa0 Because what NATO provides is it provides a framework for countries to make decisions so that their spending and their investments are amplified because there are different capabilities that are going to be invested in different places against the challenges that we see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we think -- we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that Europe can continue to play the role it\xe2\x80\x99s played as our principal and fundamental security partner in the world, even as, of course, we have a number of very critical security relationships ranging from obviously our Asian allies to Australia to other countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Iran sanctions thing, if you could elaborate on the unique aspects of that -- is there a message in this for the government of Venezuela?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a message to the government of Iran that there is going to be an increasing cost to its failure to live up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said from the beginning of our time in office was if Iran couldn\xe2\x80\x99t demonstrate the peaceful nature of its program, we were going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to increasingly ramp up the pressure that they face.\xc2\xa0 The Security Council resolution provided a baseline for that.\xc2\xa0 The national actions that we passed through our Congress provide a baseline for that.\xc2\xa0 And the authorities of previous sanctions, laws, provide a basis for that.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done since June of last year is steadily ramp up the pressure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right to identify the fact that the energy sector is one that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a message to Iran that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to target those places where we believe, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s in violation of its obligations, and where there will be a cost imposed upon them for their actions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the message to the Iranian government is, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be stepping up the pressure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pause.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to let up.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be continually looking for ways to tighten the screws.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the companies involved, there is a very clear message that there is a cost to doing business with Iran; that essentially there\xe2\x80\x99s a choice in many respects between doing business with us and doing business with Iran, and so that therefore we\xe2\x80\x99re going to disincentivize those companies that engage in business with Iran.\xc2\xa0 And what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the course of the last year is a number of major companies make their own determinations that they would rather stop doing business with Iran than continue to do so in the current climate where they\xe2\x80\x99re facing these sanctions and they\xe2\x80\x99re under these pressures.\xc2\xa0 So that expands across the board to everybody that we\xe2\x80\x99ve sanctioned, including the company you mentioned.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, so you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the message is more for the business community as opposed to, in Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s case, the government itself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s everybody who does business with Iran.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a safe -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not the right place to be investing; that the international community has a program of sanctions and that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be tightening those sanctions; and that business is better off done elsewhere. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of the isolation that Iran is going to face and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of the costs that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to face if they don\'t meet their obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the Eurozone debt issues, how much did that play into the conversations the President had yesterday, played into today -- Jay, this may be for you -- and does the President think that while he\xe2\x80\x99s here, that the Euro debt problems are, at the very least for the short term, contained?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That our debt problems are contained?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, the Eurozone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we both can take this, but that is part of the discussions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously economic issues are on the table for the meetings both here and at the G8.\xc2\xa0 And we monitor what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Europe very closely, as you know, as we have since we came to office.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize the efforts that are being made one way or the other, but we obviously are discussing with them the need to get debts under control, get deficits under control, just like we\xe2\x80\x99re endeavoring to do in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just add that from the -- throughout these issues, President Obama, Secretary Geithner and others consult regularly with their European counterparts on this.\xc2\xa0 We of course did throughout this situation in Greece last year.\xc2\xa0 So I fully expect that as a part of our global economic recovery agenda they\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing these issues in the coming days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, so in a speech before this joint meeting of Congress, Prime Minister Netanyahu referred to Hamas as the Palestinian version of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. government share that assessment?\xc2\xa0 And if not, is this rhetoric that helps the peace process or not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the U.S. very clearly believes that Hamas is a terrorist organization; that until it ceases its use of terrorism and recognizes Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist, that they can\xe2\x80\x99t be a credible partner for peace.\xc2\xa0 The President made that very clear in his speech on Thursday, that the Palestinian leadership is going to have to provide some credible answers to Israel about how it can be a partner for peace, and that those answers are going to have to include of course recognizing its right to exist.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we do share an assessment and have for some time that Hamas is a terrorist organization --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, those are Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xc2\xa0 The comparison that\xe2\x80\x99s fair is that Hamas has in the past indiscriminately targeted innocent women and children and men through the firing of rockets or through bombs on buses.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly -- they certainly share the characteristics of a terrorist organization that has indiscriminately taken civilian life.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any overall response to the speech?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed the strength of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.\xc2\xa0 He laid out his deep concerns about Iran, which we certainly share, and again have taken additional action in the last couple of days around our sanctions effort, and again pointed to the importance of peace.\xc2\xa0 We had -- again, the message he delivered to Congress I think is very similar to the discussions he had with the President and the speech he gave last night.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do is reaffirm our shared goal, which he -- the Prime Minister referenced today, that a two-state solution is in the interests of all the parties and that we have to redouble our efforts to pursue that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more quick question.\xc2\xa0 It looks like the Senate is not going to vote on that resolution on Libya before the Memorial Day recess.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House disappointed in that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, these determinations are up to Congress, so we defer to them on what they decide to take up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you like to see it before Memorial Day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing with regard to the resolution.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed our support for the resolution and its Congress\xe2\x80\x99s determination about when to have that kind of vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, does the President view the formula he laid out last week about \xe2\x80\x9967 borders with swaps as a disincentive for Europeans that are thinking about whether to support a Palestinian drive for statehood?\xc2\xa0 Does he think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good counterargument to say stick with the process, don\xe2\x80\x99t allow this snowball to roll down the hill?\xc2\xa0 And if so, has he begun articulating that to Prime Minister Cameron?\xc2\xa0 Do you think he will tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a number of things, Mark.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that statehood can be achieved through the United Nations; that any kind of unilateral effort to pursue statehood is not going to succeed because ultimately these issues have to be negotiated and agreed upon between Israelis and Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s been very clear with respect to prospective efforts in September in the fact that they won\xe2\x80\x99t achieve the ultimate goal, which is of course a Palestinian state next to a secure Israel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important, however, to make sure that there is a credible alternative to those efforts.\xc2\xa0 And again, we believe that that alternative needs to be negotiations between the parties.\xc2\xa0 And what the President was doing on Thursday and then reiterating in his AIPAC speech over the weekend is that we believe that there can be a more successful foundation for those negotiations if we begin with discussions on the basis of -- on security and territory, on the basis of 1967 lines with mutually agreed upon swaps for territory, and the assurances that are necessary around Israeli security; that by starting there -- around a set of ideas, by the way, that have been discussed at length over the course of the last decade or more among the parties -- you can show that there\xe2\x80\x99s a foundation for progress that didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously exist in the public realm, and that that, again, is a credible alternative to efforts that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think can and will succeed, such as the pursuit of unilateral -- some kind of unilateral effort to pursue statehood, whether at the United Nations or in other places.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it will certainly be a topic of discussion tomorrow and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure with other leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- either the Prime Minister or other European leaders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- absolutely, because there was a very strong statement from the Quartet the day after the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, welcoming it, expressing strong support for what he laid out as a basis for negotiation.\xc2\xa0 So we had a very good response from our European allies the day after the speech.\xc2\xa0 And I think the -- certainly the President and Prime Minister made reference to it in their op-ed this morning, and we expect that -- again, we want to marshal international support for negotiations and for the basis of negotiations that the President laid out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the goals of the national security task force that you guys are forming?\xc2\xa0 And are there going to be other sorts of things like that that the U.K. and the U.S. announce tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since we came into office is that on the core issues that are focused on every day at the National Security Council, on just about every single one the United Kingdom is a partner with us, and that that requires very close coordination -- when you talk about implementing a transition in Afghanistan, when you talk about our counterterrorism efforts, when you talk about the nonproliferation agenda that I discussed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so in order to better enable that coordination, we have decided to formalize the process by which we consult and coordinate with the U.K. so that you have regular established contacts between the senior members of our team and our senior British counterparts so that our approaches are aligned, so that we can share ideas and information, and so that we can speak about what efforts we might carry back to other countries, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an effort to formalize consultation to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s on a regular basis, to make sure that the lines of communication are constantly open between us.\xc2\xa0 It speaks to the uniqueness of the relationship that we have with the United Kingdom that we would coordinate with them at this level.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And these types of mechanisms prove quite useful.\xc2\xa0 For instance, we have a separate one with our quad partners -- Germany, France, the U.K. and the United States -- where Tom Donilon regularly has a secure videoconference with his national security advisor counterparts.\xc2\xa0 And of course, the President speaks on a fairly regular basis with each of those three in a quad setting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a signal of the depth of the relationship, and it will allow us to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re totally synched up as we deal with some very big pieces of business in the next year or two.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there other things like that -- some other initiatives that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, the military families one that I spoke to is a manifestation of that.\xc2\xa0 There will be a designated lead official from both of our governments, again, to meet on a regular basis to marshal private sector and charitable support for military families and wounded warriors.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing we do in different sectors.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to pursue that in the economic and security realm.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll just do a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s hope, is it the delegation\xe2\x80\x99s hope, that you will come out of tomorrow and the G8 with something on Libya that will sort of show that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to end this sooner rather than later, and that everyone is going to put in more of an effort than they have, or various parties are going to put in more of an effort than they have so far?\xc2\xa0 And if that\'s the case, how would that correspond to the Security Council resolution?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen already a very robust pace of targeting and operations in recent says, including in Tripoli -- command and control targets.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that sends a very clear message that the pressure is not going to relent, that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to increase.\xc2\xa0 And I think we want to underscore to Qaddafi that the foot is not going to come off the gas pedal in terms of the decisions he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to make because NATO is going to continue our efforts.\xc2\xa0 With the passage of time, the opposition has more time and space.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a set of messages, all of which convey to Qaddafi that leaving is in his best interests and the best interests of the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, around the military effort, the civilian support for opposition and the international community\xe2\x80\x99s support for Libya\xe2\x80\x99s future -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely in line with the U.N. Security Council resolution -- all the targets we\xe2\x80\x99re doing are in line with the mission of civilian protection and taking all necessary measures to achieve that goal -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s striking targets on the ground, disabling their assets, or disabling command and control targets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI should just add, just since you mentioned the G8, it is important I think to underscore how much the Middle East and North Africa and the democratic transitions there will be an agenda item both tomorrow and at the G8.\xc2\xa0 One of the I think big topics of discussion that the President and Prime Minister will have tomorrow is the change in the region, the support we can provide to Egypt and Tunisia, for instance, as potential democratic models, as they go through their transitions, and then that will be reaffirmed at the G8.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with our G8 partners and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with us about precisely the kinds of ideas the President referenced in his speech around international support, around some of the reorientation of institutional support to the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 So I think both in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meetings and Deauville, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see Egypt and Tunisia as a topic of conversation, and the region more generally.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Scott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Some Europeans have said they\'re not inclined to support the statehood resolution -- Palestinian statehood resolution, but if no peace process has begun by September, they\xe2\x80\x99d have a hard time telling Palestinian leadership that they won\xe2\x80\x99t support it.\xc2\xa0 Would the President reconsider his position if no peace process has begun by September?\xc2\xa0 And what will his response to that be in the meetings with some of these leaders in the next couple days?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly don\'t believe that the U.N. is the appropriate forum for achieving Palestinian statehood.\xc2\xa0 So that is the U.S. position and will continue to be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think one of the things that\'s important, though, around a peace process is, first of all, you have to make sure you have a credible partner on both sides.\xc2\xa0 And I think our European allies have, of course, similar questions about the best way to get the process going.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that getting the process going is going to require a credible answer from the Palestinians about the role that Hamas is going to play in the new government, and whether a Palestinian partner and interlocutor can credibly say it recognizes Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist and is not committed to engaging in terrorism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in the first instance, there is some -- again, some step that needs to be taken on the Palestinian side, again, to give Israel that confidence coming into the negotiation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in the second instance, we do believe, though, to catalyze the process and to, again, give an affirmation that we believe it can succeed.\xc2\xa0 It was our position that putting out U.S. principles, U.S. positions on the fundamental issues of territory and security provide that basis for negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So, again, all of that is a part of investing in a credible alternative to what we believe are efforts that won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in resolving the conflict.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to let Ben go.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll just take one more for Ben if you want.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with markets down in Europe, is the economy going to become an even bigger part of the discussions?\xc2\xa0 It seemed like North Africa and the Middle East were going to be the central theme last week in the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Is the economy going to become a bigger part?\xc2\xa0 And then also, is the President going to express support for Britain\xe2\x80\x99s austerity measures at the Parliament tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think the economy is always an issue on the agenda, and we\xe2\x80\x99re always consulting about the respective situations in the Eurozone and the United States that we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned, frankly, through the G20 process that coordinating our efforts is essential to sustaining a global recovery.\xc2\xa0 So I think the economy will be certainly a first order of business along with a pretty broad peace and security agenda -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, Libya, Afghanistan, Iran and other issues as well as of course the Arab Spring -- so I think the economy looked at in that context.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the austerity plan, I think what we see is that both of our nations have a strong commitment to sustaining a strong economic recovery and a strong commitment to reducing deficits, and that\'s the position of the U.S. government, that\'s the position of the British government.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is staking out the goals that we\xe2\x80\x99re both trying to achieve, which is a global economy that is able to have balanced and sustainable growth.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President will talk about it in that broader context of the place that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get to both as partners but also as a global effort through the G20 and other measures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a lot farther than the President is willing to go and the U.S., as far as their austerity measures?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, every country pursues these challenges based upon their own decisions.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- I may defer to Jay here -- the President has laid out his approach to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 So has Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 We share a goal within each of our countries of reducing our deficits.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very confident in our approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, in the global context, we believe that we need to focus our efforts, and ensuring that the economic recovery, that it\xe2\x80\x99s balanced.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the nature of our discussions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wrap it up.\xc2\xa0 Ben is going to have to go.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take Ann.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President expressed any frustration he\xe2\x80\x99s so far away from home during the destructive storms in Missouri and other locations?\xc2\xa0 Another storm front coming through there tonight -- any discussion of him possibly going home early?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any scheduling updates for you, Ann.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is very concerned, as he noted this morning and expressed this morning, about the devastating damage caused by these terrible tornadoes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has spoken twice now with Governor Nixon.\xc2\xa0 He has spoken with the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, as well as his deputy, and is being updated regularly about the situation on the ground there, and, as you know, announced this morning that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling to Missouri on Sunday to view the damage, consult with officials there on the response and recovery efforts, as well as meet with families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concern about the ash cloud maybe complicating any of his travels here in Europe later in the week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring that.\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\'t have any scheduling announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 We remain on schedule, as planned.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously apprise you if anything changes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just take one more.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to go, too.\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- in honor of our special, essential relationship --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his speech tomorrow, will the President go any further than he did on Thursday on the economic assistance that the U.S. and the U.K. and allies together could offer to Egypt, Tunisia and other struggling democracies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And separately, on defense, will there be any specific message from the President to the Prime Minister about where the U.S. thinks British defense spending levels should be?\xc2\xa0 There have been some fairly specific suggestions from the Pentagon to parliamentary delegations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of echoing any of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the discussions he might have.\xc2\xa0 Ben answered a question related to military spending and how we view that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously think that the alliance has proven itself to be vital for many years, and continues to be in the future of meeting the challenges that we face together.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any more than the rather robust preview of the speech that Ben gave to provide for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier Ben made a reference to a rising new world power or powers of interests or concerns, so to speak, that the U.S. and U.K. alliance would be -- would he be alluding to China? Or what exactly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember the language he used.\xc2\xa0 I think the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- new world nations --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, I remember, I heard that part.\xc2\xa0 I think he was talking about the durability and significance of this alliance, even as the world has changed, obviously, with the rise of new powers around the globe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily threaten the alliance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that and neither would I.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n</p><p>END<br/>6:58 P.M.
