EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here as we make our way to Cleveland, Ohio, and onward from there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President is giving a campaign speech about the economy and about the debate over our economic future.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ll ask, but don\'t expect me to preview in any detail that speech because I want you to hear it from the President himself.\xc2\xa0 He looks very much forward to making this presentation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the speech has sort of been framed by the campaign as a chance for Obama to lay out his vision on the economy and draw a contrast with Romney\'s vision.\xc2\xa0 But does the President really think that at this point, after more than three years in office, that the public doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or know already what his vision on the economy is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President does believe\xc2\xa0 -- I know the President does believe that the American people understand his overall vision of what we need to do to continue to move the economy forward.\xc2\xa0 But what elections are about is, in this case, a choice on the dominant issue of the day, and that is what should we do, what is the right plan, what is the right vision for having the economy grow and create more jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two candidates here are in agreement on that issue that this is the number-one focus of the American people and will be the issue around which the election will be decided.\xc2\xa0 And what I have said, and the President certainly has for some time now, is that we need to grow the economy by investing in the foundations of a 21st century economy that would be built to last.\xc2\xa0 And that includes investments in education, in innovation, infrastructure, in energy and elsewhere -- not to adopt a proposal or a vision that essentially says we\'re going to do exactly what we did in the first decade of this century, only more so, even though we know what the results of that approach were -- an approach that said let\'s let Wall Street write its own rules; let\'s let insurance companies write their own rules; let\'s give huge tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest people in the country and hope that that trickles down to have a positive economic impact; let\'s cut investments dramatically in education and innovation and infrastructure and energy, and cross our fingers that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t adversely affect our potential for economic growth in the 21st century when, in fact, we know it will do just that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve tried that.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 Overwhelmingly, Americans share the view that it did not work.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this debate will be about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two speechwriters on the plane today.\xc2\xa0 Are there last-minute changes going on with the speech?\xc2\xa0 And anything new in the speech?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve been told that there is probably nothing\xc2\xa0 -- no new proposals.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A couple things on that.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, always works on his speeches and this is no different -- continues to refine them.\xc2\xa0 The second point is -- I\'ve addressed this.\xc2\xa0 We have had a lot of debate and discussion about what the right policy choices should be for our economy over these last three years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a number of proposals out there about what we should do.\xc2\xa0 There is the Ryan budget, which Governor Romney has embraced wholly, has said is "marvelous."\xc2\xa0 There are Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s own proposals for an additional $5 trillion tax cut.\xc2\xa0 There are the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals, which include a balanced deficit reduction plan that would reduce our deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, as well as his proposals for near-term economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the Speaker of the House offered an opinion today, prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, where he made yet again the claim that the numerous bills that the House Republicans have passed that they call jobs proposals are what the economy needs right now, ignoring the fact -- and you guys can do this -- do not take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 Ask economists to assess those plans.\xc2\xa0 Ask them if they would have any positive effect on the economy right now.\xc2\xa0 Ask them if they would create jobs right now.\xc2\xa0 And the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not accurate to suggest they would.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why it was a fantastic piece a number of months ago when they were making this argument, when they were arguing about how we needed to -- against the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal -- we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans because it would hurt small businesses -- and you know their refrain about small businesses -- when, in fact, the small businesses that pay income tax rates at the highest level are hedge fund managers and corporate law firms.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they could not -- the reporter went from office to office among House Republican leaders and not one of them could come up and name a small business that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hedge fund manager or law partner or something like that who would be affected by that change in the tax code.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the level.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the outside economists have said about the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals that have not yet been passed -- or have been blocked by the Republicans in Congress, is that they would create jobs now; they would spur economic growth now.\xc2\xa0 So if the debate is, what can we do to help the economy now, the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals are clearly a better answer than what the Republicans have put forward thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been almost a week now since the President, again, called on Congress to take these steps.\xc2\xa0 Not really any movement. What\xe2\x80\x99s the carrot; what\xe2\x80\x99s the stick?\xc2\xa0 I mean, as we go forward, does he just keep saying -- calling again on Congress to do something?\xc2\xa0 Or is there something he can do between now and the election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President address that issue.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there is no question that there is gridlock in Washington.\xc2\xa0 There is no question the Republicans have decided, by and large, that their preferred path is to do nothing, to sit on their hands, and hope that the fact that the United States is still recovering from the worst recession in our lifetimes, hoping that because there are still far too many Americans out of work and growth is not where it should be, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll squeak out a victory in the fall election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the people who pay the price for that approach are middle-class Americans who are struggling right now in the economy.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong approach.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very confident the American people want an end to this kind of gridlock and stalemate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this election, I think, will be focused on this debate about what our economic future should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s simply appalling to accept the idea that Republicans simply refuse to take action on things that can help our economy grow right now and help it create jobs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you speak to the juxtaposition --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before I get to that -- because I know Michael here has probably read it, somebody of you may also -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a Robert Draper book about the House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s worth a read.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a great scene in the beginning of a dinner of Republican Senate and House Republican leaders I think on the night of the inauguration of the President.\xc2\xa0 So this is at time when, as you know, America was in unbelievable crisis.\xc2\xa0 The economic crisis was in full bloom.\xc2\xa0 The potential for a full-blown global meltdown was being discussed daily, and a new President had been sworn in.\xc2\xa0 This is a time when Americans expected their leaders in Washington to come together and figure out ways that they could cooperate to help stave off a depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the content of that discussion at dinner was, what can we do to defeat President Obama?\xc2\xa0 What can we do to oppose everything that he proposes?\xc2\xa0 And I think that tells you everything about the stalemate we have in Washington right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you speak to the contrast between this morning\xe2\x80\x99s -- or this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s economy speech in Ohio and the fundraisers in New York later today, which are more high-end and celebrity-focused?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there a way to reconcile that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how do you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 The President is campaigning for reelection.\xc2\xa0 It requires any candidate who would do so to raise money.\xc2\xa0 A simple fact not mentioned in your question is that by comparison to his opponent, the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign -- and I would refer you to the campaign itself -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve just read this in the press, they have the details -- relies overwhelmingly on small donations under $200.\xc2\xa0 The difference is staggering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that it is incumbent upon everyone who views this to recognize that fact.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that running for President is an expensive proposition and requires efforts by the candidate and the campaign to raise the money necessary.\xc2\xa0 But to answer your question about where is the support coming for these candidates -- I think a glance at the numbers will tell you everything you need to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is not so much where is the support coming from, but is it difficult -- are there two different messages that transmit from those two events?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has supporters among all income groups, and so he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly raising money, in this case, at least at one of the fundraisers, from those who are more affluent.\xc2\xa0 But, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign receives an overwhelming percentage of its donations from average Americans who are donating less than $200.\xc2\xa0 Compare and contrast that with the Romney campaign.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that I think the campaign is best suited to address.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what are the expectations for the bilateral in the G20 with Putin, given the circumstances this week with the back-and-forth on the attack helicopters in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President looks forward to his first bilateral with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 Our relationship with Russia has been since the President took office and changed our approach one where we cooperate in areas where we agree -- and there have been many of those, and that has been productive and useful for both countries -- and we are clear and transparent and frank about the areas where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 Syria has clearly been one of them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Syria will be among the topics that are discussed, but not the only topic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one quick logistics question on the speech.\xc2\xa0 Favreau is on the plane today -- did he and the White House speechwriting team write this speech, or did the campaign team write it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 Since I know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t write it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did a lot of it, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Russia really quickly.\xc2\xa0 Because of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Assad regime, is there any concern that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to join the WTO this summer?\xc2\xa0 That normalized trade relations with Russia are something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to come up at the G20?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support Russia\xe2\x80\x99s accession to the WTO and we support measures that need to be taken to help bring that about. I think your point further illustrates what -- more fully illustrates what I was just discussing, which is the fact that we have disagreements with Russia on some matters -- Syria being one of them right now -- does not mean that we cannot move forward with the Russians on areas where we agree or where we are able to see more eye-to-eye.\xc2\xa0 And on Syria, we are going to continue our conversations with the Russians about the need to abandon Assad, if you will, because he has so clearly written in stone what his legacy will be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why not give them an ultimatum then?\xc2\xa0 Why not say that they can\xe2\x80\x99t join the WTO if they continue --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re creating a connection here that I am not suggesting exists.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have very frank discussions with the Russians and will continue to have them about Syria and other issues.\xc2\xa0 And I know that other countries have those same discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to Sheldon Adelson\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that he could give up to $100 million?\xc2\xa0 And does it send -- or should it send a message to the President\xe2\x80\x99s more well-heeled supporters to get in the game?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into what supporters of the President should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 I think that your question could be asked to your colleague here who just asked about optics.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why the President believes that the Citizens United decision was -- created an enormous problem for our country with regards to the way our campaigns are financed.\xc2\xa0 And I think the story that you just mentioned is a perfect illustration of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, think about how many people are trying -- are placing their support behind a candidate by writing a $50 check or a $100 check, and think how they feel they\xe2\x80\x99ve been heard or that their support will matter when somebody is writing tens of millions of dollars in one check, or two checks.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d note that, since we\xe2\x80\x99re on the theme and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the economy and the comparing visions here, that Governor Romney is in Ohio today.\xc2\xa0 And I think that one fact I am sure of is that Ohioans understand very well that the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to save the American automobile industry, to take action to prevent Chrysler and General Motors from liquidating, has been of huge benefit to workers in Ohio and across the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that those who opposed that approach, who decreed or declared that Detroit should be allowed to go bankrupt, and that the major American automobile industry should potentially disappear, have a hard case to make when it comes to whose economic policies and which economic policies would best benefit the people of Ohio and the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
