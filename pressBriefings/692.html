Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:18 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I wanted to let you know that on Friday, the President will be joined by college students here at the White House for an event where he will call on Congress to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling on July 1st.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget includes a proposal to guarantee students a low rate in July.\xc2\xa0 Democrats in the House and Senate have also put forward solutions to achieve that goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>While we welcome that House Republicans have paid some attention to this issue this year, their proposal, unfortunately, does not meet the test.\xc2\xa0 It fails to lock in low rates for students while also eliminating a safeguard that provides middle-class families most in need with lower interest rates for student loans.\xc2\xa0 And it raises rates of students for deficit reduction instead of taking on closing loopholes and tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected.</p>\n<p>The President will call on Congress to pass a solution that truly helps keep college affordable for middle-class families and students, and he looks forward to working with them in the days ahead to get there.</p>\n<p>With that, the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Last week, the President spoke about greater transparency in its drone program.\xc2\xa0 And in that spirit, I want to ask whether you can confirm reports of a drone attack that killed a Pakistani Taliban leader today in Pakistan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 While we are not in the position to confirm the reports of Waliur Rehman\xe2\x80\x99s death, if those reports were true or prove to be true, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that his demise would deprive the TTP -- Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan -- of its second in command and chief military strategist.\xc2\xa0 Waliur Rehman has participated in cross-border attacks in Afghanistan against U.S. and NATO personnel and horrific attacks against Pakistani civilians and soldiers.\xc2\xa0 And he is wanted in connection to the murder of seven American citizens on December 30, 2009, at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>So while I am not in a position to confirm the reports of his death, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note who this individual is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not in a position to confirm because that\'s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have -- I\'m not in a position to confirm.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an ability to confirm that for you.\xc2\xa0 Separately, I\'m not in a position, also, to discuss operational matters, but it is important on this -- with regards to this individual, to know a little bit about his background.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you in the future then, if you have knowledge, would you be releasing this kind of information as part of this strategy that the President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that as part of this commitment to transparency, the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech at NDU laid out the legal and policy standards that guide our actions at great length, against whom and under what circumstances we take direct action.\xc2\xa0 Those standards are now there for the American public and the world to see.\xc2\xa0 That does not mean that we would be able to discuss the details of every counterterrorism operation, but it does mean that there are standards in place that are public and available for every American to review.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, let me also say that, to the extent that a question like this would be asking about our policy generally, I would refer you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in which he said that in the Afghan war theater we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 And that means we will continue to take strikes against high-value al Qaeda targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces.\xc2\xa0 By the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection and the progress we have made against core al Qaeda will reduce the need for unmanned strikes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at what the President said within the context of the Afghan war theater operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Reports today of some continuing rifts within the opposition -- some dispute between opposition in Syria and ex-patriot opposition.\xc2\xa0 Does that raise questions, one, about your support for those opposition movements; and two, about any prospects for a Geneva conference that would be successful?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First, I would say that it is not surprising that there might be disagreements within the opposition.\xc2\xa0 There is a unifying principle within the opposition, and that is that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future cannot include the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And we are working to bring together representatives of the opposition and the regime with the goal of implementing the Geneva Communique, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And the United Nations would chair the conference. Secretary Kerry has been meeting with other nations and a range of key supporters of the opposition to lay the groundwork for the conference.</p>\n<p>So we have been working with the opposition, together with our partners, to help them come together, to unify them around core principles.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the process towards implementation of the Geneva Communique continue. We think that, ultimately, the political transition in Syria that we seek and that the Syrian people seek is the right path to bring about a cessation of the terrible violence there and the beginning of an implementation of a post-Assad future for the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said yesterday that when the President meets with the Chinese President Xi Jinping next week, that cybersecurity would be a top item on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, in the face of what we read about as bold hacking attacks on U.S. companies and other U.S. entities, does the President bring any firm sort of discussion to that issue, offering the possibility that sanctions might be imposed on companies that indulge in hacking and that sort of thing?\xc2\xa0 What kind of an agenda will he bring to that discussion?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re correct that the President expects this to be a topic of conversation, one of many topics in his conversations with his Chinese counterpart.\xc2\xa0 This is a broad and complex relationship that we have, and there will be wide-ranging discussions on U.S.-China relations, on our economic and military cooperation, the efforts that we can undertake together to deal with global challenges as well as regional ones.</p>\n<p>But also, certainly, a topic of conversation will be North Korea; stability in Asia; expanding our bilateral military ties; climate change; and cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 And I think we have been clear in our concern about cybersecurity, our concern about the fact that there have been cyber intrusions emanating from China.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon, is just returning from a trip to China where he met and had discussion with Chinese officials from all levels and -- from the highest levels and representing a variety of responsibilities within the Chinese government.\xc2\xa0 And he raised our growing concerns with many senior Chinese officials on this matter and made clear that the United States will do all it must to protect our national networks, our critical infrastructure, and our valuable public and private sector property.</p>\n<p>And as Mr. Donilon noted earlier this year at the Asia Society, what we have been seeking from China is for it to investigate our concerns and to start a dialogue with us on cyber issues.\xc2\xa0 And we are pleased that China agreed last month to start a new working group along those lines, and through such a dialogue, we seek longer-term changes in China\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, including by working together to establish norms against the theft of trade secrets and confidential business information.</p>\n<p>But I want to reiterate -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it from the President and from senior members of his national security team\xc2\xa0 -- that this is a very high priority, the issue of cybersecurity. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in the way he\xe2\x80\x99s taken executive action.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in the way that we press for action by Congress for this. And the President considers this a very top priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent do those intrusions, which include intrusions in U.S. military information, undermine cooperation in the other areas that you cited just now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have an important and broad and complex relationship with China.\xc2\xa0 We are the two largest economies in the world, and we engage with the Chinese on an array of issues -- economic, political, cultural, military.\xc2\xa0 And this will be an important topic of what promises to be a broad conversation about a number of issues between the President and President Xi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other topic.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report of the U.S. giving instruction to the Pentagon to explore a no-fly zone in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can comment, as I have repeatedly, that every option available to the President remains on the table when it comes to our policy towards Syria.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, includes the possibility of a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it is inaccurate to suggest that somehow that option would be something that would be in development only now, because the President has made clear, and I and others have made clear, that he has asked that all options be available to him as he reviews those options and makes decisions about them.\xc2\xa0 So the suggestion that there\'s some new option when we have been discussing in this room, in response to suggestions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill and others, this particular option doesn\'t seem particularly newsworthy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has sent a letter to Eric Holder about his testimony to that committee on May 15th, during which the Attorney General said in regard to potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, this is "not something I\'ve ever been involved in, heard of, or would think would be wise policy."\xc2\xa0 Roughly a week after that, as you know, Jay, the Justice Department acknowledged that Attorney General Holder was involved in the decision to seek a search warrant for the private emails of James Rosen over at FOX News.\xc2\xa0 Is it the administration\'s opinion that the Attorney General testified truthfully at that hearing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think based on what you said, he testified truthfully.\xc2\xa0 I think every published report -- I think the Attorney General talked about prosecution.\xc2\xa0 Every published report that I\'ve read about the case in question says that it\'s completed, no further charges or prosecution is contemplated.\xc2\xa0 And again, I would point you to published reports on the extremely large distinction between what\'s at issue here and prosecution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the FBI affidavit identified Rosen as a potential "aider, abettor and/or co-conspirator."\xc2\xa0 That sounds very prosecutorial.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to published reports that say no prosecutorial action was taken and none is contemplated, again, based on my reading of reports.\xc2\xa0 So it seems self-evident that that charge is inaccurate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on May 16th, the President was asked whether he has confidence in the Attorney General and he answered in the affirmative.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the case?\xc2\xa0 Does he still have confidence in this Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 He absolutely does, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as for Syria and the no-fly zone, this talk that Russia might provide anti-aircraft weaponry to the Syrian government, should that be viewed as a potential move by the Russians to provide some kind of deterrent to a potential no-fly zone?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Russians have responded to questions about this.\xc2\xa0 I made clear yesterday in our gaggle on Air Force One our view of the continued supply of weaponry to the Syrians and we view it dimly.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\'s unhelpful and does not in any way contribute to the goal here, which is the reduction and elimination of the violence that\'s taking place in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And providing a tyrannical regime like the Assad regime with weapons is certainly not helpful to that cause.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to quickly follow up on the Eric Holder testimony, what he said in that May 15th testimony was with regard to the potential prosecution of a journalist.\xc2\xa0 Did he never sign off on --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I\'m looking for any evidence that there has been suggestion to the contrary.\xc2\xa0 What I have seen in published reports is that that case in question, as I understand it, again, based on publicly available information is completed, no further action is contemplated.\xc2\xa0 So hypotheticals to the contrary are one thing.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, what the Attorney General said is accurate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, no hypotheticals, and what that affidavit said was at the very least, Rosen was \xe2\x80\x9can aider, abettor and/or co-conspirator."\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how you would feel to have your name entered in an affidavit from the Justice Department --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- at the very least if you were an aider, an abettor or co-conspirator.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Be careful not to conflate facts with statements by members of Congress about what they want to be true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a legal document.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a statement.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but you\'re talking about this in relation to what the Congressman has said.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, I can only comment on this case based on the public reports and I can point you to what the published reports have said.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s been some pretty comprehensive reporting on this.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think you heard from the President his general concerns about -- again, general concerns, not specific to any cases -- about actions that might have a chilling effect on the ability of journalists to do their jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And for that reason, he has asked the Attorney General to meet with media organizations. He has asked the Attorney General to review policies and procedures that govern the way the Justice Department approaches these issues and to report back to him on that review.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s important to allow that process to be carried out, and also to note what the President said and made clear last week in terms of his views of this matter, his views of the balance and the essential proposition that journalists need to be able to operate and do their jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly his view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the national security speech, the President talked about the need for -- or his desire to have greater transparency of the drone program, and suggested that eventually this could be transferred over to be more of a military operation where there would be greater transparency.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you can give us an idea of what the timeline would be on this.\xc2\xa0 And do you feel -- it\'s got to be very unusual for you, because now we\'re in this kind of middle period where you\'re acknowledging that this program exists.\xc2\xa0 The previous administration didn\'t even do that.\xc2\xa0 But here you are today giving us the justification for a drone strike that happened in Pakistan without actually confirming that it happened.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I made clear that I think the extraordinary amount of information the President provided last week in a lengthy speech about our counterterrorism policies and other matters reflects his commitment to transparency on these issues.\xc2\xa0 It does not mean that we are going to discuss specific counterterror operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that going to change over time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that you have to look at what the President said last week about direct action and direct targeting, and also understand that, as he said, we have troops in harm\'s way in the Afghan war theater and that we need to take actions that are necessary to protect those troops, and that obviously as part of his policy with regards to the Afghan war, we are drawing down our troop presence there and we will be ending that war by the end of next year.\xc2\xa0 And that will then obviously change our disposition towards these matters with regards to the troops that we have present now.</p>\n<p>But I think it\'s important to note that the guidelines that he talked about and the programs that he talked about, I think that reflects his commitment to transparency, and the concerns he has about these issues and the need for a legal structure to be put in place that helps govern these counterterrorism operations. But it doesn\'t mean that it will be right or appropriate for us to talk about in detail specific counterterrorism operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just a follow up --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- were you giving justification?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was noting -- first of all, I cannot confirm reports that this individual is dead.\xc2\xa0 But I can say that what we know about him and what the world knows about him --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- qualify --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that his demise would deprive the TTP of its second in command and chief military strategist, someone who has participated in cross-border attacks against U.S. and NATO personnel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- either in theater or for his activities, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to be engaged in a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You gave that background for a reason.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So that people understand who this individual is.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to confirm reports of his death.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that he is -- this is the individual we\'re talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But under what the President said last week, both in theater and in activities he would qualify?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, as I just said, that in the Afghan war theater, we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s appraisal of Senator McCain\'s visit to meet with the Syrian rebels?\xc2\xa0 And have they had a conversation?\xc2\xa0 Just from the podium, would you give us a sense -- is this meddling?\xc2\xa0 Is this welcome?\xc2\xa0 Would you rather this not happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we said yesterday that we were aware of his trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- from the podium I want a sense --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were aware of his trip and we look forward to -- the President does -- discussing with Senator McCain his visit and his --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that on his schedule yet?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a scheduling update for you.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the President speaks or meets with Senator McCain with some regularity.\xc2\xa0 They met recently here in the White House. But I don\'t know that they have spoken yet since the Senator was in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We had a conversation last week where I asked you about the assessment that the Assad regime might be stronger.\xc2\xa0 You said you didn\'t know what the U.S. assessment of that is.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about the rebels.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration believe the rebels are winning, gaining ground, losing ground, less organized, more problematic?\xc2\xa0 What is its sense of the on-the-ground efforts to unseat the Assad regime?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that Assad remains in a vulnerable position, that his control over his country is extremely reduced because of the strength of the opposition.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously ebbs and flows in something like this.\xc2\xa0 And we have noted the role played by Iran in supporting Assad.\xc2\xa0 We have noted the role played by Hezbollah in supporting Assad, and have noted that that says a lot about the Assad regime in terms of the friends it has in the neighborhood and the world.</p>\n<p>We are committed with our partners and allies to a process that brings an end to this conflict and allows the Syrian people to determine their own future and they have determined that their future cannot include the Assad regime in power.\xc2\xa0 So I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s evident that there remains a great amount of violence in Syria, a great loss of life.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to give daily or weekly battlefield assessments.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that we are committed to our support for the Syrian people through humanitarian aid.\xc2\xa0 We are committed to our support for the Syria opposition through the direct assistance we\xe2\x80\x99ve been providing and will continue to provide.\xc2\xa0 And we are committed to reevaluating the options that are available to the President when it comes to further action in Syria, and we evaluate those options based on assessments of whether or not implementing those options would bring us closer to the policy objective, which is the peaceful transition within Syria that the Syrian people seek and that our partners and allies seek.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about today, is it your position he was technically accurate but not fully responsive?\xc2\xa0 Or accurate and fully responsive?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Justice Department for further details about what specifically the Attorney General was saying.\xc2\xa0 I think, based on published reports, it is my understanding that this case is complete and that no further prosecutorial action will be taken -- again, based on my reading of published reports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fair reading of questions from the member of Congress was is there anything in this world that you\xe2\x80\x99re personally responsible with, or overseeing, or have an active role in.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe the Attorney General was responsive on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was saying what the Attorney General said about his view on whether or not prosecution was an issue or is an issue.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply point you to what the Attorney General said, and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying based on the published reports that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, I see no conflict between what he said and the published reports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because obviously that came up in the testimony provided by officials representing the IRS, part of this administration.\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied, is this White House satisfied with the responsiveness of people it sends up to testify about matters of congressional interest?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a broad question, but the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s specific to this matter, the answer is yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, specifically even if the Attorney General ruled out that he was going to prosecute Rosen, on the question of a potential prosecution, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not something I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been involved in, heard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We know he was involved in it at the very least.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the question.\xc2\xa0 Was he not telling the truth on that point?\xc2\xa0 He was involved in it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Involved in what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He signed off on the search warrant.\xc2\xa0 Are you not involved after signing off on a search warrant?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those were his words.\xc2\xa0 He said it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys are conflating the subpoena with prosecution.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it is -- again, I would just point you to what the Attorney General said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is a technical accuracy you\xe2\x80\x99re holding on to.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that based on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in published reports and what the Attorney General said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the conflict.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the economy, the news seems pretty good.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- housing is doing great.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just wanted to point that out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a question.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to say that.\xc2\xa0 Consumer confidence, very good.\xc2\xa0 The stock market, Jay, is doing great.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment of the economy right now, in all seriousness, in terms of -- there are some people actually saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a bubble and it\xe2\x80\x99s getting too good.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, the other people would say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling it yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually not that good.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of where we are?\xc2\xa0 Because there are hopeful signs, but yet there\xe2\x80\x99s people who are still not feeling it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the economy is continuing to recover and continuing to strengthen in the aftermath of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 The indicators that you mention demonstrate that the recovery is continuing.\xc2\xa0 The news on housing is particularly welcome given the blow to the housing market that was caused by the financial crisis and the implosion of the housing bubble.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have much more work to do precisely for the reasons that you mention.\xc2\xa0 There are still too many people who are looking for work who have not found work.\xc2\xa0 There are still too many huge, unfilled, unmet needs when it comes to rebuilding our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And it is essential that Democrats and Republicans come together to take action on these economic items that have generally enjoyed bipartisan support and that would provide the kind of direct infusion into our economy and job creation into our economy, the long-term benefits of infrastructure development that will help our economy thrive in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We see too many instances that demonstrate anecdotally the fact that our infrastructure is in crying need of further investment.\xc2\xa0 We need to take steps to further invest in education in this country, again, for the long-term economic future.\xc2\xa0 We need to take steps to ensure that we are investing in areas of the economy that will produce the jobs of the future so that we are, even as we become more energy independent, we are not trading one form of importation of energy for another.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re creating the kinds of energy, 21st century energy, here in the United States, with jobs in the United States that will help us become more energy independent in the future.</p>\n<p>So the news you mention is welcome.\xc2\xa0 It is an indication of the strength and resiliency of our economy and of the American people.\xc2\xa0 It is also an indication of the fact that some very tough but correct policy decisions were made in 2009 and 2010, 2011 and 2012 that have helped put us on the path towards economic recovery and job creation.\xc2\xa0 But we are not there yet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not where we need to be yet, and we need to keep at it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say and others say that the American people are principally focused on these issues, and they expect their leaders in Washington to be principally focused on these issues -- the economy and job creation, and making the middle class more secure, making it more possible for middle-class kids and kids of families striving to get into the middle class to go to college, to get the education they need.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is committed to doing, is focusing on those issues.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes to continue to work with Congress to get things done that build on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very last quick follow-up on the economy, which is how does the sequester fit into this?\xc2\xa0 Because you said many times from this podium that it was going to really hurt the economy, and yet, you have to acknowledge -- because you want to acknowledge, obviously -- the economy is doing pretty well, even though the sequester has now had time to kick in.\xc2\xa0 So how do you square those two?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question -- and don\'t take our word for it, take the assessments of outside economists, take the assessments of the CBO that the sequester will cost jobs -- three-quarters of a million jobs according to the CBO.\xc2\xa0 It will cost us economic growth, up to half a percentage of economic growth according to the CBO.</p>\n<p>And while the economy is recovering and doing better, it could be recovering more and doing better still if we were not engaged in the process of inflicting wounds unnecessarily on the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that is what Washington all too often tends to do. And the embrace of the sequester is a perfect example of inflicting unnecessarily a wound to the economy when we should be reducing our deficit in a responsible and balanced way, and we should be investing in our economy that helps it grow even faster and create jobs at an even greater pace than we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced thus far.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, given the fact that the President is traveling this afternoon to Chicago in support of the DCCC, so he\xe2\x80\x99s engaging in the political process and campaigning this evening, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious to get his thoughts, if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen them through news reports, on Representative Michele Bachmann announcing that she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to seek a fifth term.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I came to the Briefing Room from the Oval Office, from a meeting, and I can tell you that that subject did not come up.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have a response from the President.\xc2\xa0 I think we all wish her well in her future endeavors.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Peter.\xc2\xa0 Did you have another one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, if I can briefly.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 I just had to get that off your plate.\xc2\xa0 We just heard just a short time ago from the commanding general in Southwestern Afghanistan saying today that the Taliban in Afghanistan will not be completely destroyed, and that the fighting season in Afghanistan is still up for grabs.\xc2\xa0 Given the comments you made earlier with some of the questions about the fact when we refer specifically to the Afghan theater, that by the end of 2014, there will be sufficient gains there for the policy to change as the President desires, do these new statements -- not entirely new -- but these specific ones today saying that the Taliban will not be fully defeated affect in any way the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on that issue?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a useful question because it helps -- it allows me to remind everyone what the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy in Afghanistan is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The objective for going into Afghanistan, which had been essentially lost by the time the President took office, was to go after those who attacked the United States on September 11th, 2001.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear through his policy review that we needed to refocus attention on that conflict and refocus on the goals that we had set for ourselves and needed to be clear:\xc2\xa0 to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda; to provide assistance to and create the breathing room for the Afghan government to allow for a process whereby we could transition security responsibility gradually to Afghan forces; and to ensure that through doing that, we made it impossible for Afghanistan to again become a haven for al Qaeda and like-minded extremists who have the destruction of the United States and Americans as an objective.</p>\n<p>It is not -- and that was made clear in the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy review and the statement of his policy -- the objective to defeat the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Reconciliation is part of the process in Afghanistan, the long-term process of bringing about a peaceful resolution to the conflict there.\xc2\xa0 Defeat of al Qaeda is a very clear objective.\xc2\xa0 But the long-term prospects for Afghanistan and for peaceful resolution of this conflict clearly has to include reconciliation.</p>\n<p>For those members of the Taliban who fight U.S. troops and who fight Afghan forces, they are clearly part of this conflict and we are engaged with them.\xc2\xa0 But in the long term, the objective is to defeat al Qaeda and to provide the training and assistance necessary to Afghan forces so that they can take control of the security of their country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final thought, digressing briefly, regarding the Attorney General and his efforts to reach out to news organizations for a meeting that\xe2\x80\x99s I believe supposed to happen at some point this week.\xc2\xa0 Was that done with any involvement from the White House?\xc2\xa0 Or was it done -- or any pressure or any encouragement even from the President, or done unilaterally by the Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made clear last week that he wanted this to happen and he wanted a review of these policies and procedures from the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a constructive and useful engagement because the President is very focused on and concerned about finding the necessary balance between the need to protect our key national security secrets on the one hand, and making sure that journalists are allowed to freely pursue investigative journalism and do their jobs.</p>\n<p>And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in what the President said last week.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in his continued support for a media shield law for which there is renewed support in the Senate -- and we commend Senator Schumer and Senator Graham and the others who are pushing on reintroducing a media shield law that is essentially the law that the President -- or the bill that the President and the administration negotiated with the Senate back in 2009, which enjoyed the support of media organizations as well as federal prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 We would very much like to see action on that in the U.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Congress is fixable and repairable?\xc2\xa0 Or does he think things have reached a point where the trust and confidence between the two have broken down?\xc2\xa0 And does he think that that is largely the fault of the Republicans, or has the Attorney General contributed to this ill will that now exists between them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the President believes that the Attorney General is doing a good job and the President has confidence in the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of matters that fall under the umbrella of your question.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed and he has made clear to every member of his Cabinet and every member of his team that we cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 And that has been the case in inquiry after inquiry from Congress, and that will continue to be the case.</p>\n<p>It is also true that, depending on the issue, that there are, sometimes, attempts to politicize matters that, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, should not be politicized, but should be focused on by both parties where there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that needs to be fixed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to Chicago to do some fundraising today.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve often talked about how -- one of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s biggest assets is the President\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xc2\xa0 Is it a good use of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time to be in Chicago, campaigning, raising money for Democratic candidates?\xc2\xa0 Or should he be making the case for his agenda, trying to build a congressional coalition for what he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to accomplish?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s time, I think, is devoted overwhelmingly to the former, as I think any who look at his schedule demonstrates.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the President has taken some time to support the DSCC or the DNC, or the DCCC is completely consistent with the activities of his predecessors of both parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think, again, if you look at what this President is focused on and the great majority of his time is dedicated to is the business of ensuring that we have the national security policies in place that keep this country safe and keep Americans safe, and that we are pursuing an agenda that helps the economy grow, helps the middle class feel more secure, and helps those who would aspire to the middle class obtain that status.\xc2\xa0 And those are the President\xe2\x80\x99s primary objectives.\xc2\xa0 And he has, as you know, in recent weeks, focused intensely on a number of legislative objectives, including comprehensive immigration reform and there has been marked progress on that particular issue.\xc2\xa0 There has been some progress on other issues.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to engage in Congress on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So several top administration officials are meeting with Latino and Hispanic business folks today.\xc2\xa0 The President did not drop in, is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he has or that that\xe2\x80\x99s on his schedule.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re correct that the White House will convene, or is convening the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top Hispanic business leaders from across the country today for the first-ever Hispanic business leaders forum.\xc2\xa0 And the event, which is held in conjunction with the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, will focus on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 About 80 top Hispanic business leaders are expected to attend the forum, and they come from a range of industries.\xc2\xa0 Many are from Fortune 500 firms or top professional firms, or from the next generation of high-growth entrepreneurial firms.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a variety of senior administration officials who are participating in that forum.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you help me to understand the link between those meetings or today\xe2\x80\x99s event and the President\xe2\x80\x99s push for comprehensive immigration reform on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 Does it leverage some of these guys to go to the Hill and make bipartisan --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The focus of the meeting today is on economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 These are -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that other topics might be raised, but that is the focus and purpose of the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 And the participants include the Treasury Secretary; the head of the Domestic Policy Council; the U.S. Chief Technology Officer; and Valerie Jarrett, the Senior Advisor to the President, who\xe2\x80\x99s also the Assistant to the President for Public Engagement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the focus, the purpose of the meeting -- and it was convened for this -- is to discuss job creation and economic growth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you also about the -- with Mr. Xi of China this week?\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be wide-ranging, that a bunch of different stuff is going to be discussed.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand kind of the balance between the desire by the two men to bond with one another, get to know each other -- and it seemed like the Chinese leader sort of did this thing for the U.S. last week by coming out strongly on North Korea -- and at the same time, like this elephant in the room is the cyber thing.\xc2\xa0 So is this more of -- do you see this as more of a dealing with tensions head on kind of meeting, or more of a let\xe2\x80\x99s set that aside and figure out what we can work on together?\xc2\xa0 How do you -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk tough and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk nice, how do they do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the signature of our approach to our bilateral relations with China and other countries is that we deal with both areas of cooperation and competition head on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very clear with the Chinese about issues of disagreement and very clear with the Chinese about issues where we see room for greater cooperation and coordination.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the case here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is true that the Chinese just completed a leadership transition, and, of course, the President was not that long ago reelected -- President Obama -- and so this is a good time for the two leaders to get together.\xc2\xa0 But the issues that you talk about have been present in the discussions between the leaders of both countries for some time now, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be.</p>\n<p>I mean, this is an issue -- a relationship that has elements of significant and important cooperation as well as competition, and we engage directly on both with the Chinese and we think that that is the best approach.\xc2\xa0 It is the way to further develop cooperation in our relation, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s military-to-military cooperation, or regional or global economic issues, or climate issues.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the way to deal with disagreements or areas of competition in our relationship.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we, on the matter of cybersecurity, as I mentioned, we welcome some of the statements coming out of Beijing on this, and the interest in pursuing a dialogue on these matters.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re very clear about our concerns.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very clear about the priority he places on cybersecurity for all the reasons I mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is the administration in the search for credible and corroborated facts about Syria\xe2\x80\x99s use of chemical weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with our partners and allies, as well as the opposition, very importantly, in putting together and gathering evidence and facts that corroborate the information that we have and build on it.\xc2\xa0 We continue to press for the Assad regime to allow U.N. investigators into the country to look into this matter --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get the evidence without them going in?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, without getting into sort of specifics about the process, the answer is we do have some ability, and we work with our partners and allies and, most importantly, the opposition on this matter.\xc2\xa0 But I can point you to what we said about the intelligence that we had gathered and the intelligence assessments that were available at the time --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if you found any credible and corroborated --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no new announcements on this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been about a month, I guess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make on it.\xc2\xa0 But we are continuing to pursue this matter.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that we consider to be very serious and important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 You seemed to be suggesting earlier that as the President talked about this balance between national security and the need for the press to do its job -- is the standard that a journalist isn\xe2\x80\x99t prosecuted -- in other words, being an unindicted coconspirator is still within the balance?\xc2\xa0 Where is the standard?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that two things should be said about this.\xc2\xa0 First, on a specific case, beyond the published reports, I can\'t really offer my comments and opinions about it.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the President said last week.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to some of the published reports that I was citing earlier about the disposition of that case, about the subpoena that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising.</p>\n<p>But I would also note that the President has asked for the Attorney General to review the procedures and policies in place that govern the approach to these matters when journalists are involved, as they tend to be, in investigations of the illegal leaking of classified information.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think you heard from the President and his views on this and his concerns about it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from me about my views both as a spokesman and as somebody with a background in journalism.</p>\n<p>Throughout this, it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to lose sight of the fact that we are talking about classified information, the leaking of which is a crime.\xc2\xa0 And unless, as I said one day last week or the week before, there were the suggestions that we should simply make all information available to everybody, including al Qaeda and AQAP and everyone around the world, and eliminate that and just make it freely available and deal with the national security consequences, there has to be some process in place that allows for the protection of that classified information, that allows for there to be consequences if individuals who have sworn to keep those secrets break the law by not keeping them.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I was just curious about the venue -- the choice of venue for the meeting with the Chinese President.\xc2\xa0 Why is it in California rather than the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 The President -- President Obama was looking forward to meeting with, early after the Chinese transition, the leadership transition there in China, with President Xi in his new capacity to discuss the full range of diplomatic, economic and defense issues on the U.S.-China agenda.\xc2\xa0 And the President had domestic travel planned for the West Coast and California emerged as a good location for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a fundraiser?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He had domestic travel in California.\xc2\xa0 California is closer to Asia obviously, and California became a useful place and a good place to have this meeting.\xc2\xa0 They are meeting at Sunnylands, the Annenberg Estate, which is a private location that has hosted Presidents in the past, and will allow the Presidents and -- both Presidents and a small group of advisors to have the kind of in-depth discussions that I know President Obama is looking forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll do a two-and-two after their meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked out all of the details of the schedule yet.</p>\n<p>Let me move around in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 The British and the French are talking now about new evidence and new cases of use of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 They even notified the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 While there is no reason to believe that the Assad regime will allow the inspectors -- investigators to go inside Syria and investigate, is the President entertaining the possibility that we would never know that the red line was crossed, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 One is we are working with our allies and partners, obviously including the English -- the British and the French, on this issue and, importantly, the opposition on this issue, on the effort to gather evidence about the potential use of chemical weapons, or to build on the evidence that we have already gathered.\xc2\xa0 And I think as you heard the President say and others say, it is very important that we be very sure and clear about the facts that we have and that those facts are corroborated and they are reviewable, and that if the case is to be made for a policy response that we ought to be able to make a very strong case.</p>\n<p>And at the time that we were discussing this, it was noted that there is some history of -- that I think demonstrates the need to be absolutely sure of your facts and absolutely sure that you have the ability to put together a series of facts that can be corroborated and reviewed and assessed if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to contemplate a policy response to crossing the red line.</p>\n<p>So we are in that process.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our allies. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a concerted effort from a number of areas to try to gather information about this possible chemical weapons use -- to document it, to prove it, and then to move forward once that process is continued -- completed, rather.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said from the podium repeatedly that Bashar al-Assad has to go.\xc2\xa0 In a television interview, the Syrian Foreign Minister now says that Assad will remain the President of Syria until the 2014 elections and may run again.\xc2\xa0 Does any of that comport with what the White House thinks the timeline should be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that Assad has made clear that he intends to cling on to power, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s news.\xc2\xa0 I think the Syrian people disagree.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we clearly disagree and, again, more importantly, the Syrian people, but allies of the Syrian opposition and people around the region and the world disagree with the proposition that Assad has a future as the leader of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the process that we talk about with the Geneva Communique has to result in a post-Assad Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the composition of the group of participants in those discussions and that would obviously be something that everyone has to agree to, including the opposition.\xc2\xa0 But the end result here has to be a political transition that does not include at the end Bashar al-Assad in power.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could that be through an election that happens in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are interested in bringing about that transition as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'ve worked very assiduously on establishing, reinvigorating the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9 process and setting up a conference in June.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to press to bring this about as quickly as possible, mindful of the many challenges that are out there to the conclusion of this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a reaction to Governor Chafee of Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee, saying that he is going to switch parties to become a Democrat?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the President welcomes Governor Chafee to the party.\xc2\xa0 Governor Chafee has been a longtime supporter of President Obama, and not as a party matter, but as a supporter of the President and his policy proposals.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any other response beyond that.</p>\n<p>Yes, Andrei.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on Russia.\xc2\xa0 As we know, recently, the Russians delivered their own message to the President.\xc2\xa0 I understand you cannot talk about the contents of the document.\xc2\xa0 But has the President been able to review it?\xc2\xa0 What is the general reaction?\xc2\xa0 Is it moving forward?\xc2\xa0 What\'s happening?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to take your question.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of a document.\xc2\xa0 But I can say that obviously we communicate with the Russian leadership all the time and the President has had several conversations fairly recently with President Putin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Russian President\'s National Security Advisor recently visited and brought a message --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have any information about those communications for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you take the message -- could you take the question, please?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can take the question.\xc2\xa0 But my guess is we\'re not going to discuss those kind of communications.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, Jay, I\'m listening to all this and basically a general-type question is do you still regard Syria as a country that\'s governed by international laws, that\'s covered by laws, to which international laws apply -- notions such as sovereignty and integrity or whatever?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is international laws do apply, including laws of human rights.\xc2\xa0 And it is an abomination for a regime to participate in the massacre of tens of thousands of its citizens.\xc2\xa0 That is an abomination.\xc2\xa0 And the world sees that.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people live it.\xc2\xa0 And we are committed, with our allies and partners and the Syrian opposition, to bringing about a future -- or helping bring about a future for Syria that is a marked improvement on its present.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I was bringing this up was because I simply don\'t understand how a lawmaker from a different country can come into a place, into a different country\'s territory and basically call for a regime change or something like that.\xc2\xa0 What legal basis is there for that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been making clear as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria, that he has massacred his own people, that he has the blood of his own people on his hands.\xc2\xa0 And that that process continues.\xc2\xa0 Bashar al-Assad long ago gave up the opportunity to participate in a transition process that would improve the future of the Syrian people and the Syrian nation.\xc2\xa0 He chose instead to wage war on his people.\xc2\xa0 And we are unapologetic about a policy position that calls for a future in Syria that does not include a tyrant who has demonstrated his willingness to murder his own people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he an outlaw?\xc2\xa0 And does it make Syria a no-man\'s land legally?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even sure what your question is.\xc2\xa0 I get the sort of basic motivation behind it.\xc2\xa0 I think we just disagree on our basic view of the situation in Syria.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:12 P.M.
