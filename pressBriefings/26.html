EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One, everybody, en route to Silicon Valley, where the President will lead the U.S. delegation to the 7th Annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\xc2\xa0 This summit was born out of the President\'s 2009 Cairo speech and has become an annual event in connecting entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem supporters from across the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGES is a reflection of our commitment to build more prosperous, secure, and globally connected communities around the world.\xc2\xa0 As you know, good ideas come from everywhere.\xc2\xa0 However, access to capital and opportunity is not the same everywhere.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why our goal at this year\'s summit is to connect the United States with new audiences and partners worldwide, especially focused on women, youth and minorities to fulfill their potential.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama will join approximately 1,200 attendees, including entrepreneurs, investors, ecosystem supporters, educators, business representatives, and government officials, all of whom represent the full measure of entrepreneurial talent from diverse backgrounds across our nation and around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe spirit of innovation is what makes America exceptional, and its results continue to drive American leadership around the world.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to his time with entrepreneurs and will continue his innovation efforts at home and abroad for the remainder of his term.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m happy to take questions on that or any topic that may be on your mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, could you talk a little bit about the court decision today?\xc2\xa0 Another executive action falling by the wayside.\xc2\xa0 The President talked ad nauseam about taking action when Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t act.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any regrets about that strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 As you heard the President speak a few hours ago at the White House, he is disappointed that the Court couldn\xe2\x80\x99t issue a decision today.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, this dates back to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That was a bill that Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate came together to work out.\xc2\xa0 It was not a bill that Democrats jammed down Republicans\' throats.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bill that the President dictated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, he was quite clear at the time that if he was writing the piece of legislation, it would look different.\xc2\xa0 But it represented a compromise.\xc2\xa0 It represented Republicans and Democrats working together on one of the pressing issues of our time.\xc2\xa0 And that passed by almost 70 votes in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, when it went to the House of Representatives, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t reject the bill, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote it down.\xc2\xa0 They actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the courage to bring it up for a vote.\xc2\xa0 House Republicans completely abdicated their responsibility by not allowing a vote on this piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo many at the time speculated -- and I think with a lot of justification -- that the reason it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up for a vote is it would have passed.\xc2\xa0 So as you point out, the President at the time, and today -- at the time since, and even today, said the best way to deal with this problem is for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration.\xc2\xa0 He was also very clear that that\'s very unlikely in this Congress, and that\'s why he made clear that there\'s going to have to be a debate in this country in order for that to get done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously the ruling today only applied to the parents of DREAMers or U.S. citizens.\xc2\xa0 It does not apply to the President\'s executive action on DACA.\xc2\xa0 What is your message to those children who were brought here illegally?\xc2\xa0 Should they feel confident that the status that they\'ve been given by the administration will hold up to any legal challenges that could go through the same system that this one did?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You are right, Justin -- the DACA program that the President announced in 2012 was not an issue in this case, so that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t subject to any judicial review.\xc2\xa0 As the President pointed out, over 730,000 participants have gone through that program.\xc2\xa0 That program will continue to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And recipients and the participants of that program are our teachers, they\'re our neighbors, they\'re our police officers, they\'re our small business owners.\xc2\xa0 So they continue to be contributing members to society.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other piece of the President\'s record on this that was not subject -- that was not a part of this case was the Department of Homeland Security enforcement priorities announced by the President in 2014.\xc2\xa0 Again, those priorities remain unchanged and unaffected by this case.\xc2\xa0 And to remind you, those priorities are criminals, recent border-crossers, and threats to national security.\xc2\xa0 So the Homeland Security priorities that were announced also remain unchanged, and I think that\'s important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the President has, as you point out, for a long time laid the failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform at the Congress\'s feet, at the Republicans\' feet.\xc2\xa0 But the fact remains that while he has been in office, there have been a large number of deportations and very little to show for his efforts to get a legislative -- nothing to show for his efforts to get a legislative solution through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And now because of the Court\'s action today, not as much to show for his efforts to address this with executive power as he would have liked.\xc2\xa0 Is he frustrated about that?\xc2\xa0 He is going to be remembered by a lot of these groups that count immigration among their top priorities as not a very successful President on addressing the plight of the 11 million who are here.\xc2\xa0 So what does he have to say to those people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, I quibble with some parts of your question, namely that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to show for the legislative effort.\xc2\xa0 If you recall, there was a lot of independent reporting and analysis that getting the United States Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform in a bipartisan way was a far-fetched prediction.\xc2\xa0 It turns out Republicans and Democrats were able to roll up their sleeves and work together on one of the most challenging and complex issues of our time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do think that that was an important milestone to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn\xe2\x80\x99t just common sense, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the right thing to do consistent with American values, it\'s not just widely supported by wide swaths of the American people, but it\'s also legislatively doable.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, House Republicans, for reasons still unclear, refuse to call that bill up for even a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\'re right, legislatively there still remains a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President was clear that the best way to fix to address this problem is going to be through comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President was also clear that that\'s unlikely to happen in this Congress, and that\'s why he expects a debate amongst the American people on the best pathway forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other, I think, answer to your question is, there does remain additional work that the President has done on this issue that remains in place, and that, as Justin referenced, includes the DACA program announced in the summer of 2012.\xc2\xa0 At the time, the President announced that our lowest priorities for enforcement were these diligent, patriotic young DREAMers who grew up pledging allegiance to the flag, and that they should be able to apply to work, study and pay their taxes here.\xc2\xa0 Since then, more than 730,000 people have come out of the shadows and their lives have been changed as a result.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, today\'s decision doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect those people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'d also say, it\'s one of the reason why comprehensive immigration reform has such wide support.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got support from the evangelical community.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got support from business leaders, from law enforcement, obviously from the Hispanic community, from unions.\xc2\xa0 So you see wide and diverse constituency groups supporting this, and yet you see Republicans on the Hill throwing up their hands and doing nothing about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, some of these groups called today after the ruling for a flat halt on deportations.\xc2\xa0 Not one more person to be deported until something can be done about the broader issue.\xc2\xa0 Is that anything the President would consider?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that discussed.\xc2\xa0 Again, the deportation priorities that the Department of Homeland Security announced back in 2014 remain in place.\xc2\xa0 And those priorities are recent border-crossers, threats to national security, and criminals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been some criticism from congressional Republicans about this latest detainee that was transferred out of Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 Are we more likely to -- first off, what\'s the justification for his release?\xc2\xa0 And as the population dwindles, are we more likely to see some of these controversial figures and some of these more hardened terrorists, like this guy who evidently was a bodyguard for bin Laden -- are we more likely to see people like that transferred to other countries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the criticism, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there are specific points you\'d like me to respond to.\xc2\xa0 I can say generally speaking that Abdel Malik Rahabi was approved for transfer by the Periodic Review Board, a discretionary, administrative, interagency body that determined by consensus that his continued detention was no longer necessary to protect a significant continuing threat to the security of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States is very grateful to the government of Montenegro for its continued assistance in closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Montenegro now joins other friends and allies in Europe in accepting multiple detainees for -- by bringing us closer to our shared goal of closing the facility.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll also say that we only make these decisions when our national security officials are sure that the protections are in place to make sure that a former detainee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pose a threat to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll also say that this is consistent with the President\'s goal of closing down the facility at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve spent a lot of time talking about why the President believes that\'s a worthy goal.\xc2\xa0 Namely, it\'s exorbitantly expensive.\xc2\xa0 We can accomplish the same things.\xc2\xa0 We can protect our security in a much more cost-effective way.\xc2\xa0 This is a facility that\'s a known propaganda tool for terrorists who want to do us harm.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also inconsistent with our values.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, that is a goal that the President has, but it\'s also a goal shared by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 President George W. Bush believes that facility should be closed.\xc2\xa0 Senator John McCain believes that facility should be closed.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a wide number of national security experts, both affiliated with the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, who believe that facility should be closed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on Zika?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You can.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw Josh\'s statement last night about the conference report, conference agreement.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you can explain a little bit about why -- I mean, $1.1 billion sounds like quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, is the President prepared to veto it?\xc2\xa0 Are his advisors going to recommend that he veto that bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, as you referenced the statement last night, we are disappointed that Republicans turned this into a political exercise. \xc2\xa0This is a conference report that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it can even pass the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 But if it did, and the President was presented with the bill, he would veto it.\xc2\xa0 And let me explain why.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, it\'s woefully inadequate.\xc2\xa0 Our public health professionals estimate that the federal government needs $1.9 billion of funding to attack this emergency.\xc2\xa0 This bill falls far short of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a bill that would also steal money from other critically important public health priorities, including those funded by the Affordable Care Act and those funded by our effort to combat Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So at the end of the day, this bill does not provide adequate funding.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, this bill unfortunately includes an ideological rider blocking access to contraception for women in the U.S., including those in Puerto Rico, even though Zika is a sexually transmitted disease and even though it has been transmitted in Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 It makes no sense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'d also draw your attention to provision in this bill that guts some provisions of the Clean Water Act.\xc2\xa0 So for those reasons, the President would veto this bill if it ever got to his desk.\xc2\xa0 Again I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen much analysis that suggests it could even pass the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, we urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football, to actually get to work, and come up with a proposal that\'s going to serve the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, it\'s a public health emergency.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it better than nothing to have that money?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\'re right, it is a public health emergency, and that\'s all the more reason why it\'s unfortunate that Republicans want to turn this into a partisan exercise.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that -- well, let me rephrase.\xc2\xa0 In the past, when we\'ve had public health emergencies like Ebola or like the H1N1 virus, Democrats and Republicans come together to make sure the federal government has the resources they need.\xc2\xa0 One party doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just huddle in the corner, come up with an ideological bill, and then throw up their hands and leave.\xc2\xa0 It\'s time for Republicans to join Democrats in coming up with a viable solution to make sure the government has the resources they need to combat this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd let me give you some examples.\xc2\xa0 Money is desperately needed to fight Zika because mosquito control, a central element of efforts to combat the virus, is spotty and underfunded.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s look at Florida, specifically.\xc2\xa0 The battle to squash the virus began many months ago, but some two dozen local governments in Florida are collectively seeking millions of dollars to stop that threat.\xc2\xa0 Florida needs to hire more inspectors, buy more insecticide, lay more mosquito traps, and conduct a more effective campaign to enlist the public\'s help in eradicating mosquito-breeding areas.\xc2\xa0 Nothing the House has done so far furthers any of those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Be that as it may, though, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House, or isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President worried that by potentially blocking or turning down this legislation, that it will look like it\'s your fault, it\'s the White House\'s fault for not getting people the money that they need for mosquito programs or what have you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, this is a plan that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t adequately fund the crisis, that actually blocks contraception for women in the United States and in Puerto Rico, even though this exact virus is a sexually transmitted disease.\xc2\xa0 And it also steals money away from critically important public health priorities.\xc2\xa0 We have public health experts on the ground right now in West Africa, making sure that the precautions and safeguards are in place to prevent another Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Republicans think it\'s a good idea to take those people off duty, underfund that effort in order to rob Peter to pay Paul.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s talked in the past about Freddie Gray, and I know Officer Caesar Goodson today was found not guilty on all accounts in that case.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious about the President\'s reaction and if the White House has any reaction to that decision today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darren, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction from the President to read out to you, namely because there are ongoing federal investigations in the Baltimore Police Department and into the death of Freddie Gray, so it\'s going to be difficult for us to comment on today\'s decision by the Court.\xc2\xa0 But generally speaking, I would say our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the loved ones of Freddie Gray.\xc2\xa0 As you may remember, the President discussed this issue at length last April.\xc2\xa0 And so for more on how the President views this, I would draw your attention to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can I ask about the incident in the theater in Germany, if you have any details on what exactly transpired there?\xc2\xa0 Whether the President has been in touch with Chancellor Merkel, or top U.S. officials have.\xc2\xa0 If there\'s any nexus with ISIS, of course.\xc2\xa0 And if the U.S. has taken any counterterrorism steps after that incident.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Justin, obviously we\'re aware of the situation you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that United States officials were in touch with their German counterparts.\xc2\xa0 Usually that\'s communication that\'s handled through our National Security Council and through the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on this earlier today, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any steps to announce in response to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any indication if there was a relation to terrorism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re going to defer to the German authorities.\xc2\xa0 If they have any results of their preliminary investigation, I\'m sure they\'ll share it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, how is the President -- or is he staying abreast of the Brexit vote?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to Cameron?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to anyone in the UK today about what\'s going on there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Julie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls from the President to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I would expect that we\'d have a reaction once there\'s results.\xc2\xa0 But until then, I think our position has been clear, which is ultimately this is a decision for the British people to make.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that a strong United Kingdom voice in a strong EU has great benefits to the United States and to the international community.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we had a chance to make that case in a trip to London earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 Some of you were able to join us on that.\xc2\xa0 He laid out a handful of reasons why he thinks that.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, the United Kingdom historically has outsized influence on the economic and security issues around the world.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that influence continues.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the UK can exercise that influence and leverage its relationships more effectively if it remains in the European Union.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, on the economic front, we believe that jobs, investment, trade, that the UK is better off if it stays within the EU.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then third, on a host of issues facing Europe -- ranging from migration to the economy to terrorism -- the EU is more capable of facing down those issues with a strong United Kingdom included.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any real-time updates for you on the White House reaction to the vote as it undergoes -- or as it happens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He\'s not getting briefed on any --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think he\'ll be briefed as soon as there\'s something to brief him on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, kind of related to politics.\xc2\xa0 I know the tragedy in Orlando postponed him actually campaigning with Hillary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Is there any update on when that might sort of come back into something that the White House is going to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darren, as you mentioned, there was a trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin for President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 That did get postponed in the wake of the terrorist attack in Orlando.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a new date yet on the books, but I do know the President, which he has said, is looking forward to campaigning.\xc2\xa0 As soon as an event for the both of them is scheduled, we\'ll make sure to let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Would they try to go back to Green Bay?\xc2\xa0 Or are they looking at something completely different?\xc2\xa0 Whatever Hillary Clinton is coming up next in her schedule fit in that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As soon as we have another event at which the President plans to campaign with Secretary Clinton, we\'ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure if we\'ve locked in a location yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, just staying with the campaign fundraising theme, can I ask about the Seattle trip real quick?\xc2\xa0 He\'s campaigning for the DCCC and for the governors\' race.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that Democrats -- he can help them make a lot of inroads with the House and with the, I guess, the minority among the governorships across the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President is not only President of the United States, but in that role he\'s also the head of the Democratic Party, and he does take his responsibilities seriously to make sure that campaigns have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns.\xc2\xa0 And so you\'ve seen him fundraise aggressively for the congressional campaign committees.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have a DCCC event later on this trip and an event for Governor Inslee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yeah, I do think you\'ll see the President out there both making sure that campaigns and committees have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns, but also making the public case for why he believes Democrats would be the best stewards of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think Democrats can take the House this election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, he absolutely believes that the elections are going to be an important moment -- an historic election, actually -- and that the opportunity that Democrats have to make inroads in the House and in the Senate are opportunities that are going to be important.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s going to make sure -- he\'s going to work to make sure that he does his part.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President speak with John Lewis after the sit-in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls like that to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that everyone at the White House was and is very supportive of Congressman Lewis\'s actions that he took yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the President being supportive.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw the President tweeted out a message of support, and that\'s just the latest gesture in support of Congress taking action and demanding action.\xc2\xa0 I think what you saw in the House over the past 24 hours is embarrassing for House Republican leadership.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They won\'t even call for a vote.\xc2\xa0 These are common-sense reforms supported by bipartisan majorities around the country, supported by law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 My colleague Josh Earnest called the Senate vote "a shameful display of cowardice."\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what to call the House Republican leadership because they won\'t even have the courage to call for a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Speaker of the House believes that those who are too dangerous, as determined by our Homeland Security officials, to board a plane, but that that same individual ought to be able to purchase a firearm, then the Speaker of the House should have the courage to call the yays and nays and call for a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Speaker of the House believes that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have universal background checks, a position -- by the way, universal background checks enjoys 85 percent support in the state of Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 If the Speaker of the House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\'s worth a vote, isn\'t worth passing, then call the bluff and call a vote.\xc2\xa0 Have it be voted down.\xc2\xa0 But instead, they decided to shill for Wall Street banks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans, though, said that they called the sit-in a stunt and criticized Democrats for fundraising off of it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering what the White House thinks.\xc2\xa0 Is it appropriate for members to be fundraising off of what essentially was a protest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 If Republicans think it\'s a stunt, they should call our bluff.\xc2\xa0 Call the yays and nays.\xc2\xa0 Make everyone vote.\xc2\xa0 The sit-in will end.\xc2\xa0 But instead, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even have the courage to call for a vote.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t even want their members to be on the record opposing these common-sense gun safety reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, nothing that\'s being proposed is particularly controversial or counter-intuitive.\xc2\xa0 But if our Homeland Security officials decide that you\'re too dangerous to board a plane, then it only follows that you\'re probably not the right person to purchase a firearm.\xc2\xa0 And if the Speaker of the House wants to go to bat for someone suspected of terrorist ties to be able to purchase a firearm, then he should go ahead and take back the floor of the House, and make a speech and then call the votes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s okay to fundraise off it?\xc2\xa0 No problem with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, one way for -- if Republicans were really upset about this, they could end it by allowing these common-sense measures supported by a bipartisan number of Americans -- I\'m sorry a vast majority of Americans from both political parties call it for a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you guys send over pizza or coffee or anything?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that everybody in the White House, including the President, believes what Congressman Lewis has led was an important thing to do, and underscored the dereliction of responsibility by the House leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President to fundraise off of this debate at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any plans to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some opponents of this have said that it\'s kind of an unprecedented breakdown of order up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken a lot recently about the need to un-coarsen our discourse and to sort of return to a normal dialogue where people can come together.\xc2\xa0 Is there any worry that this sets a precedent of kind of more dysfunction on Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you want to talk about dysfunction on Capitol Hill, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s any new precedent needed.\xc2\xa0 We have an unquestionably qualified Supreme Court nominee languishing in the United States Senate for 99 days because Senate Republicans have failed to do their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s not just the President or Democrats who believe that this nominee is qualified to be on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It\'s Republicans who believe that this nominee is qualified to be on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It\'s Bush administration officials, like the Bush administration attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, who believes that Merrick Garland should be confirmed for the United States Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It\'s legal scholars from across the political spectrum who believe Merrick Garland should be confirmed for the United States Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It is United States Senator Orrin Hatch who called Merrick Garland a consensus nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if Republicans for the first time in American history want to abdicate their responsibility in the United States Senate to do their job, I\'m not sure there\'s much new precedent that can be set for congressional dysfunction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to suggest in his comments today after the immigration ruling that, had Republicans in Congress been willing to take a vote on Merrick Garland\'s nomination, then the outcome here would have been different, and I have to assume he meant that his executive actions would have stood.\xc2\xa0 How does he know that?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked with Judge Garland about how he would have ruled in this case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President was talking about was, if the Court was fully staffed, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been a 4-4 indecision.\xc2\xa0 So we would have had a fully staffed Court.\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you the President has actually been very clear that when he meets with potential Supreme Court nominees, he actually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up pending cases or likely cases that would be heard before the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 So I think we actually know that he has not spoken with Chief Judge Garland about this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I do think the President was talking about is a sentiment that he actually put forward before he selected Chief Judge Garland for this spot, which is the Court should be fully staffed.\xc2\xa0 Never in its history has the Court gone -- never in its history will the Court have gone as long as it\'s going to go because of Republican intransience.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sentiment just expressed by the President or by Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Republicans feel this way too.\xc2\xa0 President Reagan said with each passing day that when the Court isn\xe2\x80\x99t fully staffed, it impairs its ability to do its job.\xc2\xa0 We have no more starker example of that than today\'s non-decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of implication here that he said this election matters and is sort of an evaluation of where we are as a country?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it implicit in that that if you vote for Hillary Clinton, you\'re going to get a judge to kind of affirm my executive orders on immigration?\xc2\xa0 Or would you not make that link that voting for Democrats this fall equals immigration protection for more undocumented immigrants?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I would not make that link.\xc2\xa0 I actually think that the President was making a broader argument, which is if you go back to comprehensive immigration reform, which failed in the United States House of Representatives because the leadership wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up for a vote, that was a sign of dysfunction.\xc2\xa0 That was House Republican leadership being too scared to bring up a bill for a vote because they knew it would pass.\xc2\xa0 That dysfunction has now metastasized to the United States Senate, where they won\'t even hold a hearing for a Supreme Court nominee who everybody agrees is eminently qualified.\xc2\xa0 He actually brings more experience to this nomination than any Supreme Court nominee in the history of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be -- just so I\'m crystal clear, the President was not suggesting that had Merrick Garland been on the Supreme Court, that the decision would have gone in the President\'s favor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear previously that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss pending cases before the United States Supreme Court, or even likely cases with potential nominees.\xc2\xa0 That comes from an interview with National Public Radio, in case you want to reference those quotes directly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I think the President was saying is this dysfunction we\'ve seen in the legislative branch in now infecting the judiciary, and that Senate Republicans refusing to do their job and refusing to allow the Court to be fully staffed impairs the ability of that Court to do its job.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not just my argument; President Reagan made that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been reports that Volkswagen has reached a settlement of more than $10 million for the scandal surrounding diesel cars.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President, if the White House has a reaction to that, and your guys\' involvement in sort of negotiating that settlement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to you for that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I\'d refer you to the parties involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Congressman Fattah do any favors for Democrats by resigning effective immediately rather than serving until -- he said he was going to go until October 3rd.\xc2\xa0 And then it seemed like Republicans were threatening to exploit him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, I saw some news reports on the Congressman\'s decision before we took off this morning.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional reaction to you from the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\'s tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any lawmakers on board?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'ll get you a list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And any tech luminaries or CEOs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one quick question?\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Josh yesterday, he said that the President is discussing being an NBA minority owner in his post-presidency.\xc2\xa0 How seriously is he considering that?\xc2\xa0 And is he at all advancing in those discussions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, for more details on that, I would refer you to the President\'s conversation with Bill Simmons, where this came up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what Josh was referring to yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is very focused on his remaining days in office.\xc2\xa0 We have about six or seven months left.\xc2\xa0 He\'s made clear to us that he\'s not going to take his foot off the gas.\xc2\xa0 So I am sure in the back of his mind he\'s thinking about the post-presidency, but I know in the front of his mind are a lot of priorities left to fulfill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:07 P.M.
