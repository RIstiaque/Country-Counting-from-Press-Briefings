CDT</p>\n<p>Q Do you have anything on the -- reaction from the President to the Sestak --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been dealing with oil today.\xc2\xa0 I will go talk to him about this after this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on all this stuff today.</p>\n<p>Q What does the President have to say about the fact that some of his staunchest supporters like James Carville have essentially turned on him, have some strong things to say about the way he\xe2\x80\x99s been handling the oil spill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Truthfully, I think the President answered this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think people -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think James understands all of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think James understood the facts.</p>\n<p>Q Robert, has the President spoken to CEO Hayward at all during this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He has -- you know, obviously Ken Salazar has dealt with BP on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu has been in Houston for most of this week; he went down there starting on Monday to work through some of what was going on on the top kill procedure and to help -- with our scientists and the national scientists on that.\xc2\xa0 But he has not talked to him.</p>\n<p>Q Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t these two guys -- two top guys talked about the situation?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems like a natural thing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I think we get plenty of information from BP on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>Q Robert, did the President and President Clinton discuss this Sestak thing yesterday when they had lunch together?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about the lunch.</p>\n<p>Q When did you personally find out about the Clinton connection?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have talked to people -- I answered questions on this I think in March that nothing inappropriate had happened based on conversations that I\'d had with the lawyers.\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to go back and look at notes.</p>\n<p>Q Robert, if the Sestak incident wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the purpose for the lunch yesterday, what was the purpose for the lunch with --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President was -- President Clinton was in town for the World Cup.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s heading our efforts to get the World Cup in -- I\'m going to get my dates wrong, as a soccer player -- either 2018 or 2020 I think we\'re bidding for.\xc2\xa0 So he was in town and at the White House for that.\xc2\xa0 And I think whenever you have a former President -- these guys tend to get together and talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the world.</p>\n<p>Q Robert, does the President still believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting the right information from BP in a timely manner?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'re hearing that the operation was delayed, shut down, whatever you want to call it, in terms of pumping in the mud, and yet officials didn\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What do you mean, was shut down?</p>\n<p>Q You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s all this debate as to what was done. There was a period of time when the top kill, as we understand it, was not happening -- this pumping of mud -- and apparently administration officials didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that this had occurred.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I don\'t think that\'s even close to being accurate.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where you\'re getting that information.</p>\n<p>Q That they stopped pumping the mud?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, that they -- look, to get -- to put the type of pressure with this drilling mud that you need to put into a well to -- four miles underneath the surface is an oil reserve that is, as we see from this video gushing up -- right?\xc2\xa0 So the mud, in order to seal this permanently, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pump mud in at a speed and a pace that turns the oil in this direction back in this direction; and that when you do that, the pressure has to decrease at a steady rate until the well is stabilized.</p>\n<p>So there are periods in which you are pumping mud at varying degrees, degrees of pace, and there are times in which you\xe2\x80\x99re going to switch out boats that have thousands of barrels of mud on them, understanding that -- the figures that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and that were originally discussed, they were going to have to pump 50 barrels of mud a minute into the blowout preventer and into the well in order to change the direction of that.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have equipment that can do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there have been several points at which they have pumped mud at that pace, and there have also been points that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t pumped mud or they\xe2\x80\x99ve switched ships that had mud -- I think there were two or three boats in the area that had mud.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly have never been under the impression that for the past -- when did this thing start -- on Wednesday, on Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been pumping mud continuously.\xc2\xa0 I certainly have never been under that --</p>\n<p>Q So I just want to -- the question, I guess, is, do you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting all the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu has been in Houston.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\'t -- been working through -- again, Secretary Chu with our scientists have been working through a number of these plans.\xc2\xa0 I spent 45 minutes on a conference call last night with the Secretary of Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Admiral Allen and Secretary Chu.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting plenty of information.</p>\n<p>Q So why weren\xe2\x80\x99t there any BP people at the table today at the meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the meeting today -- and I think the President believes that they had a good meeting about the actions and the things that the governor of Louisiana and the representatives from Louisiana, the local parishes, the Coast Guard -- all of the coordination activities that we all want to see work as best as possible.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also had the governors from Alabama and Florida there, which obviously, depending on the direction of the wind, the direction of the water, may deal with this in some varying degree over the next several --</p>\n<p>Q But since BP is the responsible party, why weren\xe2\x80\x99t they at the table?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Admiral Allen is in fairly close contact with BP.\xc2\xa0 There are -- but this was a meeting about making sure that -- and look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s main message is, if there are things you want and need from us, we want to make sure that, in addition to the daily calls that are done with the governors, that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to walk through what those things are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They spent a long time talking about the barrier islands.\xc2\xa0 They spent time talking about different legislative things that have been proposed, quite frankly, over many years to deal with what some states feel like are inequities on royalties.\xc2\xa0 They spent time talking about -- a little time talking about top kill and what happens next, if top kill is not ultimately successful.\xc2\xa0 And they talked about barrier and boom and how to plan for where this oil moves, understanding that it\xe2\x80\x99s not one monolithic slick.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- because of the dispersants and such, it\xe2\x80\x99s broken up, it\xe2\x80\x99s moved in different areas, different chunks have gone in different directions.</p>\n<p>Q The meeting, we were originally -- thought it would be about 20 minutes or half an hour, and it ended up being, what --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Almost two hours.</p>\n<p>Q Almost two hours.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we had a lot of people and the President -- no, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you guys saw the still pictures that those guys took, but I think there were probably 15 people around the table and the President asked each of the people --</p>\n<p>Q Is that more --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There were more parish presidents than we, I think, originally expected.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we invited the governors.\xc2\xa0 We had Admiral Allen, Carol Browner, Rear Admiral Landry, Rear Admiral Watson -- so we had a bunch of representatives also from the Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to hear from everybody, give everybody a chance to speak and give everybody a chance to try to respond.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q Was it a friendly meeting?\xc2\xa0 Was it a --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, you know --</p>\n<p>Q -- voices raised?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember any -- at any point in which voices were raised.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, people want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing -- we\xe2\x80\x99re getting timely requests and that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we can.\xc2\xa0 I think the point the President made was -- and I think he said this throughout this, which is if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got something you think will work, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to take a look at it, and if it works, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to do it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q How does the rest of the weekend look?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to New York.</p>\n<p>Q Okay, have a nice trip.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying that -- the BP people are saying that they may know on Sunday whether this thing works.\xc2\xa0 Could we conceivably see the President on Sunday on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we may -- the truth is I, obviously, am not listening to what Rear Admiral Landry is saying here.\xc2\xa0 I need to get an update on when -- on what the timing is. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity we might know before Sunday.\xc2\xa0 I expect that the President will talk with -- again talk with Secretary Chu about what he has seen, where we are with this, and then, like I said, if this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t successful, what the scientists down there have been working on in terms of next steps.</p>\n<p>Q I mean, just for our guidance planning, do you think he\xe2\x80\x99d come out and talk over the weekend?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that yet.</p>\n<p>Q Robert, the President, does he come away from this trip feeling more encouraged, based on the information that he got today and seeing it, in terms of this situation being capped, the well being capped, and the cleanup --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p>Q -- more optimistic about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say two different things.\xc2\xa0 On the plan to plug the hole, obviously we\'ve gotten updates throughout the top kill procedure, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to -- we\'re obviously all hopeful and optimistic.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have a sense of, as I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re in a period of pumping mud right now -- there was just a chyron up here that I would point you to, Dan, so that you guys, based on your earlier question -- some periods of pumping mud and some periods of pressure readouts and diagnostic testing -- because, again, not to go through some of the stuff that we went through before, but once you pump that mud in you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to evaluate whether or not -- where the pressure is, has it decreased to a point -- because again, if that\'s successful you\xe2\x80\x99ll begin making decisions not long after that to the degree to which you can form a more permanent seal with cement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, look, we\'re hopeful.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ll know in the next -- over the course of the next many hours where we are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the response and the cleanup, I think the President believes that we have -- that we\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'ve been lucky that and fortunate that the spill had not hit -- did not hit land for several weeks. I mean, obviously we could -- I think the first day we did a long briefing in the briefing room, which would have been the 29th of April, there was some discussion that oil would hit land within the next day after that.\xc2\xa0 So, look, we were fortunate, based on the winds and the currents, that that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.</p>\n<p>So what the President heard from the parish presidents -- and the Coast Guard spent time with the parish presidents yesterday; Admiral Landry did -- is making sure that they have the resources that they need to deal with how and where that oil is moving, and as much as we can, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard folks say, how do we keep that out of the nutrient-rich estuaries and marshes that we all know once the oil gets in there, it\xe2\x80\x99s exceedingly hard to clean up.</p>\n<p>Q Is there a reason he didn\'t go -- the beach that he went to today, do you know how that was chosen and why he didn\'t go to a beach that was more soiled with oil or, you know, birds with -- covered with oil, or that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think most of the birds that are -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on the geography of that.\xc2\xa0 My sense is from many of the pictures that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from places like CNN, those are islands that are more -- I think a lot of those places, you have to get in a boat to go to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This was -- we wanted to go to a little bit different section of the state.\xc2\xa0 You obviously saw -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an economic impact that\'s different from simply coastal fisheries in that you see in a place like Grand Isle, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty bit tourism impact.\xc2\xa0 That tourism impact is being felt in Mississippi and in Alabama and in Florida as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President -- we just went to a different place.\xc2\xa0 You know you saw that -- obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s always -- you saw the equipment that was out there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly some natural seepage in that, but you see that in those tar balls, that that stuff is beginning to wash up.</p>\n<p>Q What does he want to do with family over the weekend, real quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to want to see some friends that he has -- some he\xe2\x80\x99s seen and some he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen.\xc2\xa0 I think the family is going to have a get-together and have some friends over for dinner and just sort of be in the old neighborhood for a couple of days, and then go to -- go back to the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s cemetery in Will County that he visited in 2005 on Memorial Day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We better sit down because we\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>Q The detonation we heard prior to take-off -- we heard a detonation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, that was a -- as I understand it, it was the stairs for the plane, there\xe2\x80\x99s a truck and the tire on the truck popped.\xc2\xa0 It was not a -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you in a minute if it was an Air Force One tire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>(Air Force One lands.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n5:06 P.M. CDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
