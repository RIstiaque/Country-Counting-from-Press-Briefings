Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:27 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I just had one announcement to make.\xc2\xa0 To honor the victims of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s horrific shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, the President will attend a memorial service on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 We will provide more details as they become available, but I wanted you to know that today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we know where that would be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, more details about the time, the specific time on Sunday, and where the service will be will become available soon.\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted to let you know today that the President will be attending a memorial service for the victims, on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak or just attend?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on that.\xc2\xa0 The President will want to mourn the loss of these innocent victims and share in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s pain in the aftermath of another senseless mass shooting.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Now that we have a clear sense of the trajectory in the House on their budget plan, does the administration think the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking this approach and the fact that they are probably not going to vote, it sounds, until Friday, does that make the possibility of a government shutdown more likely at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hope not.\xc2\xa0 But as I think we saw in the reporting today, House Republicans have decided to pursue a path away from the center, away from compromise, in favor of voting on a piece of legislation that they know will not become law.\xc2\xa0 And one sobering paragraph I read in one story about this, I think in the Washington Post, was that members of both parties are becoming increasingly worried that the fact that a faction of the House of Representatives, the House Republicans, is driving this thing in the wrong direction could bring us closer to a wholly unnecessary and damaging shutdown of the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And Congress has some basic responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 One of them is to fund the government, the operations of the government, and it is not to attach ideological aspirations to the kinds of bills that ensure that the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shut down and that we don\xe2\x80\x99t inflict another unnecessary wound on our economy just as it\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to grow and continuing to create jobs.</p>\n<p>And what has become more and more apparent is that the leaders of the Republican Party in Congress may want to avoid a shutdown and may want to avoid, even worse, a default.\xc2\xa0 But there are members of that party, especially in the House, who seem to embrace the prospect.\xc2\xa0 And the irony is that they are doing it in the name of trying to defund or delay, or defeat in some other way, a law designed to provide access to insurance for millions of Americans -- to health insurance -- a law that is already providing tangible benefits to millions of Americans; a law, as I said the other day, that when implemented will ensure that at least close to 6 in 10 uninsured Americans will now have the capability of buying insurance for less than $100 a month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That law was passed by the House, it was passed by the Senate, it was signed by the President, and it was upheld by the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And yet, in order to refight this political battle, some members of the Republican Party in Congress seem to want to shut down the government and maybe have, for the first time in the history of this great country, see the United States fail to pay the bills that it\xe2\x80\x99s already incurred.</p>\n<p>So this is a problem.\xc2\xa0 And we have to be crystal clear about the fact that there is a majority in Washington, a member of which is the President of the United States, a member of which is every Democrat on Capitol Hill, and a member of which are many Republicans on Capitol Hill, who do not want to see the government shut down, who do not want to see the pain inflicted that a shutdown would inflict on the middle class, and will not negotiate over the ideological aspirations of a small group or a -- unfortunately, not that small group, but a faction within the Republican Party in the House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the dynamic that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, does the White House feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that the President can do at this point to change that dynamic, or are you largely powerless to let this play out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you heard the President talk today at the Business Roundtable about the need for common sense to prevail here.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear that, in both the words that he has spoken and in the proposals that he has made, that he is willing to reach common ground when it comes to budget policy.\xc2\xa0 And he has had numerous conversations with Republican lawmakers in pursuit of that common ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the very least, Congress needs to move forward with a bill that continues the functioning of the federal government and then do what Congress has done hundreds of times in the past, without drama and without threat to the economy, and simply extend the debt ceiling so that the bills Congress racked up can be paid.</p>\n<p>The debt ceiling, I know, is often viewed as a vote over spending, but it is not.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t increase the deficit -- by raising the debt ceiling, you don\xe2\x80\x99t increase the deficit by a dime.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t add new spending.\xc2\xa0 All you are doing is telling Congress that the bills it has already incurred can be paid.\xc2\xa0 Must be paid.\xc2\xa0 And Congress needs to make sure that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, though, is we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard comments from the President this week, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard similar comments from him in previous budget fights.\xc2\xa0 So I guess what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is, is there anything more than just talking that the President and the White House can do at this point to change this dynamic on the Hill, which at this point seems to make it more likely that we are going to have a shutdown.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we are speaking out.\xc2\xa0 We are engaging in Washington, and we will continue to make the case that, while it is absolutely true that we have real differences and differences that are honestly come by among ourselves, between Democrats and Republicans, and we should debate those issues and hash them out, and try to reach a compromise, we cannot hold hostage the full faith and credit of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 We cannot and should not shut down the government in order to make an ideological point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I saw one Republican House member quoted in the paper saying, all that matters is that my constituents are for this.\xc2\xa0 And my question to him would be, will they be for it when, in the wake of the devastation of default, they can say, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a job because the economy is cratering, but thank God you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken away my opportunity to buy health insurance.\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, ahead of the Syria thing on the Hill, you guys were talking to everybody -- the President was on the phone, Denis McDonough was up on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing that in this case.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have been meeting with Republicans all year long over our budget challenges and our efforts to try to find common ground, and we will continue to work with Congress in the days and weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, I mean, it is -- to ask the question, do you think that meeting with President Obama is going to prevent House Republicans from what they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to do, which is to -- for the leadership to ignore their own wishes, not to lead, but to then say, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the will of 40 House Republicans who want to attach the funding of government to a bill that will never pass, never become law, to strip away funding for Obamacare -- that, in the end, Republicans in the Congress need to make a decision about what outcomes they really desire here.</p>\n<p>One provision related to the Affordable Care Act, that Republicans have pressed or said they might press when it comes to raising the debt ceiling, would increase the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s remember, the Affordable Care Act reduces the deficit significantly.\xc2\xa0 And trying to repeal it in a backhanded way or a side way, through delaying a central provision of it, would increase the deficit.\xc2\xa0 So in the name of fiscal conservatism, these Republicans would increase the deficit and call that a victory.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really square.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, are you willing to accept any delays in Obamacare in order to avoid a government shutdown?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The Congress passed the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The President signed it.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court upheld it as constitutional.\xc2\xa0 And it is providing benefits to millions of Americans today and will provide access to affordable health care to millions of Americans when the marketplaces take effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Republicans seem to believe -- or that faction of Republicans who have entertained this seem to believe that taking away those benefits is good messaging, is good politics.\xc2\xa0 What it is beyond that, if they believe that, is harmful to the people who have those benefits, harmful to our economy.\xc2\xa0 And they can, as they have 40 times already, continue to vote to repeal or change or defund the Affordable Care Act, and we can all watch that exercise as it unfolds.\xc2\xa0 But they should not harm average folks out there in order to participate in that exercise.\xc2\xa0 They should do their jobs by making sure that the essential functions of government are funded and making sure that the full faith and credit of the United States government is upheld, as it has been since the birth of the nation.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, so are we looking at sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cGridlock-Nado,\xe2\x80\x9d where we could have the government shut down at the end of the month and then go into default a couple of weeks later?\xc2\xa0 Is that a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about the NATO part of it, but the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe a better term, then.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It depends on what Republicans really want to achieve here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s possible?\xc2\xa0 The government could shut down and then go into default?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that Congress is the body responsible for passing legislation to fund the government, and body responsible for passing legislation to ensure that the debt ceiling is raised so that the bills Congress has already racked up are paid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if Congress fails to act, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 Leaders of Congress in both parties have said they would never allow the United States to default.\xc2\xa0 We saw just a few years ago when even the possibility of default was in the air, and when some House Republicans enthusiastically flirted with the idea of default, what that meant for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It did harm to our economy, did harm to our recovery.\xc2\xa0 One can only imagine what would happen if they did it again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Leaders say they don\xe2\x80\x99t want that to happen.\xc2\xa0 John Boehner, in March, told Sean Hannity that he thought it would be -- that threatening to shut down the government -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not even talking about default -- but shutting down the government over Obamacare was a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said in March.\xc2\xa0 Today, he\xe2\x80\x99s I guess reacting to the will of 40 members of the House who insist that it is a good idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we know the President has had dinner with various Senate Republicans and met with them privately over the last several months.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that with House Republican leaders.\xc2\xa0 Has he just given up on dealing with the House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has met many times with the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s met many times with other members of the House of Representatives, of the Republican Party, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the outreach has not been the same.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, again, the President has looked for -- the President laid forth a budget that represented compromise when it came to entitlement reform, something that Republicans said they want but they never talk about now because what they really want is to defund Obamacare and take away health insurance options from the American people and maybe raise the deficit at the same time.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what they said they wanted, so the President put it forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He put forward a comprehensive budget proposal that deals with our debt and deficit in the long term while funding important aspects -- while providing funds for investments that will help our economy grow, make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re building our infrastructure, educating our children, and conducting research and doing development in a way that keeps our economy competitive.</p>\n<p>A lot of Democrats did not love that proposal because it represented compromise; it represented a willingness to take less than the ideal by the President.\xc2\xa0 And he met -- he said, my door is open; anybody who wants to meet with me to talk about finding common ground -- Republicans that is, as well as Democrats -- are welcome.\xc2\xa0 And we had a lot constructive meetings.\xc2\xa0 But what we never saw from even the Republicans who said they were interested in common ground was a counter proposal, one that represented the same kind of willingness to compromise as the President had put forward.</p>\n<p>And that\'s what the American people expect us to do here.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they sent their representatives to do here, was to work out their differences, reach principled compromises, and take action to ensure that our economy continues to grow, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in the right places, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re responsibly reducing our deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, the deficit arguments are important, but I would point out that you don\'t hear them a lot anymore from Republicans because the deficit will now be cut in half over the time that the President has been in office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you say to Americans who see this and say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this movie before -- the government did not technically default the last time; there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a shutdown while President Obama has been in office, that this is just sort of Washington theater?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly hope and the President certainly hopes that sooner rather than later, Republican leaders in Congress will be willing to do the right thing and responsibly continue funding of the essential functions of the federal government and, without drama, as they did earlier this year, extend the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And then we can continue to negotiate over a broader budget compromise.\xc2\xa0 And they can continue to vote again and again and again to defund or repeal Obamacare in the House as we go about the business of providing expanded opportunities to Americans to get health insurance.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay, when was the last time the President had a substantive discussion with Speaker of the House John Boehner about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got this question yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think Speaker Boehner is very much engaged in trying to deal with what everybody in your business has accurately reported as essentially an all-out civil war within the Republican Party, where a faction of the party is basically at odds with the leadership and making demands that, if acquiesced to, could lead us to a shutdown or, even worse, to a default.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House strategy simply to lean back and watch this, as you call it, Republican civil war --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think you saw the President of the United States meeting with business leaders from this country today, business leaders who have no small amount of influence over leaders in Washington, including, you might say, especially Republican leaders about the need for responsible compromise when it comes to our budgeting and responsible action by Congress when it comes simply to extending the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And I think those leaders would tell you that even threatening default is unwise.</p>\n<p>And even as John Boehner said in March to Sean Hannity, threatening to shut down the government over Obamacare is a bad idea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess the question really is this question of giving up, because --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 We are making our points every day.\xc2\xa0 See, on Monday --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re making your points, but are you actually talking to Republicans?\xc2\xa0 You may make the argument, look, they\'re completely unreasonable --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I assume there are some watching now.\xc2\xa0 And there were a bunch of Republicans in the room with the President today, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing, right?\xc2\xa0 A bunch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Members of the House -- to pass this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Highly influential, card-carrying Republican Party members who have the ear of Republican lawmakers and who believe that Congress ought to do the responsible thing, which is not shut down the government and not allow the government to default.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your position -- let me just be crystal clear.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is you will not negotiate over the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is that tenable?\xc2\xa0 So the White House is really willing to risk default --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The White House is not -- here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but you\xe2\x80\x99re threatening default.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, Jon --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you won\xe2\x80\x99t even negotiate with Republicans on this issue.\xc2\xa0 How is that tenable?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, who has the power to raise the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 Who has the power to raise the debt ceiling?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Congress does --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Who has the power to raise the debt ceiling?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Republican Congress have put forward a plan --\xc2\xa0 you may call it ridiculous, whatever you want to call it -- but they have put forth a plan for raising the debt ceiling --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Congress has the power to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and you are unwilling to negotiate.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I like turning the tables here -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a direct answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The Congress has the power to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did answer you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I said they put forward a plan.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All they have to do is do what they have done hundreds of times before and raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 What is the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 The debt ceiling is not new spending.\xc2\xa0 Raising the debt ceiling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add a dime to the deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can I get a question?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the rhetoric around it suggests that it has to do with new spending, but as everyone in this room understands and everybody on Capitol Hill understands, and I believe a lot of Americans who are paying attention understand, this is simply a vote to allow Congress to pay the bills that Congress has already incurred.\xc2\xa0 And that is something we have done as a nation for every year of our existence.</p>\n<p>So what the President has said and what John Boehner periodically has publically agreed with is we cannot hold the full faith and credit of the United States government hostage to the ideological desires of a faction of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And it is incumbent upon the leaders of that party to ensure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, because though he would like to be able to give direction to members of the Republican Party in the House, the President can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, the elected leaders of the party in the House can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you won\xe2\x80\x99t event negotiate on the issue.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the debt ceiling has been raised -- you\xe2\x80\x99re right -- countless times, but there\xe2\x80\x99s often been a give-and-take.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not on the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Remind me how Senator Obama voted in 2006 on the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And we have addressed this many times, and there was never a threat of default then.\xc2\xa0 What the debt ceiling has been attached to again and again and again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He refused to vote for raising the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the debt ceiling -- because Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to take the vote, because they knew it was their responsibility to ensure that the debt ceiling would be raised, would attach the provision that raised the debt ceiling to other bills that were going to pass anyway, and that is what would happen.\xc2\xa0 And what we had never seen before in our history is what we saw in 2011 when the newly empowered leaders of the Republican Party in Congress insisted that we negotiate over raising the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>And we all saw, and you reported on, what happened when they flirted with actual default as opposed to protest votes, as opposed to attaching the debt ceiling to some other piece of legislation and holding their noses and voting for it.\xc2\xa0 This is qualitatively different -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no arguing that.\xc2\xa0 2011 was different from any other occasion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen when the debt ceiling has come to a vote, and it has severe economic consequences.\xc2\xa0 We cannot allow that to happen again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is willing to negotiate over budget policy.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to negotiate over how we reduce our deficit further moving forward, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced it significantly since he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to negotiate over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental responsibility not to default on its obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this just semantics, though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be willing to negotiate on those things and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said all along and we have negotiated all year long over how we pass a budget.\xc2\xa0 The Senate said -- I mean, the Republicans in Congress said, as part of the end-of-the-year deal, New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day deal, that they insisted -- that one of their demands was that the Senate pass a budget just as the House had been passing budgets and that normal, regular order would prevail.\xc2\xa0 So we said, yes.\xc2\xa0 The President said, yes.\xc2\xa0 Democratic leaders in the Senate said, yes.\xc2\xa0 All of that happened.\xc2\xa0 And then, when it happened and Republicans got what they wanted, they walked away from the process.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re willing and have been willing to negotiate over how we can responsibly reduce our deficit, how we can responsibly reduce the cost of entitlements over time -- how we can do all that in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair and helpful to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 But what we won\xe2\x80\x99t do, what the President will not do, what he cannot do is negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That should be an absolute certitude that Congress will not default.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to return to an earlier point, all he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing is talking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to what?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he twist somebody\xe2\x80\x99s arm?\xc2\xa0 Twist some arms.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Bill, you know what he did?\xc2\xa0 He wrote a budget.\xc2\xa0 And he proposed it, and he sent it to Congress in detail -- detail we have not seen from the Republicans -- and in response, in return, in terms of a compromise proposition.\xc2\xa0 And he sat down again and again and again with members of the Republican Party in Congress who said they were interested in trying to find a deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the 14th century, it\xe2\x80\x99s been known that it\xe2\x80\x99s better to be loved than -- I mean, feared than loved when it comes to these things.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Probably prior to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, okay.\xc2\xa0 But why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he done some more arm-twisting, for example?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to kneecaps, but arm-twisting?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has twisted arms.\xc2\xa0 He has used the powers that are available to him to try to convince, persuade, cajole Republicans into doing the sensible thing, which is not threatening to shut the government, not threatening to default, but working with him on a compromise.\xc2\xa0 And what they said they wanted when it came to some of their demands on entitlement reforms, he gave.\xc2\xa0 And then they walked away and didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back.</p>\n<p>So at some point, you have to have a negotiating partner who is willing to -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to compromise, they have to be willing to compromise, too.\xc2\xa0 And instead, what we have in the House now is a situation where the House leadership indicates a reasonable approach to making sure the government shuts down and the rank-and-file members say no, so the House leadership says nevermind.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we cannot -- as much as we would like to be in charge of the House Republicans, we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not how the system works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So basically you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s not to blame at all?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the other guy\xe2\x80\x99s fault?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s his responsibility to offer compromises, and he has.\xc2\xa0 It is also absolutely the right position to take that he and no President should negotiate over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to pay its bills.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can he afford to remain above the fray like this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re assuming that he\xe2\x80\x99s above the fray.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in the fray.\xc2\xa0 And he was in the fray today, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the fray until Congress does the right thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With talks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to what, Bill?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll take up arms, okay?\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to -- this is going to have to be worked out, and Congress is going to have to act.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you told Jon the debt ceiling is never attached to anything, don\'t you find that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said the opposite.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s not attached to other issues, that the Congress does it as a stand-alone.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said that in the past, in order to mitigate the unpleasantness of voting for raising the debt ceiling, it has been attached to other bills that aren\xe2\x80\x99t germane that were going to pass so that the debt ceiling has been raised.\xc2\xa0 And that has been used as an example by the Speaker of times when the debt ceiling itself -- raising the debt ceiling itself has been negotiated over, which until 2011 had not been the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But based on 2011, at that podium, you often take credit for $2 trillion in spending cuts the President got that were attached to the last debt ceiling fight.\xc2\xa0 So when you get something you want, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s something about health care or whatever, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing.\xc2\xa0 You tout that you got $2 trillion --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President puts forward a proposal to reduce the deficit beyond what was included in that deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but do you think that was a good thing?\xc2\xa0 You got $2 trillion --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we don\'t think the sequester was a good thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about sequester.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sequester was part of that deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Part of that deal.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve touted again and again $2 trillion --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 $1.2 trillion --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The sequester is a small part of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not $2 trillion.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You got to go back and check your facts.\xc2\xa0 The initial reduction in non-defense discretionary spending that was part of that deal was roughly $1.2 trillion.\xc2\xa0 Josh, am I right?\xc2\xa0 Along those lines?\xc2\xa0 A trillion bucks.\xc2\xa0 And that represented a compromise between the President and the Republicans.</p>\n<p>Then the super committee was tasked with coming up with additional deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And if it did not and if Congress failed to act in the ensuing years to come up with a more responsibly achieved deficit reduction in a balanced way, as the President saw it, then the sequester would kick in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve never said that the sequester itself was good policy or that we take credit for it.\xc2\xa0 Far from it.\xc2\xa0 The President has long said the right and responsible thing to do would be to reduce our deficit in a balanced way so that the burden of deficit reduction does not fall solely on the shoulders of the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you say it\xe2\x80\x99s such a bad thing for the Republicans to want to delay the health care implementation, the President has delayed pieces of the law.\xc2\xa0 And you said that was a smart way to do it, we need to more slowly implement it, help businesses deal with it.\xc2\xa0 So if the Republicans come up with it, why is it such a bad idea if they say let\xe2\x80\x99s slow-walk some pieces of this, and when you do it, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly fine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you did, right?\xc2\xa0 On the businesses, you said they can delay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the employer responsibility provision, which represents a very small portion of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, it was the right and responsible thing to do, reacting in part to the requests of businesses to delay implementation of that for a year.</p>\n<p>As every Republican who is pushing the idea of delaying implementation of the individual responsibility provision, they know that that is the heart of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 It is what is essential to ensuring that everyone in your extended family who has a preexisting condition can still get health insurance and isn\xe2\x80\x99t blackballed by the insurance companies to making that work, making sure that the individual responsibility provision is there.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, delaying it would do what?\xc2\xa0 Add to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 So in the name of deficit reduction, Republicans are saying we should add to the deficit, even as we\xe2\x80\x99re taking away health care for millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 Seems like a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other quick things.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve a couple of times mentioned that John Boehner, in March, said that shutting down the government is a bad idea, and now apparently --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Over Obamacare, specifically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 Over that, specifically.\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s changed his mind.\xc2\xa0 The President changed his mind on Syria.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad thing; he thought it was smart -- go to Congress.<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.\xc2\xa0 These are the facts you\xe2\x80\x99ve been presenting every day at this podium for the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 He was not going to go to Congress to vote on Syria, then he changed his mind.\xc2\xa0 Everyone here says it\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea.\xc2\xa0 He slowed everything down.\xc2\xa0 John Boehner changed his mind.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because shutting down the government over Obamacare is a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 Going to Congress to seek an authorization for the use of military force --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That he can\xe2\x80\x99t get now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- was a good idea according to hundreds of members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a vote.\xc2\xa0 Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the arguments you\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xc2\xa0 I see oranges and I see apples, but I don\'t see --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you then -- let me ask you about a specific thing on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Last night there was a forum where two of the President\xe2\x80\x99s former Defense Secretaries, Mr. Panetta and Mr. Gates were there.\xc2\xa0 They both said going to Congress to authorize force was a bad idea, number one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Number two, Mr. Gates said, even though I know previously he\xe2\x80\x99s put out a statement saying he supports a mission in Syria, he said that air strikes would be \xe2\x80\x9cthrowing gasoline on a very complex fire,\xe2\x80\x9d and he went on to say, my bottom line is if you blow up a bunch of stuff over a couple of days, to validate a point or principle, is not a strategy.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that, a former Defense Secretary?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, the President does believe that it was the right thing to do -- given that there was not an imminent threat to the United States, given that military action -- the success of military action was not dependent on acting immediately, and therefore there was time to allow debate in Congress -- that Congress should be consulted and Congress should be given the right to vote on authorization.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about that.\xc2\xa0 Others can disagree, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but the President believes it was the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it was precisely because of the credible threat of U.S. military action that we saw Syria do an about-face -- a nation that had -- or a government that had refused to acknowledge that it even possessed chemical weapons, and for 20 years had refused to be a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, one of the very few nations on Earth to refuse to sign that, utterly change its position on both issues within days because of the credible threat of U.S. military action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The same is true for Russia, which had -- prior to their adoption of this proposal to have Syria give up its chemical weapons, turn them over to international supervision and be signatories to the CWC -- had acted aggressively to block all efforts to hold Assad accountable.</p>\n<p>Now, there is a diplomatic avenue available to achieving the President\xe2\x80\x99s goals that allow -- without the use of military force -- and the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do to pursue it.\xc2\xa0 That avenue opened up because of the threat of force.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, as well as others, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to make clear that the threat of force remains on the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>None of these issues are easy.\xc2\xa0 None of the decisions that a leader makes in these circumstances are obvious or clear.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is hard to argue that we are not globally in a better place when it comes to Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons today than we were three weeks ago -- when Syria had used chemical weapons against its own people, when Syria denied that it even possessed chemical weapons, when Syria refused to be a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, and certainly had not even entertained publicly the idea of giving up its chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we have a long way to travel on this road and a lot of work to do and a lot of verification to achieve.\xc2\xa0 But the positions the President took helped bring us to this point, which is a better point than where we were in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Ann Curry sat down for an exclusive interview with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s President Rouhani today in Tehran.\xc2\xa0 I know we addressed this briefly yesterday, but I just want to follow up and make sure I get it on the record again today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to meet with the Iranian President during the United Nations meetings in New York next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are currently no plans for the President to meet with President Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran, and we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have heard a lot in the world from President Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s administration about its desire to improve the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the international community.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama believes we should test that assertion, and we are and we will do that.</p>\n<p>As you know, the President mentioned in an interview with George Stephanopoulos that he and President Rouhani have exchanged letters, and in his letter the President indicated that the U.S. is ready to resolve the nuclear issue in a way that allows Iran to demonstrate that its nuclear program is for exclusively peaceful purposes.\xc2\xa0 The letter also conveyed the need to act with a sense of urgency to address this issue, because as we have long said, the window of opportunity for resolving this diplomatically is open, but it will not remain open indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in that event that was held last night, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta\xc2\xa0 also said that the President should have directed limited action in Syria.\xc2\xa0 He went on to say that Iran is paying very close attention to what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing -- \xe2\x80\x9dThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question in my mind they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the situation, and what they are seeing is an element of weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is Leon Panetta wrong in that assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 I have enormous respect, the President has enormous respect and appreciation for both of his former Secretaries of Defense, but as your two questions noted, they actually disagree on this issue, which only reinforces the fact that these are not easy decisions to make or easy positions to take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that the credible threat of military force was important and remains important, and that it has brought about this potential for a diplomatic resolution.\xc2\xa0 He believes it was the right thing to do to go to Congress for authorization prior to the diplomatic breakthrough.\xc2\xa0 And he understands that others can differ with that view; that others might say he or any President should have deployed military force without going to Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believed, consistent with the principles he has espoused since he was a candidate for President, that given the fact that there was not an imminent threat to the United States and given that the military response that he was calling for could be executed successfully even if there was a delay allowing for congressional debate, that it was the right thing to do to go to Congress.\xc2\xa0 He understood and made clear when he made his announcement in the Rose Garden that this would be a tough debate.\xc2\xa0 And that does not take away from the fact that it was a good debate and the right debate to have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly, on the topic of the shooting that took place only a few miles from here at the Navy Yard.\xc2\xa0 The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey, today said, "Those who have served in the military should not be stigmatized by having to answer questions about their mental health status on security clearance forms.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Acknowledging there\xe2\x80\x99s a review in place right now, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on whether there should be greater mental health checks done, more information provided by people that want to become contractors in that forum?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a review taking place -- one that has been ongoing with regard to some contractors that is being undertaken by the ODNI and then another that is being undertaken by the Office of Management and Budget here, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to dictate what the outcomes of that review should be.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an issue, broadly speaking, separate from matters of clearances -- but broadly speaking when it comes to gun violence, there\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that is important to examine when it comes to mental health.\xc2\xa0 And that was something the President talked about when he put forward his comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence and it is something that he believes is important to talk about today.\xc2\xa0 How that plays into security clearances and work clearances for contractors I think we should wait and see once these reviews are done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given what you\xe2\x80\x99ve described as the obstructionist bent that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from some congressional Republicans, would you say that the -- does the President believe that the best way to achieve his second-term goals might be through the midterm elections and putting in a Democratic -- getting a Democratic Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is not waiting to achieve any of these goals, to push for the achievement of any of these goals that help create a better bargain for the middle class, that help making the middle class stronger through broad economic growth and job creation, through education investment and investment in research and development, and new energy and infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s put forward these proposals.\xc2\xa0 He put forward his compromise proposals on the budget.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s continued to press leaders in Congress to take him up in discussion and debate about moving forward on these issues.\xc2\xa0 That includes his tax reform proposal, coupling corporate tax reform with investments in infrastructure and job creation.\xc2\xa0 So he is throwing out ideas to try to see if he can move the ball forward when it comes to growing our economy, and he is going to continue doing that.</p>\n<p>A term in office for the President may, to some, seem like a long time -- four years -- but there is much work to be done, and he is not going to wait for elections or changes in the seasons to try to move forward.\xc2\xa0 He has been pushing this ball uphill, sometimes frequently, from the day he took office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted on this five-year anniversary of the financial collapse, there has been a great deal achieved.\xc2\xa0 Remembering where we were five years ago is to almost reinsert yourself into a nightmare when you think back about the fears that everyone was dealing with in September of 2008 and for the next 18 months, really, at least.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s important as we do that to remember that many millions of Americans are still struggling and we need to make the right decisions to insert -- to make sure that the economy grows and more good-paying, middle-class jobs are created; 7.5 million is a lot, but it is not nearly enough.\xc2\xa0 We need to press on.</p>\n<p>Anybody?\xc2\xa0 Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this year, the President had a real --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When do you go to London?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 January.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got me for a few more months yet.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Well, make sure I get an invitation to the going-away party.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 The President had a real charm offensive with Republicans -- he took them to dinner, he paid out of pocket, he went to a nice restaurant.\xc2\xa0 Is the difference between that approach a few months ago and this sort of going to business leaders and speaking publicly instead of courting Republicans in person, does that reflect a sense in the White House that the charm offensive failed, that the wooing them didn\xe2\x80\x99t work?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have tried and we will try all manner of ways to get to yes with Republican leaders when it comes to doing the responsible thing on budget policy and on raising the debt ceiling, and on a bunch of other issues like immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that while it was notable that the President footed the bill for a very expensive dinner at a very nice restaurant in a lovely hotel up the street here, there were many other meetings with the President, and with the Chief of Staff, and with the Vice President, and others, with lawmakers, well into the year, and all around this effort of trying to find common ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that what we discovered is that there is a sincere desire by Republican lawmakers -- some of them, anyway, and not an insignificant number of them -- to try to work out a way to make budget policy and economic policy that reduces the deficit responsibly but invests responsibly as well, and in a way that is fair to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And the President remains hopeful that those members who sincerely want to achieve that will be able to -- working with him and working with Democrats.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep pressing, at the very least when it comes to these deadlines, that Washington not inflict harm on the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We may not be able to achieve the big deal when it comes to a long-term budget with Congress between now and October 1st, but we certainly shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t therefore allow -- and the Republicans in the House should not insist upon -- shutting down the government over that, over the fact that Obamacare is the law of the land and it\xe2\x80\x99s being implemented, and it has been upheld by the Supreme Court, and it\xe2\x80\x99s providing benefits to millions of people.</p>\n<p>I understand that they -- we understand that those Republicans who feel adamantly about this oppose the law, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve campaigned on it, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve voted on it, but they should not then pair it with shutting down the government or defaulting on our obligations.</p>\n<p>Phil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, first on Kathy Ruemmler.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any opinion on her leaving?\xc2\xa0 Is there any kind of timetable to replace her in the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can confirm that she will be leaving at the end of the year, so she is here for a good bit longer, and that the President had asked her to stay on as long as she has and will, and that she is an enormous asset and a very important advisor to the President, and one of the smartest people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met and one of the best people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked with.\xc2\xa0 So we will all be sad to see her go when she goes.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I have no information to provide, as ever, on personnel decisions by the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he identified a successor, or is this going to take time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have no information to divulge on that matter or any other personnel matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on immigration --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As long as you\'re asking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I wanted to ask on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President said in the Telemundo interview that he was not going to use executive authority to delay deportations of illegal immigrants.\xc2\xa0 Some immigration advocates wish he would do more while Congress is still sort of kind of stalled out on this bill.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has made clear is that comprehensive immigration reform is the way to resolve our immigration challenges.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to this matter of deportations and the idea that there\'s a plan B available to him, he said yesterday in the interview that you cited that it\'s not an option.\xc2\xa0 He said, "That to do so would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an option."</p>\n<p>If John Boehner, going back to the Speaker of the House, would put the Senate comprehensive immigration bill on the floor of the House today, it would pass and the President would sign it.\xc2\xa0 We\'re confident of that.\xc2\xa0 There is a majority not only in the nation, but even in Congress to achieve this important piece of legislation that would grow our economy and reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 It would provide a system to allow for the best and the brightest from other countries who study here to stay here and start businesses here, and would ensure that everybody is playing by the same set of rules -- whether it\'s employers or people working in the United States, that they\'re paying their taxes and contributing to the common good.</p>\n<p>So the President believes that the House ought to do that.\xc2\xa0 He is entirely confident that comprehensive immigration reform will pass, will become law, and that he will be the one who signs it into law.\xc2\xa0 And the House ought to do it right away and maybe address some of the political challenges that they\'ve been encountering lately by doing so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jumping back to Aaron Alexis, does the White House have any sense for how sequestration budget cuts are affecting/have affected the background clearance check process?\xc2\xa0 And has that had any impact on this case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the investigation and the FBI, who are making assessments about this particular case.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not aware of any impacts one way or the other of sequestration on background check systems or security systems.\xc2\xa0 These are all under review as a general matter by the DNI and by the OMB.\xc2\xa0 And I imagine that that piece of it will be taken into account.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Netanyahu said yesterday that the way to end the Iranian nuclear crisis was for Iran to stop enriching uranium, to ship out the uranium that it\xe2\x80\x99s enriched out of the country, to close Qom, and to stop plutonium activity.</p>\n<p>The President yesterday said in his interview that the way for it to end would be for Iran not to weaponize its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Does that not show that despite the good feeling of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Israel earlier this year, that the two sides are still deeply divided on the fundamental way to stop this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think -- I mean, both are ways for Iran to resolve its obligations to the international community when it comes to nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 Any resolution would have to come through a verifiable compliance and a verifiable commitment by Iran to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0 That has long been our position.\xc2\xa0 So again, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to talk in the P5-plus-1, as well as bilaterally, with Iran if Iran is willing to engage substantively on this matter.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 What are the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on for the first time an Indian American winning the Miss America beauty pageant?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken about it with him, so I don\'t have his thoughts.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s great, personally.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he aware of the racial slurs she is facing after she won the beauty pageant?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he aware about the racial aspect --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed that with him, so I don\'t have a presidential response.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:17 P.M.
