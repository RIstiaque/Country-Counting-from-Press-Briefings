EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Let me just do a short topper on the event today, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, the President will deliver remarks to approximately 3,000 servicemembers and Department of Defense civilians, including some who have recently returned home from Afghanistan, serving at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, one of America\xe2\x80\x99s premier joint bases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>During his remarks, the President will express his gratitude for their service and sacrifice, and call on all Americans to remember them and their families during this holiday season.\xc2\xa0 As the nation\xe2\x80\x99s only tri-service joint base -- active duty, reserve, and guard servicemembers of the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard -- it ensured total force integration by training, supporting and sustaining global contingency operations.\xc2\xa0 The base spans about 42,000 acres in Burlington and Ocean County, New Jersey, supporting approximately 44,000 of America\xe2\x80\x99s finest who live, work and train there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And just a little update about congressional participation.\xc2\xa0 At the event today will be Senator Booker and Senator Menendez, as well as Congressman-elect Tom MacArthur, Congressman Donald Norcross, and Congressman Jon Runyan.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that Congressman Norcross is on the plane with us flying up there.\xc2\xa0 I also anticipate that Governor Christie will meet President Obama upon arrival and will also attend the event as well.</p>\n<p>So this I think is a pretty good illustration of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You buried the lead, Josh.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to.\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think that this sort of illustrates that this time of year, that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty easy to be bipartisan when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about supporting our men and women in uniform and their families.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, it should be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did Christie\xe2\x80\x99s participation take part?\xc2\xa0 How did it unfold?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, typically, when the President travels to a state, he\xe2\x80\x99s often -- but they\xe2\x80\x99re not always -- met on the tarmac by the home-state governor.\xc2\xa0 And so for an event like this, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to be bipartisan when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about showing our support to our men and women in uniform and their families, particularly around the holidays.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he travel to the event with the Governor in the motorcade?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re landing at the Air Force base, so if he does it will be a short trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is this a base that\xe2\x80\x99s also used as a launching area for Ebola troops?\xc2\xa0 And will the President refer to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there are any personnel from this particular military installation who were involved in this effort, but we can check on that.\xc2\xa0 But what there are, is there are individuals who are returning home after a tour of duty in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much discussion is underway about extending the timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan as a result of the recent violence in Kabul?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 None.\xc2\xa0 The President has made a clear decision and laid out a clear strategy for responsibly drawing down our troop presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And this is contingent upon the first Democratic transition of power in the history of the nation of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It involves the hammering out of the bilateral security agreement that has now been signed by the leaders of the two countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a similar agreement enacted between the government in Afghanistan and our NATO allies who play an important role there as well.</p>\n<p>So we are still on track, based on the strategy the President laid out, for winding down our troop presence in Afghanistan, and by the end of next year essentially withdrawing our military footprint substantially.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the situation in Australia?\xc2\xa0 Did the President speak with Prime Minister Abbott?\xc2\xa0 And how closely had you guys been monitoring everything that was been going on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell that last night and over the course of the morning and this afternoon, the President has been regularly updated on the situation in Australia.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s chief Counterterrorism Advisor, Lisa Monaco, has been responsible for ensuring that he is up to speed on the latest developments.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any presidential-level phone calls to read out at this point.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that as is customary in these sort of situations, the United States did offer some assistance and support to the Australians as they dealt with this particular scenario.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any presidential calls at this point to read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on bill signings, has there been any further decision-making on whether to sign the Russia sanctions bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you in terms of the thinking on this.\xc2\xa0 I know this is something that has been the source of some discussions at the White House over the last several days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as we talked about in the briefing on Friday, the legislative language changed a couple of times sort of in the run-up to its passage.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that we\'re still reviewing.\xc2\xa0 And if we have an update on this in the next couple of days, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the defense authorization bill -- timing on that?\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to presume he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my -- have they actually -- has that passed both the House and the Senate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told it has.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you for an update on this.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we traditionally sign every year, so I would anticipate that that would be the case this time as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that in the past there have been provisions included in the NDAA that interfered with the ability of this administration to move forward with the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of closing the prison in Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that similar language is in there that has raised concerns in the past.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I don\'t have any -- I guess I don\'t have a veto threat to issue at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President talk with Senator Menendez about the Russia sanctions bill since they\'re going to be together?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk about that.\xc2\xa0 I do think that Senator Menendez is planning to fly back with us to Washington.\xc2\xa0 I believe that Senator Booker is as well.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any conversations to preview with them at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, Dick Cheney continued sort of his strong defense of harsh interrogation practices by the CIA, saying that if he could do it, he would again in a minute.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the former Vice President was wrong in his categorization?\xc2\xa0 And did the President have a reaction to that language?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t speak to the President about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the former Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d this weekend.\xc2\xa0 But I can say unequivocally that the President certainly believes that the former Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment is wrong.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President on his second full day in office reversed the policy and unequivocally banned those tactics from ever being used again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President that the use of those tactics only serves to undermine the moral authority of the United States of America around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is -- and I think this is something that even Vice President Cheney would agree on -- is that our moral authority around the globe is an important tool in our arsenal for protecting and advancing America\xe2\x80\x99s interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to banning those tactics and the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to releasing the report are all part of the effort to continue the process of rebuilding that moral authority in a way that will enhance our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, by the time we had final passage on the $1.1 trillion spending bill over the weekend, some divisions became evident on both parties.\xc2\xa0 Do you all see similarities between the divisions within the Democratic Party that became evident and the ones in the Republican Party?\xc2\xa0 And has the President done any outreach to Senator Elizabeth Warren?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very important difference between the differing views that were expressed by members of the Democratic and Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 The difference on the Democratic side was one related to tactics not principle.\xc2\xa0 I think pretty much every Democrat disagreed -- well, that\'s an overstatement.\xc2\xa0 Many Democrats and certainly the President and some of the most outspoken opponents of this proposal shared the view that the specific provision related to watering down one element of Wall Street reform was not a good idea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The difference in tactics, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that it was important to sign this bill because the alternative was merely a three-month CR in which Democrats and Republicans on the Hill would come back and try to negotiate a budget three months from now.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is Republicans would actually have more leverage three months from now because they would have more representatives in both the House and the Senate when the new Congress takes office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President made a tactical decision to go ahead and support this piece of legislation because he believes, frankly, that it\'s better than the agreement that would be reached three months from now.\xc2\xa0 On the Republicans side, I do believe there was a difference of opinion, that there were some -- and a substantial number of Republicans who do believe that weakening Wall Street reform is somehow in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 The President sharply disagrees with that view.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I do believe that there is more of a difference of opinion on principle, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why many observers believe that some of the rifts that we see in the Republican Party are much deeper and, frankly, more consequential.\xc2\xa0 But I think this is a story that, frankly, will be told throughout the legislative process in 2015 and beyond as Republicans in both the House and the Senate figure out how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to assume the responsibility of essentially being in the majority and running both the House of Representatives and the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see Senator Warren as someone he has to reckon with over the next two years?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is going to continue to see Senator Warren as somebody that he can work with to protect the interest of middle-class families and to make sure that well-connected Wall Street firms, and others, aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to run roughshod over the regulatory process.\xc2\xa0 President Obama and Elizabeth Warren, both prior to her entry into the Senate and after, have worked effectively together to stand up for middle-class families, and whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the creation of the CFPB and the passage of Wall Street reform prior to her taking office, or even just last month when the President and Senator Warren spoke out together in opposition to the tax extenders package that was being negotiated in Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This was a package that would have substantially relieved the tax burden of well-connected corporations without offering much relief to working families.\xc2\xa0 That violated a basic principle of this President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for strengthening our economy and benefiting middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 Senator Warren had the same objections, and that was an example of the President and Senator Warren working together pretty effectively on behalf of middle-class families, and I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that kind of cooperation into the new year as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President agree to any further rollbacks in Dodd-Frank if needed to reach a compromise with Republicans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country for us to water down Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President has been working, and his administration has been working, to implement the Wall Street reform legislation since it was passed four years ago now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there has been a concerted effort to make sure that these regulations, as they\xe2\x80\x99re implemented, are implemented in a way that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a significant detrimental impact on the broader economy, but do actually hold Wall Street executives and Wall Street firms accountable for their conduct.\xc2\xa0 Never again do we want taxpayers to be on the hook for bailing out Wall Street reforms that make -- Wall Street firms that make risky bets that go south.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But banks that have now seen a success here, they may want to come back for more.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They may.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President -- and I think you can be confident that one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities is going to be protecting Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there now is a -- that the majority party in both the House and the Senate will be eager to do the bidding of those Wall Street firms.\xc2\xa0 And that makes it all the more important that the President is working closely with Democrats in Congress to fight back those efforts.</p>\n<p>And I do anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to expend some time and energy next year and the year after trying to counter the efforts of Wall Street firms and their lobbyists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think Senate is rolling back the D.C. marijuana provision.\xc2\xa0 I know you had said last week that the White House -- D.C. voters voted for it, it could go forward.\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?\xc2\xa0 And has the White House\xe2\x80\x99s stance on legalization changed at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The White House position as it relates to some of the voter actions on marijuana that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last few years hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 But the principal concern that we have with the legislative action in Congress from last week is because it violates the principle of home rule.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the voters of the District of Columbia sent a pretty clear signal about how they believe their community and their district should be governed, and the President does not believe it\'s appropriate for Congress to be interfering in those local activities in this way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President\xe2\x80\x99s stance on legalization changed at all, aside from voter initiatives?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it has not.</p>\n<p>All right, okay.\xc2\xa0 See you on the ground shortly, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks Josh.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:59 P.M.
