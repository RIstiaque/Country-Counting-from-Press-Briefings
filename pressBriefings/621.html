Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:31 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 Of course, I wanted to make sure that you heard the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at the end of his bilateral meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu, at which, in addition to his comments about the meeting, about our relationship with Israel, our unshakeable support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, the discussion the two leaders had about Syria and Iran and the Middle East peace process, among other things, the President took a question and answered it about the fact that as of now, it is up to the House of Representatives to decide whether or not they want to shut down the government in order to make an ideological point, or whether they will follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and pass an extension of government funding at current levels for a number of weeks so that we can get about the business of discussing and negotiating a long-term budget agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit more about what the President just said about having conversations with leaders on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 Did that include Speaker Boehner?\xc2\xa0 And is he making any progress in these talks for averting a shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President said what we\'ve said, which is that you can expect that he will be having conversations with leaders on the Hill, as he has in the past.\xc2\xa0 And I assume that would include the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe point I think, though, is that we are at a moment where the House of Representatives has to decide, and the Speaker of the House, as the leader of the House and the leader of House Republicans, must decide whether roughly 60 members of his caucus, the tea party faction, will dictate to the American people whether the government will shut down because they have not been able to achieve through normal means their ideological agenda, which is to repeal and do away with in some manner or other the Affordable Care Act -- the irony, of course, being that tomorrow enrollment begins in the Affordable Care Act, and millions of Americans for whom access to affordable insurance has been but a dream, there will be the opportunity to enroll in the Affordable Care Act through the exchanges and the marketplaces and receive, come January 1st, affordable health insurance for the first time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Nothing will alter that.\xc2\xa0 That will happen.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple follows to that.\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken yet to Speaker Boehner?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any other conversations or new conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President indicated is that he expects that he will, of course, speak with leaders in the coming days.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here to debate.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear all year long that he is willing and eager to negotiate over our budget priorities and to reach a common-sense solution to funding our government.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what his budget was about, which many of you wrote about and correctly assessed to represent a compromise.\xc2\xa0 And we have encouraged Republicans to show the same willingness to compromise all year long, and the President has met with many members of Congress of the Republican Party over the course of the year to have those discussions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat he will not do is go along with the idea that the government should be shut down over this desire to unwind history and achieve through threat and extortion what Republicans couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do through the legislative process or through the election process.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not fair to the American people, and it\'s not fair to the millions of Americans who will have access to affordable health insurance for the first time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto a continued resolution that only included a provision killing the medical device tax?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said that\xe2\x80\x99s -- none of this is acceptable.\xc2\xa0 This is just a blatant extortion.\xc2\xa0 And the irony about it is -- the Republicans will tell you -- the Republicans who support this extortion game or extortion racket will tell you that, oh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s compromise; we just want you to do this on the Affordable Care Act, and chip away at it here or delay there. And yet, they\'ll all also tell you quite clearly that the goal -- the ultimate goal and purpose of this is to do away with the Affordable Care Act, so take away all those benefits for millions of Americans, and increase the deficit dramatically while doing it -- something they never mention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut in the end, they want to do that for a continuing resolution that will fund the government for 45 days?\xc2\xa0 60 days?\xc2\xa0 What comes next?\xc2\xa0 What will they demand next?\xc2\xa0 I mean, part of it was they want everybody\'s boss to be able to tell them -- to tell every woman in America whether or not they can get contraceptive coverage.\xc2\xa0 They want to attach that to this debate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is not, as others have said, this is not the way Congress ought to operate, and it\'s irresponsible and reckless to hold the functioning of the government hostage to these ideological imperatives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that there\'s no sign of any movement, Jay, isn\'t a shutdown inevitable this evening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President said just now, and I certainly agree with him, that, no, that he is not resigned to a shutdown, because there\'s an avenue open to the House, after the Senate does what we expect, which is send back to the House a clean CR that just continues funding the government at current levels.\xc2\xa0 It contains no concessions to the democratic agenda or the President\'s agenda.\xc2\xa0 It just continues funding the government at current levels for a number of weeks in order to allow for the negotiations the President is eager to engage in.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the responsible thing to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe irresponsible thing to do is to attach a bunch of political ideological demands to this simple proposition of funding the government and not shutting it down, and say you\'ll shut it down if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get what you want.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not detecting any signs of any movement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I used to walk the halls of Congress as a reporter and, back then, knew a lot more about the minute-by-minute developments.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I did that during the last government shutdown here in \'95 and up there in \'96.\xc2\xa0 But I leave it to your colleagues to tell me more precisely what the thinking of the House Republican leadership is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How will a shutdown affect White House staffing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the White House, like other agencies within government, is affected.\xc2\xa0 There will be reductions in staff.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a skeletal staff.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously essential staff that\'s exempted -- or excepted, which I think is the proper term.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s true in other areas.\xc2\xa0 But it will be an extremely lean operation if this comes to pass.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, will he go on this trip to Asia this weekend?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have any changes to announce.\xc2\xa0 We plan to make this trip.\xc2\xa0 The President, as President, looks forward to and believes it is important to travel to Asia in order to promote our economic interests in Asia and our strategic interests in Asia.\xc2\xa0 There are American jobs that can be created through our engagement with Asia, the fastest-growing region of the world and an enormously important region when it comes to our trading relationships and partnerships.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we have this trip scheduled and we intend to take it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see, obviously, what happens as the week unfolds.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me move around a little bit if I may.\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on what Steve said.\xc2\xa0 You said there will be a skeletal staff and a lean operation indeed if the shutdown happened.\xc2\xa0 Could you get into the breakdown?\xc2\xa0 Could you give us numbers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Office of Management and Budget, which handles all of these specifics and can give you more information about how it breaks down.\xc2\xa0 But those of you who know if you\'re as old as I am and remember what it was like in the mid \xe2\x80\x9890s, and remember also what you reported just when there was at least the potential of a shutdown, there are significant reductions in staff and furloughs that take place here, as elsewhere, if a shutdown occurs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that staff that will be not coming in or furloughed will not be paid, correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s my understanding.\xc2\xa0 But I hesitate to answer these kind of technical questions because there are far better sources for that specific information.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And understanding that today that even the White House is trying to still parse through all the technicalities of the effects on the White House from a shutdown -- is that the case?\xc2\xa0 If so, could you talk to us about some of the things that you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 There are effects here and there are effects throughout the government.\xc2\xa0 But those pale in comparison to the effects and impacts that a shutdown would have on women and children and seniors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tShortly after a shutdown, if it were to occur, federal funding for the Women, Infants and Children program may not be sufficient to cover benefits, and agencies may have to cut off services to mothers and young children.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSenior nutrition grants, which help approximately 2.5 million seniors annually -- help them remain healthy and independent by providing meals and related services -- would not be funded.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPrograms that our nation\'s veterans depend on would be affected.\xc2\xa0 For example, veterans\xe2\x80\x99 call centers and regional offices would be closed immediately, effective immediately.\xc2\xa0 So those services that help veterans understand their benefits, including call centers, hotlines and regional offices, would be closed.\xc2\xa0 Vocational rehabilitation and education counseling for veterans would be limited.\xc2\xa0 Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 business support centers would be immediately closed.\xc2\xa0 And should a lapse extend through late October, compensation, pension, education and other veterans\' benefits would be cut off.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tImportant research and consumer safety programs would be halted in the event of a shutdown, including research into life-threatening diseases.\xc2\xa0 Work to protect consumers, ranging from child product safety to financial security, to the safety of hazardous waste facilities would cease.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Sandy recovery efforts, the West, Texas investigation and other fire and emergency response grants would be halted.\xc2\xa0 And on that, I just want to point out that when it comes to disaster -- emergency disaster relief, there is the fund that is operational.\xc2\xa0 So should there be a disaster, there would be funding available for initial and immediate emergency relief.\xc2\xa0 But what would be affected by a shutdown are the ongoing Sandy recovery efforts and the investigation into the explosion in West, Texas, and the like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo those are the impacts and effects that matter.\xc2\xa0 We, like every other agency, would be affected, but it\'s folks out in the country who will be affected that concerns us most.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you for that information.\xc2\xa0 But, again, how will the President plan to go to Asia if there\'s a schedule -- skeleton crew and a lean operation here?\xc2\xa0 And then, also, how is ASEAN affected --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President said today, not long ago, that he is not resigned to the idea that the government will shut down.\xc2\xa0 He remains hopeful that the House will come to the reasonable decision that it is appropriate to simply extend funding of the government further for several weeks in order to allow for the kind of negotiations that they claim they want about our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 So he remains hopeful, at least not resigned, to the fact of a shutdown.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when it comes to the mechanics of the trip and the people and equipment that gets positioned abroad for a trip like this, I just would have to refer you to OMB or to the agencies involved -- Department of Defense, Secret Service.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one of the other proposals floating around up on Capitol Hill would be a really, really short-term CR, something along the lines of a week, to keep the government running.\xc2\xa0 You, from this podium in the past, have described that as sort of "tollbooth government," or even these continuing resolutions as "tollbooth government."\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a one-week CR be sort of the ultimate tollbooth government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to respond to ideas floating around the Hill.\xc2\xa0 There are tons of them, and we could respond all day to them.\xc2\xa0 Right now, the option available, as I understand it, to the House, to the Speaker, will be the opportunity to follow the Senate\'s lead in funding the government for a number of weeks in a clean continuing resolution.\xc2\xa0 And we would support that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis process, again, has been one where a small faction, a very extreme faction of Republicans in the House has essentially forced its leadership to go along with a proposition that it is better to shut down the government, with all of the negative effects that we\'ve talked about, and better perhaps to default on our obligations for the first time in history than to allow a law that was passed and signed and upheld by the Supreme Court to be implemented -- a law that would provide millions of Americans who do not have insurance access to affordable insurance.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd one might surmise that the extreme agita that you see among Republicans right now over the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare is a direct result of the fact that, beginning tomorrow, there is a concrete development that means that millions of Americans will, for the first time, be able to sign up for that health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And as I think I\'ve seen Republicans say, it will be a lot harder to get rid of Obamacare once these individuals who have had a hard time getting affordable health care are able to see the benefits of the Affordable Care Act provides to them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House might be open to a one-week CR --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to negotiate ideas that are floated to me from any row of this briefing room, except to say that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think extraneous political agenda items ought to be -- well, maybe from the front -- (laughter) -- I think I\'ll just make it a blanket opposition to that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut let me just say that Congress ought to do its job.\xc2\xa0 It only has a few absolute functions, and one of them is to ensure that the government and its essential operations are funded.\xc2\xa0 Another is to ensure that the United States pays its bills, as it has throughout the entire history of the nation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, let me just follow up real quick.\xc2\xa0 In the last couple of weeks, Democrats, including the President, have<br/>\n\t-- and he has not used all of these words, but I\'ll throw out some of them that have been used -- have referred to Republicans as "arsonists," "anarchists," "extortionists, "blackmailers" --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just said extortion and -- yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ -- "hostage-takers."\xc2\xa0 Dan Pfeiffer talked about bombs being strapped to chests.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It almost sounds as if this White House is trying to taunt Republicans into shutting the government down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the case.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as I think I just saw my colleague, Dan Pfeiffer, on CNN\'s air not long ago say that I think it was Mitch McConnell who, in the iteration of these negotiations -- similar ones two years ago -- who referred to the economy being a hostage that they could take in negotiations with the President.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is language that either side has exclusive rights to or has only used in the past.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut here are the facts.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to funding the government or when it comes to paying our debts, the Democrats and the President, on one hand, are asking for nothing -- no concessions, no ideological riders, no special pet projects, no political gotcha items -- in exchange for the simple extension of government funding, in exchange for Congress ensuring that we do not default.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRepublicans, on the other hand, are attaching -- in the concrete bills that they\'ve passed and in their imaginations anyway when they talk about what they\'d like to attach -- all sort of political agenda items, some of them wildly inconsistent with where the American people want the country to move.\xc2\xa0 And that includes issues that are wholly unrelated to the budget and wholly unrelated to the debt and the deficits that we must manage, and the responsibility of Congress to ensure that we don\'t default.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, Jay, one following on Jim.\xc2\xa0 This is no longer such a hypothetical -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has hot-lined a one-week CR in the Senate within the last few minutes, maybe hour.\xc2\xa0 So it looks like there\xe2\x80\x99s some movement on that on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And you said that Congress has the responsibility to keep the government funded.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, would the President sign a one-week CR?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you just mentioned this happened in the last couple minutes, so I\'m not going to give you a statement of administration policy except to say that it has long been our position that Congress ought to make sure that the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shut down, and they ought not to attach to their responsibility to ensure that the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shut down any ideological poison pills or any agenda items that they can\'t achieve through the normal process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\'ll have to see what Congress does.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of movement in Congress that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t result in actual action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Affordable Care Act, will the President be doing anything tomorrow to promote the rollout, and can you talk a little bit about what the White House is going to be doing, broadly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any information at this time for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly the case -- and I appreciate you bringing it up -- that the Department of Health and Human Services and others are engaged in preparing for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s opening day of enrollment and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of activity around that.\xc2\xa0 And it will be the first day of the six-month open enrollment period for individuals to basically shop for health insurance in a way that they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been able to before, and for so many of them to have options available to them at affordable prices that they\xe2\x80\x99ve never had before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we expect that when those marketplaces open and the exchanges open and you can, as a consumer, review your options either online or through the telephone call centers, there will be a lot of window-shopping, a lot of people will assess what\xe2\x80\x99s available to them, and then, as time passes and we move closer to January 4th, more and more of the millions of Americans who have this option available to them will take advantage of it.\xc2\xa0 And that will be a very good thing, indeed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon Karl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, are these briefings essential?\xc2\xa0 Will you continue to brief in the middle of a shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the American people be apprised of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here at the White House, and we will endeavor to provide that information as best we can with a skeletal staff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that this will be a political disaster for Republicans if there\xe2\x80\x99s a shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t make any kind of predictions.\xc2\xa0 And that suggests that we\'re looking for an outcome -- I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, and honestly, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know that we don\'t care about the politics of this.\xc2\xa0 The President cares about making sure that the American people aren\'t hurt by it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBecause we talked about this with regards to the comprehensive immigration reform legislation that passed with a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate, and there were some question about whether secretly we didn\xe2\x80\x99t hope that the Republicans in the House would block it because it would be bad<br/>\n\t-- continued bad news for the Republicans when it came to their ever-worsening relations with Hispanic Americans across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the answer is, no.\xc2\xa0 We would love them to take advantage of the political opportunities available to them by passing comprehensive immigration reform and maybe improving their standing among Hispanic Americans by doing it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we would love for Republicans to do the right thing and maybe improve their standing among the American people, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99s standing among the American people, by simply not shutting down the government and not defaulting on our obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to go through very quickly some of what the Republicans are demanding and what\xe2\x80\x99s negotiable and what\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 The debt ceiling -- nothing there negotiable, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The idea of repealing the health care law -- obviously not negotiable.\xc2\xa0 Delaying the health care law for a year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not negotiable?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, the answer is, no.\xc2\xa0 And nothing is negotiable when it comes to the debt ceiling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as the President said recently when it comes to extending the government, he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to talk about ways to improve the health care law if Republicans are interested in that.\xc2\xa0 After all, a lot of the Affordable Care Act is designed -- its essential elements were designed by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that there are Republicans out there who probably earnestly have some good ideas, although they\'re most likely afraid to talk about them in party circles.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President is eager to do that.\xc2\xa0 What he is not willing to do is have those negotiations under the threat of shutting down the government, and certainly not under the threat of defaulting on our obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the idea of delaying this tax or of cutting this tax on medical devices also non-negotiable?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I answered that with Nedra that that\'s not -- look, Congress has throughout its time in session the opportunity to consider and pass legislation, to try to get majorities big enough in both houses to achieve a compromise between the House and the Senate and send it to the President.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way it is supposed to work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as you know, the House Republicans in particular have done little else over the past couple of years than attempt to legislate ways that either defund or repeal or in other ways negatively effect the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So they can certainly endeavor to keep doing that.\xc2\xa0 But to have that attached to the simple responsibility to fund the government, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not acceptable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen really no negotiations going on because basically everything the Republicans have put out there is non-negotiable?\xc2\xa0 Right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- here\xe2\x80\x99s it is.\xc2\xa0 It is not a concession to keep the government open.\xc2\xa0 It is not a concession to pay America\xe2\x80\x99s bills.\xc2\xa0 That is a responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And as I emailed with a reporter out here, it is enshrined in the Constitution that Congress has the power to pay debts; Congress has the power to authorize funding.\xc2\xa0 If it were otherwise, the President would go about it and there would be no drama and no delay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, last question.\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing over these next several hours to try to keep the government running?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it is not, unfortunately, within the President\xe2\x80\x99s power to pass legislation on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 The President said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is he doing?\xc2\xa0 Is he using the bully -- what\xe2\x80\x99s he doing over the next several hours?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President said just moments ago that he will certainly be, he expects, having conversations with leaders in Congress.\xc2\xa0 But it is pretty elemental here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an option to keep the government open, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an option to shut it down for ideological reasons.\xc2\xa0 And he would not presume to have the power of persuasion within the House Republican caucus that perhaps John Boehner does, or perhaps other leaders in the conference, rather, might have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me move around.\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said he was open to negotiating on the budget overall.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said it all year long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I assume that if there were a one-year proposition of funding the government, not through a two or three month-- is that what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying?\xc2\xa0 Is he saying that -- is that what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, though, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s about funding the government for 2014?\xc2\xa0 And if he\xe2\x80\x99s open to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, as is reflected in his budget.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, under those circumstances, under that umbrella then, are parts of the law, of the health care law part of those negotiations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President said the other day that he is open to discussions with Republicans who are sincere about it -- ways to improve the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he might be open to some of these changes under that set of negotiations, but just not over CRs or debt ceilings?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s open to delaying the individual -- because he is not.\xc2\xa0 Because that is a deliberate, explicitly stated effort to basically eliminate Obamacare.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the medical device tax would qualify as something he\xe2\x80\x99d be open to under regular circumstances?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific things, but he is certainly willing to negotiate with and discuss with Congress -- not under the threat of a shutdown or default -- ways to improve the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And that has been the case and will be the case moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And he is willing and eager to negotiate with lawmakers in Congress -- Republicans who are interested in finding common ground on our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 And he has demonstrated that all year long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, remember, if I may, Republicans insisted as part of the last time that we had a budget negotiation with deadlines, at the end of last year, that they would move forward with a bill that raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans and locked into place a permanent tax cut for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 In exchange for that, they insisted that the Senate pass a budget.\xc2\xa0 Because the House had and the Senate --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Negotiate on the debt ceiling --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, they raised the debt ceiling without drama and delay, no threat of default.\xc2\xa0 But they insisted as part of this that the Senate pass a budget.\xc2\xa0 They were hopping mad about the fact that the Senate had not passed a budget because the House had passed a budget.\xc2\xa0 And so the Senate passed a budget.\xc2\xa0 As John Boehner said, he wanted regular order in the Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be.\xc2\xa0 The House ought to pass a budget.\xc2\xa0 The Senate ought to pass a budget.\xc2\xa0 The two sides ought to come together in conference and try to work out their differences, produce a compromise budget that could then move forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the Senate upheld its obligations.\xc2\xa0 Senator Murray did an excellent job moving a bill forward, passing a budget through the Senate, with Leader Reid, and it has languished ever since, with the House refusing -- House leaders refusing to do what they said they would do, which is appoint conferees.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo here we are -- the President all year long has put forward a budget proposal that is filled with compromises, filled with a demonstrable effort to find common ground, and Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t even negotiate over that.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they are obsessed with refighting an old battle from a couple of Congresses ago, which was the debate about the Affordable Care Act and its passage, and the fact that it was signed into law, and the fact that it was upheld by the Supreme Court, and the fact that it was a subject of heightened debate during the presidential election and the candidate who supported the Affordable Care Act was reelected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the NSA story?\xc2\xa0 It seems like every week there\xe2\x80\x99s a new discovery of NSA doing something that you guys swear NSA wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing -- and in this case, following innocent Americans and their social networks, and creating this, apparently, labyrinth graph of how they create networks.\xc2\xa0 Can you look at this with a straight face and say this isn\xe2\x80\x99t sort of going a step beyond what you guys have said NSA was doing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is the NSA\xe2\x80\x99s activities are directed against foreign intelligence targets in order to protect that nation and its interests from threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\xc2\xa0 What I cannot do is comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.\xc2\xa0 But as a matter of policy, we have made clear that we do what other nations do, which is gather foreign intelligence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait.\xc2\xa0 This is about -- not against -- this is about Americans.\xc2\xa0 This is about Americans that are not foreign, that it went beyond this.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you denying that it was the case?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss specific tools or processes.\xc2\xa0 But, as you know, NSA\xe2\x80\x99s activities are directed against foreign intelligence targets in order to protect the nation and its interests from threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNSA\xe2\x80\x99s foreign intelligence activities are conducted pursuant to procedures approved by the United States Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense and, where applicable, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to protect the privacy interests of Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have to say and that that\xe2\x80\x99s the statement you have to say.\xc2\xa0 But are you at all concerned that it went beyond this, that it appears that it was supposed --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to be about foreign -- it was supposed to be about addressing people that have potential connections overseas, but this went a step beyond.\xc2\xa0 It went beyond what you just said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address a specific allegation.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is -- note what the President said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, which is that we have begun to review the way that we gather intelligence so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.\xc2\xa0 And that process is underway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to continue to get this drip, drip, drip out of NSA, which is you tell us a certain amount, something gets leaked by Snowden, and then you guys acknowledge, okay, we were doing that -- I mean, is that how this cat-and-mouse game is going to work for a while?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about specific things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol, and then Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness to negotiate on a long-term budget deal.\xc2\xa0 When he says that, what\xe2\x80\x99s the window for that?\xc2\xa0 And is that an offer to sit down and have negotiations with Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Does that happen after the CR, before the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 What are the qualifications around negotiating something long term?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s an offer that\xe2\x80\x99s been on the table for the whole year, virtually, or since the end of the year last year, when the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just an open-ended offer?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has demonstrated that he is open to and eager to negotiate with Republicans who want to find common ground and are willing to compromise when it comes to how we best fund our government in a way that invests in areas that help our economy grow and help our middle class be more secure, but also reduces our deficits and debt in a responsible way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is reflected in his budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 It was the central topic of the many conversations the President had and the Vice President and the Chief of Staff and many others had with Republicans over the course of the year -- especially earlier in the year when we were hopeful that there was a willingness by Republicans to find common ground, when we were hopeful that there might be sincerity behind the assertion by Republicans that all they really wanted was the Senate to pass a budget and then there could be a conference and we could reach a compromise.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, yes, that offer remains on the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if he\xe2\x80\x99s so eager to do it, are we going to see a big, renewed push by him in the next weeks and months?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A negotiation is not a one-way proposition.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward ideas.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker, each time he addresses any budget issue, keeps moving further and further way. So when he first came forward with an idea that he would fund -- a proposition where he would have a continuing resolution that allowed for a clean continuance of funding for the government, he backed away from under pressure from the small faction or the less-than-majority faction within his conference, and instead launched off on this effort to try to appease the extreme wing of his party that wants -- is focused not on reducing the deficit, not on dealing with our long-term debt, but on going after this piece of legislation that the President passed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any renewed push?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xc2\xa0 -- he just said that today.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because usually when he\xe2\x80\x99s eager to do something we see a big move.\xc2\xa0 So should we expect something like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not under threat of shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Not under threat of default.\xc2\xa0 But if the Republicans are serious about negotiating the priorities that we have as a nation, to fund through congressional appropriations, yes.\xc2\xa0 And he has been willing to do it all year long, and has sought partners in trying to do that, and had many good meetings with Republicans who expressed interest in doing that.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t see anything concrete from Republicans that represents the same spirit of and substantive reflection of compromise that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget represents.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s idea has just been floated, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not very intricate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple -- it\xe2\x80\x99s one-week, clean CR.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get it, Major, but here I am -- you guys have BlackBerries.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to respond to everything that you say is showing up on your BlackBerries.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific response to an idea that\'s floated -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rule in or out anything that I don\'t have specific information on that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten myself. So what I can tell you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- don\'t get email up there --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I should have a little action up here.\xc2\xa0 But the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be a one-week mechanism to keep the government open.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, we can do this -- other people -- I don\'t have a reaction to a floated proposal from a now-empty seat on the front row -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 CNN.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut our position is the same.\xc2\xa0 We will obviously see what happens in Congress, and the President made clear just now in the Oval Office what his view is, which is that the responsible thing to do is for the House to not engage in this partisan brinksmanship, but to rather responsibly pass a bill that extends funding at current levels of our government operations so that it does not shut down and that it does not have the negative effects that I went through before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said a moment ago to Chuck that if it\'s a good idea, the President is open to it on the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Is eliminating the medical device tax a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that is a good idea.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously part of the affordable care -- but I\'m not here -- Major, as interesting as it might be, we\'ve already said we would not support that as part of any deal to shut down -- a threat of shutting down.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to get into future hypothetical negotiations the Republicans have thus far all year long not shown themselves interested in holding.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'ll see what happens if the Republicans change their mind and want to have serious, substantive negotiations about how we find common ground to fund our budget priorities, reduce our deficit in a responsible way, and protect the middle class.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen so far from Republicans concretely in their budget proposals are ideas that do the opposite -- that protect special interests with their tax breaks, that stick it to the middle class, and that, of course, defund or repeal the Affordable Care Act -- which, by the way, is a huge budget-buster, increases the deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Benjamin Netanyahu said, with the President, that he would be in favor of stronger sanctions if negotiations with Iran either drag on or prove less than fruitful.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position, the President\'s position from the day he took office and made clear that he was willing to have bilateral conversations with Iran if Iran were serious about resolving this issue, is that, absent progress on that issue, absent a willingness by Iran to deal with this nuclear weapons problem, that the international community ought to isolate Iran through sanctions, and make clear through sanctions and other means that the violation of its international obligations was a serious matter.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we have done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so another way of asking that which I can answer is, the sanctions regime has brought us to this point.\xc2\xa0 The international consensus that the sanctions regime -- that was made possible by the -- sorry -- the international consensus was made possible by the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 We were able to change the focus of the international community from a debate about whether the United States was part of the problem to a focus on the fact that Iran was the problem.\xc2\xa0 And through the last five years, we\'ve seen the imposition and steady escalation of sanctions in a way that has had a dramatic impact on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ve seen reflections of that in the statements of members of the new government.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are encouraged by what we have heard from the new Iranian leadership.\xc2\xa0 But, as we\'ve said all along, actions are what we are focused on.\xc2\xa0 And there was P5-plus-1 meeting in which Secretary Kerry and his Iranian counterpart participated, they had a separate pull-aside.\xc2\xa0 And there is another P5-plus-1 meeting coming up in about 16 days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is the vehicle through which we will be able to measure concrete progress and test the theory here that Iran is serious, as Iran has said it is, about resolving this issue in a way that meets its international commitments.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if it\'s not, stronger sanctions --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that we\'re certainly not going to give sanctions relief absent action by --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you strengthen them, intensify them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s hard for me to -- we have steadily, over the past five years, strengthened and intensified, with our partners around the world, the sanctions regime against Iran.\xc2\xa0 I think right now we\'re exploring the possibility that Iran is serious about resolving this challenge, and we want to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you\'re saying that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, obviously, whether or not Iran will follow through on their promises.\xc2\xa0 But the President did call the new President on Friday, of Iran, and sort of opened up diplomatic negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So why not do the same with the House Republicans?\xc2\xa0 You\'re at loggerheads.\xc2\xa0 Call them.\xc2\xa0 Bring them over here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I love the reassertion of GOP talking points.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you at least talk to them?\xc2\xa0 Even if they\'re wrong --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I remind you that it was the Speaker of the House in several venues who said at the beginning of this year that he would never negotiate with the President again; that he felt doing so burned him and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So call him out.\xc2\xa0 Call him out and bring him over here and force him --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, maybe you didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch up to what the President just said, but he said he would be talking to leaders of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why is there not a meeting today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have nothing new to report on the President\'s schedule.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the House of Representatives could have in the past, a few days ago, and could today, very easily avoid shutting down the government by passing a clean continuing resolution that extends funding of the government for several weeks into the future, allowing for further negotiation about our budget priorities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou know, even FOX has reported this, that the Speaker had one approach he wanted to take and then the tea party yanked him in the other direction.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of Republicans, including in the House, say that they believe if the Speaker would just put on the floor the Senate bill, a clean CR, that it would get a majority in the House, including the votes from the Republican Party necessary.\xc2\xa0 So what we have here, if these Republican lawmakers -- Ra\xc3\xbal Labrador, Charlie Dent, Tom Cole and others -- are accurate, what we have is a proposition here where majorities of both houses are absolutely willing to pass clean continuing resolutions -- and for nongovernmental folks out there, that just means legislation that keeps the government open, without an ideological riders attached or imperatives attached -- majorities in both houses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the issue then is will the Speaker of the House do that, or will he shut down the government?\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a majority in both houses to do it.\xc2\xa0 We saw it in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We know it exists in the House.\xc2\xa0 So this should not be about the internal politics of the House Republican conference because it\xe2\x80\x99s too serious.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but that\'s their problem.\xc2\xa0 For you, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is he\xe2\x80\x99s in favor of a long-term budget deal.\xc2\xa0 How do you get a long-term budget deal without actually sitting down with anyone to hammer that out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has met with and spoken with countless Republicans this year, including the Speaker of the House, and has made clear in concrete ways through his budget proposals and through his offer to Speaker Boehner at the end of last year, his seriousness about compromise, his willingness to make tough choices when it comes to resolving our differences and funding our priorities, protecting the middle class and dealing with our deficits -- continuing to bring down our deficits, which, by the way, have been falling at the most precipitous rate since the end of World War II -- again, not a talking point you often hear from the Republican Party, just as you don\'t often hear in the midst of all this debate claims by the Republicans that this is about deficits or debt anymore.\xc2\xa0 It can\'t be because doing most of what they insist we do with their demands would actually increase the deficit and debt, rather than decrease it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I guess that\'s not their main priority anymore.\xc2\xa0 Their objective now is focused entirely on trying to prevent the implementation of a law that passed Congress, was signed into law by the President, was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States and validated across the nation in a presidential election.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seventeen years ago, we had another government shutdown, and we had people like Gene Sperling and Sylvia Burwell and Jack Lew were around at that time.\xc2\xa0 Have they offered --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So was I.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in a different capacity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, indeed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were in government.\xc2\xa0 Have they offered any sort of lessons learned from that and applied them to today\xe2\x80\x99s situation at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this already several times in terms of the prospect of shutdown or default.\xc2\xa0 And most of the people you named, with the exception of Sylvia, were here -- including Bruce Reed and others -- for parts of that.\xc2\xa0 So I think a lot of people here remember -- the Vice President and others -- what happened in \xe2\x80\x9995 and \xe2\x80\x9996.\xc2\xa0 But obviously this is a new and different time.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on 2013.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the middle class today -- the seniors and women and children who would be affected if there\xe2\x80\x99s a shutdown; the veterans whose call centers would close effective 12:01 a.m. October 1st if there\xe2\x80\x99s a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit different today than it was then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes.\xc2\xa0 Not to say that past experience for all of us isn\xe2\x80\x99t a useful thing to have when contemplating the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Democrats who think that the President has made a concession in just extending current spending which is at sequestration rates.\xc2\xa0 And the fear is that this will -- whatever comes out of this, if there is a long-term agreement, would lock in sequestration for another year.\xc2\xa0 Can you rule for the President that he would ever agree to another year\xe2\x80\x99s extension of sequestration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jackie, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of where we are now, which is focusing on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to ensure that the government doesn\'t shut down -- the ease with which the House could do it by simply extending funding at current levels, as you mentioned, for a short period of time to allow for further negotiation and to not make this about a partisan wish list, attaching things to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s essential responsibility that the tea party Republicans can\'t get otherwise, and that the American people rejected in an election.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President has put forward a budget.\xc2\xa0 I know you and others have looked at it and you know what his priorities are, you know where he\xe2\x80\x99s been willing to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And he is willing to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 He did not put that budget forward and say, I get this or there\xe2\x80\x99s no negotiation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the approach he takes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s often at times the approach Republicans take.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe understands that this requires compromise and finding common ground.\xc2\xa0 But what he won\xe2\x80\x99t do and what he has never suggested he would do is reduce our deficit in a way that puts all the burden on the middle class, or all the burden on our seniors, or all the burden on children through underfunding their educational opportunities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to do this responsibly.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated over the course of the last five years almost that you can inherit the largest deficits in our history, the worst financial crisis in our history -- or close to it, certainly in our lifetimes -- manage those challenges; steady our economy; save the automobile industry; see the economy begin to grow and create jobs; see it create 7.5 million private sector jobs -- do all that, pass the Affordable Care Act, which was a goal of members of both parties for a century, including Republican Presidents, and see our deficits come down by half, at a rate we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen since the 1940s.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo his record is pretty good on this.\xc2\xa0 And through a willingness to compromise, we can move forward and do more in a way that allows our economy to grow and allows it to invest in the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a day when you have three big things on the agenda<br/>\n\t-- this shutdown watch, the health care -- eve of the health care open enrollment starting, and a visit by the Israeli Prime Minister, can you give a sense of what sort of the atmosphere is like in the -- does it feel like a busier-than-usual day?\xc2\xa0 Is it tense?\xc2\xa0 What\'s it like back there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s busy.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s always busy here.\xc2\xa0 It\'s busy for most of you in covering this White House and any White House.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re very much focused on making sure that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act continues -- and it will; making sure that the enrollment period that opens tomorrow opens and continues for six months -- and it will; and making, as much as we can, information about that available to the public, to those millions of Americans and their families who will now have the opportunity to shop for affordable health insurance for the first time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, on the foreign policy side, as the President noted -- I think we may have done this count, I can\'t remember, but I think it\'s accurate to say that President Obama has met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu more than he has any other foreign leader, and that reflects the closeness of the relationship between our two nations, the United States\' commitment to Israel\'s security, and the importance of the issues that the two leaders discussed today, including Syria and Iran, where we\'ve had major developments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo busy times, to be sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, looking ahead to tomorrow, what is your level of confidence that this rollout is going to be ready and that it\'s going to rise to the expectations that the President and others have set for it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you would have to evaluate the expectations.\xc2\xa0 It will be ready and it will happen.\xc2\xa0 And regardless of what the Republicans do in terms of pursuing their ideological agenda, implementation continues.\xc2\xa0 As those of you know how this works, the funding for the Affordable Care Act will not be significantly affected by any effort that the Republicans decide to take to shut down the government.\xc2\xa0 And millions of Americans are going to have available to them the opportunity to enroll in these marketplaces and to purchase affordable health care for the first time in years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, their option -- we talked about the options available to them in the past.\xc2\xa0 And for most of these Americans, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have networks, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have doctors, they had the emergency room.\xc2\xa0 And their kids, when they had an asthma problem, they had the emergency room.\xc2\xa0 And now they\'ll have something far better and more reliable available to them, which is health insurance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying the President has nothing on his schedule regarding this tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that at all.\xc2\xa0 I just said I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to do something?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s it going to say to the public if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do something?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, again, I\'m not going to get into a back- and-forth about what is or is not on his schedule because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about the government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Roger talked about 17 years ago.\xc2\xa0 A lot has changed, including some of the provisions that have been put in place to make -- to cushion the shutdown, to make it less traumatic.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you have a prediction or if you\'ve come to a consensus among yourselves about how long it might take for people to really feel it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when the sequester happened, there were a lot of predictions from the White House that it would be awful and people would rise up and demand that it ended, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if a shutdown this time is going to be less catastrophic than 17 years ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that essential functions, some of them continue.\xc2\xa0 Different parts of the federal operations are affected in different ways.\xc2\xa0 But the impacts are considerable and I listed some of them.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the sort of underpinning of your question sort of supposes that we\'re approaching this in terms of how much political pressure will it take for Republicans to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hoping maybe zero and maybe they\'ll just do the right thing, and take up the President\'s year-long, essentially, offer to have substantive negotiations about how we fund the government in a way that helps it grow and create jobs and invest, and reduce our deficit in the medium and long term, rather than playing this game that has as its victims primarily regular Americans out there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think it\'s important to note, obviously, the immediate deadline we face here is the lapse in funding that would occur come midnight.\xc2\xa0 But there have been all sorts of suggestions from Republicans on Capitol Hill that they look forward to engaging in this again in just a few short weeks when the consequences would be even more serious -- far, far more serious, and unknowable in many ways, but bad in every case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I have a question about that, which is -- you were asked this two years ago about if the President had any constitutional recourse if the debt ceiling is breached and at that time you said no.\xc2\xa0 But there have been suggestions that he\'s going to be violating the Constitution if he lets the debt ceiling breach go into effect; he\'ll be violating it if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I mean, have you taken a new look at this -- it\'s only 17 days away -- at the legalities of this and what he could do to prevent --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what this is when it comes --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Breaching the debt ceiling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congress has to vote to raise the debt ceiling. The President can\'t raise it by himself.\xc2\xa0 People have talked about the 14th Amendment, and this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the power to ignore the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And even if the President could ignore the debt ceiling, the fact that there is significant controversy around the President\'s authority to act unilaterally means that it would not be a credible alternative to Congress raising the debt ceiling, and would not be taken seriously by the global economy and markets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs the President said today, the reason why this is so serious is because the world looks to the United States as the world economic leader, and relies on the stability and good faith and credit of the United States enormously.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it is so important to maintain that, and never even to flirt with the possibility that it would not be maintained in order to -- for any reason -- and in this case, in order to achieve this narrow political piece of business that tea party Republicans couldn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve through other means.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So his hands are completely tied on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it is up to the Congress to pay the debts of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Congress has the power to do that, according to the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 It is up to the Congress to appropriate funds and ensure that the government remains open and functioning.\xc2\xa0 And the President hopes that Congress takes those responsibilities seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow on the debt ceiling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 17 years ago, for a while the interns and volunteers were actually running the shop, and there was a danger to U.S. security.\xc2\xa0 If interns and volunteers were to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that has been the case and is not the case now that volunteers or interns would be working.\xc2\xa0 They will not.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAll the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry, L.A. Times, and then Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask -- the President, when he campaigned last year, talked a lot about how his reelection would break the fever in Washington.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering what you think his analysis is now -- why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t that happened?\xc2\xa0 Did he misjudge Republicans?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty stubborn fever, clearly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he thinks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I -- that\xe2\x80\x99s my observation, not his.\xc2\xa0 I think we all can assess without anyone\xe2\x80\x99s assistance that Republican intransigence remains quite real.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, here we have an opportunity to ensure that the government shuts down -- does not shut down.\xc2\xa0 Democrats, the President aren\xe2\x80\x99t asking for anything.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not attaching anything to this proposal; not attaching anything to the proposal that Congress fulfill its responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And yet, the prospect of shutdown and the prospect of default are on the table because Republicans want to attach to those fundamental responsibilities highly partisan political agenda items that they have not been able to achieve through the normal legislative process or through the electoral process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President concede that that was not a realistic campaign promise?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he hopes and believes that common sense will prevail and that we can get about the business of reaching reasonable compromise when it comes to our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no agreement to reach when it comes to the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 That should never be flirted with, reaching it, and it should never be used as a negotiating ploy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s very firm position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlexis, last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two quick mop-up questions.\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify -- by the time that you came out here today -- I just want to make sure I understand -- the President and the Vice President have not had any discussions about the shutdown with leaders as of today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no conversations involving the President or the Vice President to report to you today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every conversation, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to parse my words.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying the President spoke to this on camera just moments ago.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more beyond that to report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he also has on his schedule today a meeting with the Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on whether he wants to talk to them about the plans for a responsible shutdown, which is an enormous operation government-wise?\xc2\xa0 Is that the purpose of the meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that I expect that that would be a topic, the potential for a lapse in funding.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out other topics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, just to add -- everyone in the federal government who would be expected to either be furloughed or be considered excepted, they know that as of now, correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to OMB in terms of the notification process.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But here in the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for every person in the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about in your office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, in my office, people know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everybody knows?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:38 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
