Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Apologize for being a little more tardy than usual today.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tKathleen, do you want start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up a little on the news out of Andrews.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more detail on exactly what happened there this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional information about what happened there.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President is always quite concerned about the safety of our men and women in uniform, and it certainly is important that they undertake drills to prepare for a wide range of scenarios.\xc2\xa0 But for exactly what transpired today at JBA, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this sort of false alarm will become the kind of thing that\'s more common as people get a little more anxious or worried about these kinds of attacks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President certainly believes in vigilance, and he believes that we should be vigilant about protecting our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\'s always a risk of that.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important for there to be procedures in place so that authorities can communicate clearly with the community and with the public about what\'s transpiring.\xc2\xa0 But what\'s inherent in these kinds of situations is that they\'re always chaotic.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, it\'s hard for me to speak to this particular incident just because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about what exactly transpired.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then I just want to follow up on something he said yesterday at the press conference when he was asked about Brexit, and he was talking -- the President was talking about that he has genuine concerns about global concerns "if, in fact, Brexit goes through" and that freezes the possibility of investment in the UK.\xc2\xa0 Does he thinks there\'s the possibility that Brexit won\'t happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think others have asked about this because somebody else on our team flagged this for me.\xc2\xa0 I think this may be an issue of sentence construction.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was talking about the combined effects of Brexit and the negative impact it has on the possibility of investment from the UK into Europe, and then the potential impact that that could have on the global economy.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the point that the President was trying to make.\xc2\xa0 And this is why it is important for officials in the UK and officials in the EU to set up a transparent and orderly process for Brexit to prevent the unnecessary complications of companies that are trying to maintain their business relationships through Europe and the UK, even as the governments of these locations are negotiating a withdrawal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is, the President reiterated in the context of the news conference why he believes it\'s so important for officials in the UK and the EU to establish an orderly, transparent process for Brexit.\xc2\xa0 And there obviously will continue to be an enduring economic relationship between the UK and the EU.\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that relationship be any more disrupted than it already will by the process of the Brexit, because doing so would have an even more substantial impact on the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is hoping that UK and EU officials will takes steps to protect again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to Boris Johnson\'s announcement this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I had difficulty keeping up with the candidates for President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 My ability to keep track of the candidates for prime minister in the UK is even more limited.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll let him speak for himself.\xc2\xa0 He seems to have no trouble doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I just want to follow up on Kathleen\'s question.\xc2\xa0 The President did use the word "if" twice in his response to the Brexit question yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Does that -- just to be very clear, does he think there\'s a possibility that Brexit will not go through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President\'s expectation is that UK officials have the best sense of what\'s happening, and UK officials have been pretty definitive about the finality of this decision.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve heard people like the current prime minister.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve heard the ambassador from the UK to the United States indicates that this was a decision that was made by the British people.\xc2\xa0 And look, there\'s a lot invested in this election.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not as if people didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that this election was occurring.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of attention and there was a healthy debate around it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo ultimately it will be the responsibility of officials in the UK and officials in the EU to work together to determine what kind of economic relationship will exist between those two entities in the future.\xc2\xa0 But that will be part of the negotiation of the UK leaving the EU.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to end their economic relationship.\xc2\xa0 As the President pointed out yesterday, I think it\'s about half of all of UK exports go to EU countries.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s going to be a robust economic relationship there.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just going to be different because the UK won\'t have the same kind of access to the common market that they have previously enjoyed.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut establishing that transition period and determining what the post-Brexit economic relationship looks like between the UK and the EU is important.\xc2\xa0 And answering those questions as quickly as possible, but in a way that is orderly and transparent and predictable, will be critical to minimizing the negative impact on the global economy over the long term.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s the other sort of key part of the President\'s answer here, is that he acknowledged that there\'s been obviously this volatility in the short term.\xc2\xa0 But how this plays out over the long term will have an impact on the long-term prospects for the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it\'s possible to roll back that vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President believes that it\'s UK officials who should speak to this, and that\'s exactly what UK officials have said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a reaction to Attorney General Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton at a time when DOJ is overseeing the probe into Secretary Clinton\'s email usage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I\'ve obviously seen the reports about this, and the reports are driven by the answer that Attorney General Lynch herself gave to this question.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the bottom line is simply that both the President and the Attorney General understand how important it is for the Department of Justice to conduct investigations that are free of political interference.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been a bedrock principle of our criminal justice system in this country since our founding.\xc2\xa0 The rule of law is paramount.\xc2\xa0 And every American citizen should be held accountable to that rule of regardless of their political affiliation, regardless of who supports them politically, regardless of what their poll numbers say.\xc2\xa0 And that is a principle the President believes is one that\'s worth protecting.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that that\'s so important is it prevents erosion in the public confidence in our justice system.\xc2\xa0 And this is a principle that Attorney General Lynch has dedicated her three decades in law enforcement to.\xc2\xa0 She served as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York.\xc2\xa0 She has her own firsthand experience in conducting public corruption cases.\xc2\xa0 She did that -- she protected the public trust by prosecuting individuals in both parties where there was evidence to indicate that they may have violated the public trust.\xc2\xa0 This was what earned her strong bipartisan support when she was nominated for the job.\xc2\xa0 And she has continued that work in the Attorney General\'s office in a variety of ways, including a recent announcement about Medicaid fraud, and obviously her efforts to root out corruption in one of the most influential international athletic organizations in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo she certainly understands that investigations should be conducted free of political interference and consistent with the facts.\xc2\xa0 Investigators should be guided by the facts and by evidence.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s ultimately what should support their conclusions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that that\'s the expectation that she has for the way that this investigation should be conducted.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that that certainly is consistent with his expectation about how this should be handled.\xc2\xa0 And so I also think that\'s consistent with the American public\xe2\x80\x99s expectation about how this should be handled.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given that, Josh, is the White House concerned about even just the appearance of political influence because of that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to second-guess the way that this investigation should move forward or should be handled.\xc2\xa0 Again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about the investigation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there for the meeting, but the Attorney General was.\xc2\xa0 She was asked a direct question about it, and she answered it.\xc2\xa0 So again, I think that\'s consistent with everybody\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is about the appearance that that meeting created.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that she was asked about it directly, and she answered the question directly about what exactly transpired.\xc2\xa0 And so she\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any insight into that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I also don\'t have any insight into the investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that this is an investigation that should be conducted free of any sort of political interference.\xc2\xa0 And the Attorney General has indicated that that\'s exactly her expectation, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the White House feels that it\xe2\x80\x99s fine that she had this meeting with Clinton?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no problem with it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the President believes that this principle of protecting any investigation from any sort of political interference is critically important.\xc2\xa0 The rule of law is paramount.\xc2\xa0 And people should be judged by the rule of law without regard to their partisan affiliation or their political standing.\xc2\xa0 And that is a principle that\'s worth protecting.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a principle that both the President and the Attorney General are committed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you said that she answered questions about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s any question of impropriety, who would stop at just asking the person who was involved in that, or if a mistake was made?\xc2\xa0 So does the President have a question for her about this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about this particular matter.\xc2\xa0 But again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is that this is an investigation that will be guided by the facts, not by politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'ve been gratified to see other senior officials at the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General and the FBI Director, indicate that that\'s a priority for them, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just talked about how important it is for people to see things being handled properly so that there is no erosion in public confidence.\xc2\xa0 But Democrats today -- some -- are also saying that just the optics of this, that they should have known better.\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about that potential of erosion in confidence.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t this have the potential to do that, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think -- again, I think what should give people confidence is the 30-year career that Attorney General Lynch has in keeping the public\xe2\x80\x99s trust, and making sure that she continues to be an effective advocate for the rule of law and for the fair administration of justice.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s done that throughout her career.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s done that in the Office of the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 And again, when it comes to appearances, she was asked very directly about the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And she answered the question very directly.\xc2\xa0 So for what impact that may have on the investigation, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to comment on that because I don\'t want to be in a position of second-guessing an investigation that, quite frankly, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not talking about the investigation itself.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the question that you\'re raising, is what potential impact does this optic have on the investigation.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you raised --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You raise the appearance which could lead to an erosion of public confidence in that process.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t mean the process itself is tainted.\xc2\xa0 But you spoke to the erosion of public confidence.\xc2\xa0 So if you seem satisfied with what the Attorney General said about the meeting, why will you not say that you\'re okay that that meeting happened, that you don\'t have a problem with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is simply -- when I was talking about the erosion of the public trust, what I said is public trust would be eroded if it were -- if people were not making an effort to make clear that these investigations should not be influenced by politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, other senior officials at the Department of Justice and the President of the United States have all indicated that the rule of law is paramount, that people should be subject to the rule of law without regard to their political standing or their political party or their poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 That is a principle that we should all subscribe to.\xc2\xa0 And the President, and the Attorney General, and the Director of the FBI all do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, you\'re not saying then that the President and the White House is fine with this meeting having happened the way it did.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I did not attend the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But Attorney General Lynch did, and she\xe2\x80\x99s spoken directly to how the meeting came about and what was discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are talking optics here, though, not the content of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Just the optics themselves.\xc2\xa0 I hate that word, but that\'s what everybody is talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the appearance, you\'re okay with the fact that this meeting has raised that question?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that that appearance has --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Attorney General speak to her meetings.\xc2\xa0 But what is paramount in the mind of the President is a commitment to the rule of law and a commitment to ensuring that justice is administered without regard to political affiliation or political standing.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering after some of the information that\'s come out in the last 24 hours if you guys are any closer to making a determination on who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the terror attack in Turkey yesterday -- or two days ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, listen, this is something that the CIA Director has talked about.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new information to share or an additional updated intelligence assessment to offer from here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when Director Brennan was talking about this yesterday, he indicated that this attack \xe2\x80\x9cbears the hallmarks of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s depravity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s an indication of what the intelligence community has assessed thus far.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think that is -- obviously, that is not a definitive analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\tU.S. officials are certainly using all of the information and all the tools at our disposal to learn as much as we can about this particular situation -- useful information we will readily share with our NATO allies, the Turks, as they conduct this investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t mean to leave you with the impression that we\'re not interested in it.\xc2\xa0 We are quite keenly interested in understanding exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 But this is an investigation that\'s being led by the Turks.\xc2\xa0 And we stand with them as they conduct this investigation and take the steps that are necessary to safeguard their country and their citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that, and given that the Turks I think have leaned even harder into the possibility that ISIS is responsible for this, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if in the conversation between Presidents Obama and Erdogan, if there was any signal from the Turks that they were going to intensify their efforts against ISIS.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been a point of some tension between the two Presidents.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\'re expecting sort of additional actions by Turkey.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any additional actions to preview or additional details from the call to share.\xc2\xa0 What I will just reiterate is how important a role the Turks have played in our counter-ISIL coalition.\xc2\xa0 And that is everything from taking steps to more effectively close their border with Syria, to giving U.S. and coalition military pilots access to military installations inside of Turkey that makes our military operations against ISIL in Syria more efficient and more effective.\xc2\xa0 So Turkey has played an important role.\xc2\xa0 They\'re a valuable member of our counter-ISIL coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago that all of you were asking me rather pointed questions about why Turkey wasn\xe2\x80\x99t more involved in our efforts against ISIL, and since that time we have seen the Turks become more active, more cooperative, and more effective in supporting our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could turn to the campaign, obviously we heard the announcement yesterday that the President is going down to North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the significance of North Carolina as the first stop, and specifically, I guess, if it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the President, Hillary Clinton, and Democrats are now kind of playing offense instead of defense.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s going to a state that he won once but is traditionally a Republican state, versus Wisconsin, which is kind of a Democratic stronghold.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, for the electoral strategy of the campaign, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Clinton operation.\xc2\xa0 They can obviously speak to this in much more detail than I can.\xc2\xa0 I think there are some relevant facts that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to point out, which is that the President in 2008 did win the state of North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 He was the first Democrat in some time to do so.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President decided to hold the Democratic Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2012 when he was running for reelection.\xc2\xa0 And it was an indication of the kind of political support that the President retains in that state.\xc2\xa0 So he obviously is proud of all that support.\xc2\xa0 But how this factors into Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign strategy, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to her operation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to parse one more bit of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday when he was talking about politicians, it was during this sort of sermon on populism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The self-described rant.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And he said some of the policies or positions that have been forwarded, presumably by Donald Trump, or Republicans, weren\xe2\x80\x99t nativism or xenophobia.\xc2\xa0 He said, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t populism but nativism, xenophobia or worse.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what that worse is?\xc2\xa0 I think pretty obviously it is racism.\xc2\xa0 And so if the President believes that these policies are racist, why he won\xe2\x80\x99t just say that, or if he will say that he believes Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s policies are racist.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s words speak pretty clearly for themselves.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll elaborate on them at great length.\xc2\xa0 The President also noted that this kind of rhetoric was rather cynical.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason he used that word is that the President believes that the policies that are being pursued by this administration are the ones that are most effective in advancing the interests of middle-class families across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the President spoke at this at some length, as well, in terms of our efforts to regulate Wall Street, to reform the health care system to ensure that more Americans would have access to quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are all policy decisions that the President made with middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class in mind.\xc2\xa0 He made these decisions and set these as priorities with the American people in mind, even though those kinds of steps have been regarded with some controversy by those at the top, by those with the most influence in Washington, D.C., by those with the most influence on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 You might even call them the elite.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s cynical to suggest that opposing those kinds of policies is somehow in the best interest of the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 And so for somebody who ran on a campaign platform that was rooted in hope, labeling something cynical I think should be viewed as a pretty harsh criticism.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Is the implication here that they\'re cynical for forwarding policies that would help elites?\xc2\xa0 Or is what you\'re really saying, the use of racist language, the President believes -- the President believes that Donald Trump is using racist language cynically for electoral gain, but is not perhaps actually racist?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The cynicism -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is the cynicism is rooted in the idea that there are people who have opposed for political reasons policies that this administration has put forward that have obviously benefitted the American people.\xc2\xa0 Twenty million Americans -- 20 million more Americans have gotten access to health insurance coverage after the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\xc2\xa0 Our economy has grown significantly and become more stable after Wall Street reform went into effect.\xc2\xa0 These are just two examples.\xc2\xa0 There are many others.\xc2\xa0 The President cited the auto industry yesterday as another example of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, these are all policies that were opposed for partisan reason by Republicans even though they\'ve had significant and well-documented benefits for the American people.\xc2\xa0 So for partisan reasons to oppose those policies and put forward alternatives -- Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t really put forward alternatives -- but to say that they\'re opposed to those policies because they\'re populist is cynical.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also just not true.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is the point that the President is making.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of other people who have raised concerns about what potentially -- what others have described as racially tinged remarks on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 Those are other people\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a word that the President chose.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President chose his words, as you noted, quite carefully.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the President\xe2\x80\x99s rant yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He named himself as a populist.\xc2\xa0 He named Bernie Sanders as a populist.\xc2\xa0 He did not name Secretary Clinton as a populist.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that Secretary Clinton is a populist?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why her name was left out of there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the point is -- I think the reason -- the point that the President was trying to make is, again, when it comes to a fair evaluation of the policies championed by this administration and the impact they\'ve had on the American people, I think the President is suggesting that people who are looking to apply the populism label could fairly apply it to the administration based on the fact these are policies that benefit the American people even though they were harshly criticized by the elite.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a pretty fair analysis of what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the point is, the reason that the President cited Senator Sanders is there are several instances or policy areas where Senator Sanders recommends going even farther.\xc2\xa0 That is different than the arguments that are made by some Republicans to go in the opposite direction.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s cynical for those who want to go in the opposite direction to describe themselves as populist, or to have impartial arbiters use a shorthand for their criticism of the President as populist criticism.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is the broader point.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to Secretary Clinton, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let her speak for herself to describe her own philosophy.\xc2\xa0 But again, my guess is, given the fact that she has been an outspoken advocate for building on the progress that our country has enjoyed under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, that you could probably fairly apply that label to her, too.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s something that her team should speak to.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was that rant -- self-described rant -- totally spontaneous?\xc2\xa0 Or has he been waiting for an opportunity to vent on the issue of populism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you what I noticed when I was there yesterday, is I noticed at one point during the news conference, the President did take out his pen and start making some notes to himself while the other leaders were talking.\xc2\xa0 And I assume that\'s where he was -- something had prompted him to think about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, yes, this was something that the President delivered extemporaneously.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think this is the first time the President had thought about it, but something in the context of the discussion at the news conference had returned him to this thinking.\xc2\xa0 And he clearly had jotted down some notes in his book and took advantage of the opportunity at the end of the news conference to share his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe there might be more rants in the pipeline?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Considering we\'ve got another six and a half months to go before the end of the presidency, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely we\'re all going to get to enjoy at least one more.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He indicated that he feels liberated at this point in his presidency to say things that he might not have been willing to say four years earlier.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there is a certain amount of freedom that politicians enjoy when they\'re not on the ballot.\xc2\xa0 But look, I also think that what\xe2\x80\x99s true is the President has a well-earned reputation for being pretty blunt and candid and speaking his mind.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s got his own style for doing so that\'s dismissed by some of his critics as professorial.\xc2\xa0 But I think there are a lot of other people who actually find that kind of argument to be pretty compelling and persuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that\'s something the President has done throughout his presidency.\xc2\xa0 And as somebody who chronicles the metrics of the presidency as carefully as you, my guess is there are probably a number of things -- a number of ticks in the spreadsheet under the rant column, if you decided to create one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'ll have to start his new log.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat can you tell us about plans for signing the Puerto Rico bill?\xc2\xa0 Will there be a signing ceremony when you get it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you saw from the statement that we put out last night, we\'re obviously pleased that the Senate has finally completed the bipartisan effort to give Puerto Rican officials the authority to deal with their significant financial problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is important because this is going to have a direct impact on the livelihood of the more than 3 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 There is a looming deadline tomorrow, so I would anticipate that the President will sign this piece of legislation into law shortly after we receive it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that will allow us time to organize a signing ceremony.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know as soon as the President has signed it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he doing all day today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has got a number of internal meetings today.\xc2\xa0 His schedule is a little lighter today because his schedule yesterday, frankly, was so jam-packed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think of the chants of \xe2\x80\x9cfour more years\xe2\x80\x9d in a foreign parliament?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I noticed that, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he notice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he did.\xc2\xa0 From the floor, I was unable to see his reaction.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t talk to him about it last night on the way back.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans the President has to run for Prime Minister of Canada.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or retire there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Or retire there.\xc2\xa0 I think he probably would -- as lovely as Ottawa was yesterday, I think the President would prefer a warmer climate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlex.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President pushed back when reporters asked him to weigh in on politics, and asked President Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau.\xc2\xa0 And he said that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- when he\xe2\x80\x99s abroad, it\xe2\x80\x99s not his job to weigh in on domestic politics.\xc2\xa0 But the President himself gave what you said was that self-described rant, and then during his parliament -- speech to parliament, he talked about the need not to rebuild walls.\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t the President himself bring American politics into the fore in Canada?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- the context in which a lot of these questions were asked yesterday were about a broader question about the sentiment of the electorate -- not in just the United States, but around the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are questions that have been raised about what does the electoral climate in the UK around the Brexit vote say about popular sentiment in the United States, and voter sentiment in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an entirely legitimate question.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, it has an impact on the 2016 election, but it also has a direct impact on American values and the kinds of things that the President has been fighting for, for the last seven and a half years that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I think it\'s impossible to separate the two, I guess is my point.\xc2\xa0 So while there might be some who would say, well, geez, the President was taking on the arguments of the 2016 election, but what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the President was taking on arguments that have been raised about the core American values that this President deeply believes in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that the President got a chance to answer Ms. Rampton\xe2\x80\x99s question yesterday about will the President next week, when he\'s campaigning, or along the cycle with Secretary Clinton -- will he offer a full-throated endorsement of TPP to her supporters.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to pitch the TPP directly to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s supporters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t have an update on the remarks at this point, and I certainly wouldn\'t rule out that the President will make a forceful case for the shared economic vision that\'s advocated not just by President Obama but by Democrats across the country, including Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President is going to make the case that Secretary Clinton and he agree on every single issue, but I do think he\'ll make a pretty persuasive case about how they have spent their careers fighting for the same values and the same priorities.\xc2\xa0 The President has always put those American families that are in the middle class and fighting to get in the middle class at the center of his domestic policymaking agenda, and Secretary Clinton does the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they agree on every issue.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to their values and priorities that are deeply held, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot in common.\xc2\xa0 And I think that will be the focal point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The TPP is emerging as a pretty big division in the Democratic Party between President Obama, and a big brunt of especially Senator Sanders.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, will the President -- if the Democratic platform is passed with language explicitly opposing TPP, would that change the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans at all and his attendance at the convention or his plans to speak there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re asking a hypothetical because the platform hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been finalized yet.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t anticipate at this point any changes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to participate in the Democratic convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the attack in Istanbul, you said the U.S. isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure whether this was ISIS or not.\xc2\xa0 Where is the ambiguity and the uncertainty about that at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I\'m relaying, Ron, is just that there\xe2\x80\x99s an intelligence assessment that\xe2\x80\x99s still being conducted.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to learn as much as we can about what exactly happened and the individuals who were responsible for this terrible terrorist incident.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have a lot of insight to share about what we know so far.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the interim, where there\xe2\x80\x99s this uncertainty, is it safe to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s not been an American -- U.S. response to what\xe2\x80\x99s happened directed at ISIS?\xc2\xa0 Nothing has changed on the battlefield, if you will, out there?\xc2\xa0 Or has something changed on the battlefield out there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess that does provide a pretty good opportunity to start talking about what is happening on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, I mean, just in the last 48 hours or so since this attack happened.\xc2\xa0 Again, if you\'re in this process of still trying to evaluate what happened, has there been something that has -- has there been a response or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we have seen tremendous progress that the United States and our coalition partners are making against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And there was the announcement earlier this week by the Iraqi central government that they had succeeded in driving ISIL fighters out of Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 This was a large priority of the coalition, in part because of its proximity to Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 And this is an operation that was more successful and went more swiftly than I think most experts had predicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But all that is pre-Istanbul.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, this has been a long -- is a long-planned effort, and the success was announced on Monday.\xc2\xa0 And then there were -- the other thing that has happened as Iraqi security forces were working to clear Fallujah, the United States and our coalition partners identified a large convoy of ISIL vehicles in Anbar who appeared to have recently left Fallujah, and allowed the United States and our coalition partners to carry out strikes against those vehicles that resulted in -- we\'re talking about two different convoys, but a total of more than 150 vehicles being destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that, I think, is a pretty substantial indication of the kind of pressure that ISIL is under, and the success that we\'re having in developing targets and acting against them in short order in a way that is having a material positive impact on the fight against ISIL on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the reports that the United States and the Russians are going to cooperate more deeply, militarily in Syria, specifically?\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what has been true for a long time, Ron -- and this was actually even true before the Russian military buildup in Syria last fall -- is that we talked a lot about how there was an opportunity for Russia to more effectively work with the United States and our 65 coalition partners to go after ISIL and to go after extremists in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been true from the very beginning.\xc2\xa0 The reason that that opportunity has not been capitalized on is that Russia has been far more focused on using their military might to prop up Assad than to actually go after extremists.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve said all along that there is an internal contradiction in the Russian strategy.\xc2\xa0 They say, they claim that they\'re quite concerned about extremists inside of Syria, but the steps that they\'re taking to prop up the Assad regime and make a political transition more difficult makes it harder for us to deal with the extremist threat inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there now -- is something different now?\xc2\xa0 Is there an agreement between the United States and Russia to cooperate militarily in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have not seen the Russians -- and again, I\'ve been saying this for more than a year, too -- we have not seen the Russians demonstrate a commitment to using their military might against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they\'ve been much more focused on propping up the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And that is a problem for a variety of reasons mostly because continuing to prop up the Assad regime makes it more difficult for the world to address the root cause of this extremist problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they\'ve got this internal contradiction in their strategy that they have been unable to explain or resolve for almost a year now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So nothing has changed.\xc2\xa0 I understand the background.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re familiar with these reports that there\'s some sort of agreement that\'s been reached.\xc2\xa0 You\'re familiar with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ve seen -- I saw one report in the Post this morning that alluded to all of this.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m saying is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details about sort of the behind-the-scenes diplomacy that is part of our open line of communication with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 But what hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed is our basic approach to this situation, which is we would welcome a Russian commitment to working more closely with the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I think the 65 members of our counter-ISIL coalition would welcome that kind of participation as well.\xc2\xa0 The problem has been that Russia is much more interested in propping up Assad than they are in going after ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And until that changes, we\'ve said it\'s hard to imagine coordinating out military efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what we have been doing thus far is we have been de-conflicting our efforts to provide for the safety of our military pilots primarily operating over Syria.\xc2\xa0 But what has prevented us from being able to more effectively coordinate militarily is that what the Russians have been militarily doing is propping up Assad and not going after ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a Navy investigation released on the report involving the Iranian military and the Navy sailors.\xc2\xa0 It seemed to be -- well, it was critical of the Americans, and some saying they weren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared, there were a litany of errors, there were a number of officers and others disciplined.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 The narrative coming out of that at the time seemed much more positive and supportive of the actions of the U.S. military in that context.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the immediate aftermath of this incident was the relief that we expressed about the safe return of our sailors.\xc2\xa0 But what the Navy has said since that day back in January is that they were going to conduct an investigation to determine what exactly had happened.\xc2\xa0 They briefed the results of that investigation earlier today, and I think there were a number of Navy personnel who were reprimanded for the way that they -- for their role in the incident.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for the details of all that, I\'d refer you to the Navy.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t look carefully at the investigation myself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess one of the concerns of it, it seemed -- the investigation -- as I read it quickly before we all gathered here -- was that it seemed to suggest that they were not prepared, that there was something systemic that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as it should be for them to deal with the situation like that when they found themselves in it.\xc2\xa0 It would suggest training, leadership, those sort of structural things, not necessarily what these individuals may or may not have done.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, for any recommendations that the Navy has, I\'m sure that they will be carefully considered by policymakers at the Department of Defense to make sure that something like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m just not aware of the substance of any recommendations they may have made.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can you just give a little bit more information about the Iraqi -- the airstrikes that knocked out a number of foreign fighters?\xc2\xa0 A big number.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just curious what you know about it.\xc2\xa0 Did the President order that particular strike?\xc2\xa0 And how soon was he advised?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, this is what I was alluding to with Ron.\xc2\xa0 My understanding about the way this worked is that ISIL -- I\'m sorry, Iraqi security forces have been working over the last several days to definitively clear Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 The Iraqis announced on Monday that they had retaken the city, and there was just an effort to complete the -- to essentially assure that all ISIL elements had been rooted out of that city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what occurred last night is that coalition military pilots detected the movement of two unusually large convoys moving away from the general direction of Fallujah through the desert of Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve talked before about how early on in this campaign we recognized that ISIL had changed tactics.\xc2\xa0 ISIL had originally been showing -- we saw footage of ISIL moving in large convoys across Iraq as they were taking large territory there back in the summer of 2014.\xc2\xa0 As soon as U.S. military pilots got involved, they were taking opportunistic strikes against those convoys.\xc2\xa0 ISIL, in response, changed their tactics and started moving in much smaller numbers to present less of a target to coalition military pilots.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat happened last night is that U.S. coalition pilots spotted two large convoys, and they took strikes against them.\xc2\xa0 And those strikes resulted, in the case of one convoy, of the destruction of more than 100 vehicles.\xc2\xa0 In the other convoy that was identified, more than 50 vehicles were destroyed.\xc2\xa0 And I think what this underscores is the success that the United States and our coalition partners are having in integrating our intelligence and our military capabilities.\xc2\xa0 Being able to quickly spot these targets, identify them, and take action against them is, frankly, harder than I just made it sound.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s something that now is clearly happening quite effectively in a way that is having a significant impact on ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that\'s true is that ISIL is certainly feeling under more pressure.\xc2\xa0 And that has been an important part of our strategy, which is to apply pressure to ISIL elements in a variety of different places simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s making it harder for ISIL to defend themselves.\xc2\xa0 And this is an example of why our efforts to expand the capacity of Iraqi security forces to make sure that they\'re well integrated with coalition military pilots, that we can apply -- we want to make sure we can apply maximum pressure against ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 And we saw the benefits to that approach last night in a way that has a tangible, negative impact on ISIL\'s ability to continue to fight this fight.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the success against ISIL, the Taliban seems to be enjoying a bit of a resurgence.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me about the attack on the cadets in Afghanistan there, what you know about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I got a briefing on that earlier today.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that extremists in Afghanistan did target some cadets from the Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 There were significant casualties associated with that -- dozens of casualties.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the Afghans for a more specific assessment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, this is I think an indication of something that we have long acknowledged, which is that security situation in Afghanistan is quite difficult, particularly in the fighting season.\xc2\xa0 But what is true, and what continues to be true, is that the Afghan forces are showing great determination and resilience, even in the face of some setbacks, like the one that you just described.\xc2\xa0 And what is important is the continued commitment of the United States and NATO and other international contributors to the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States and our coalition partners have good partners in the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important that we continue to support them both militarily and economically as they seek to both rebuild the institutions of that country but also strengthen the security forces in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A bit of housekeeping.\xc2\xa0 The DNI review of the 9/11 Commission\'s 28 pages, we were understanding that maybe by the end of June they would finally have something that the American people can take a look at.\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten an update on what\'s happening with that? \xc2\xa0And has the President, as yet -- because the last time you and I spoke, you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he had had a chance to read those 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 Has that changed at all?\xc2\xa0 And can you give me an update?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a timely reminder.\xc2\xa0 It is June 30th, after all.\xc2\xa0 And the Director of the DNI did indicate that he expected that they would have the results of this review concluded by the end of June.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten an updated assessment about the timeline, so you might check with his office to see where things stand.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has been briefed at this point on the final conclusions of the DNI.\xc2\xa0 But the President, while not having read the 28 pages, is aware of their contents and he has been briefed on the contents of those pages.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he\'s necessarily been briefed about what the DNI has concluded is appropriate for release.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last, I wanted to follow up on pretty much everybody\'s question about optics.\xc2\xa0 Would you at least acknowledge that if you have on the one hand a candidate, a former colleague whom you\'ve endorsed -- we\'re talking about Secretary Clinton; the President has endorsed her -- and his appointed Attorney General who is having social calls with her husband, the President, can you understand where people might feel like not only does it not look good, it makes them worried about the fact that this is going to be an open, transparent and impartial process as the investigations continue into her conduct regarding the server?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, let me try to answer your question this way.\xc2\xa0 I think the question you\'re asking is entirely legitimate, and I think the question that was asked of Attorney General Lynch was entirely legitimate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I think it was appropriate for her to give the direct answer that she did.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was also important for her to continue to demonstrate her commitment to a principle that she has stood up for in her three decades in public service, and that is the primacy of the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 The rule of law is most important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re all subject to it in the same way, without regard to our political affiliation or our partisan affiliation, without regard to who supports us politically or who opposes us politically.\xc2\xa0 We\'re all subject to the rule of law in the same way.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important that investigations are conducted consistent with that principle in mind.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of investigations should be conducted in a way that investigators simply follow the facts, they follow the evidence, and they use that to form conclusions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I guess the one part of your question that I might quibble with a little bit is, I don\'t think anybody is making the case that this kind of investigation is transparent right now, but what investigators do have a responsibility to do is, once they have conducted an investigation and reached a conclusion, that there is some explanation required in terms of how they reached that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s important that that conclusion not be rooted in political preference, but just be rooted in the facts and the evidence and what the law requires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s the way to ensure the fair administration of justice.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that the Attorney General has been committed to as a career prosecutor throughout her career.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that she\xe2\x80\x99s been committed to as the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 I know it\'s something that the FBI Director and all those who report to Director Comey and Attorney General Lynch are committed to.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectations about how this would be handled.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also consistent with the expectations of the American people in terms of how this should be handled.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read into the sort of social hanging out, if you will, between the Attorney General and the former President that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there and that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to worry about?\xc2\xa0 Should we read that much into this sort of gathering?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is entirely appropriate for journalists like you to ask the Attorney General what she talked about.\xc2\xa0 And she answered that question directly, on the record, as soon as it was asked.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Grandkids.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and whatever else.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think that\'s an appropriate question to ask, and I think it was appropriate for the Attorney General to answer it.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that no one is above the law, and everybody should be subject to the law in the same way without regard to their political affiliation or who\'s happened to endorse them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Library update, by chance?\xc2\xa0 There was some reporting that there might be a library announcement on location specifics today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any of those details.\xc2\xa0 The foundation that the President and First Lady have created will handle any announcements that they have to make on that matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Could I just ask something about Andrews again?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the importance of training and vigilance on military bases.\xc2\xa0 But does it make any sense to hold an active shooter drill so soon after a major terrorist attack when people might be on edge anyway, and when the Vice President is scheduled to be on the base?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Pam, I just don\'t know the details of the way that these kinds of drills are scheduled, so I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense for that.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the President believes that it\'s important to conduct drills and to do training that ensures the safety of our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on gun control, Speaker Ryan says that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to hold a vote on a bill to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns.\xc2\xa0 Does that give you hope that something like that might be able to pass?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the details here are rather important.\xc2\xa0 We saw claims from people like Senator Cornyn that the legislation that he had put forward would address the questions that many Americans have raised about the wisdom of allowing people who are on the no-fly list to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 So I think I\'d want to see the details before I commented on it.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the President has made this a priority.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve certainly been pleased to see congressional Democrats make it a priority.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is a simple one:\xc2\xa0 If it\'s too dangerous for you to board a plane, it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, is a pretty common-sense notion and is something that we believe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just get a vote, it should pass and be sent to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk so that he can sign it into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think public pressure is now kind of moving in that direction on members of Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I hope so.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s ample public evidence to indicate that a strong majority of Americans supports these kinds of common-sense steps.\xc2\xa0 They support these common-sense steps because they believe that it\'s likely to make the country a little bit safer and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s a pretty common-sense proposition.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not surprised to see that it\'s got strong public support across the country.\xc2\xa0 Not just a majority of Democrats, but according to some polls, even a majority of Republicans and a majority of gun owners support that kind of common-sense approach to making our communities a little safer from gun violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we\'ll see the details of what the House of Representatives is willing to consider, but this is a pretty common-sense notion and it\'s something that Congress should act on soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tGregory.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back in March, Lisa Monaco promised a report on civilian casualties by U.S. airstrikes in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 That was more than 16 weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any transparency on what\xe2\x80\x99s holding up that transparency?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously what the national security team and the intelligence community is attempting to do is to break some old habits, and bringing transparency to this element of our national security strategy and our counterterrorism strategy is difficult.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that that work is ongoing and has been ever since -- frankly, even before -- Ms. Monaco gave the speech that you\'re referring to.\xc2\xa0 That work is ongoing, and I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some additional information about that pretty soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be just a report on casualties, or do you expect the President to issue any executive orders, presidential policy directives, and sort of executive action clarifying the rules of engagement that limits civilian casualties?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any previews of the announcement at this point, but stay tuned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say both on this report but also with any potential executive orders, that the President is in these last few months of his -- the President has been trying to lock in the default policy choices for his successor?\xc2\xa0 For a Democrat, that means maybe making some tough choices and getting them off of her plate before she comes in.\xc2\xa0 Or for a Republican, to sort of lock in a policy that a Republican President would have to very conspicuously and deliberately rescind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\'m thinking specifically if there was an atrocities executive order, a Global Entrepreneurship executive order, all of which are things that this President has been doing all along. But issuing these kinds of things, executive actions, so late in his presidency -- are they an attempt to sort of set the plate for the next President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\'s hard to paint with that broad of a brush.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to our Cuba policy, for example, we\'ve made no bones about the fact that we are seeking to lock in that change in approach toward Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And so I think the description that you have applied would fit with what we\'re trying to do in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 In other situations, though, the situations that you\'re describing are just the culmination of years of work and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But going back to the atrocities executive order, the President already issued less formal guidance and has been operating under that system since the early days of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 Why formalize that as an executive order unless it\'s to bind his successor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, again, I also think it\'s possible to do both.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\'t read up lately on the executive actions around the atrocities report.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the President has made that kind of work a priority throughout his tenure as President.\xc2\xa0 And if there is an opportunity for us to routinize that approach to dealing with these complicated issues, the President believes the country would benefit from that.\xc2\xa0 After all, because that routinized approach didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist when President Obama took office, it required a lot of work to figure out how to most effectively deal with this policy challenge and be transparent about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so by establishing a procedure and a clearly delineated routine for implementing the strategy, yeah, I do think it makes it harder for somebody to undo, but it also means that kind of work continues to get the regular attention that the President believes that it deserves.\xc2\xa0 But I think ultimately that\'s the goal that we have in mind in trying to complete this important work before the President leaves office.</p>\n<p>\n\tGeorge.\xc2\xa0 Twelve wins in a row for your Indians, George.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t think I haven\'t been paying attention.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Much to my dismay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t lost since the Cavaliers won.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I keep hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did I notice that Cleveland had won -- anyway -- (laughter) -- I want to follow on your answer earlier about trade.\xc2\xa0 The President gave a very vigorous defense of trade agreements in Ottawa.\xc2\xa0 But with TPP and NAFTA and all trade agreements so under assault, are we going to be hearing a lot more of this from him in the coming weeks?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you will continue to hear from the President is a commitment to a set of policies that embraces the opportunities that lie ahead for the United States. And the President believes that that future is enhanced when we more effectively engage with the international community.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is true when it comes to trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 And the President described that rather colorfully yesterday in terms of the impact that shutting off all trade would have on our country\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President talked about the decimating impact that would have on the auto industry, for example.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s essentially a global supply chain.\xc2\xa0 And to shut off the United States from the global supply chain would have devastating economic consequences for the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think, George, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just apply to trade policy. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that we can achieve when we\'re willing to coordinate with other countries.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the climate announcements that were made in the context of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s summit are a very good example of that.\xc2\xa0 The United States cannot solve the problem of climate change alone.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, this was actually the principal line of criticism from those who were most skeptical of our approach to climate change.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 Remember there was this sense that why would the United States take all these steps to pursue a low-carbon economy if a country like China that\xe2\x80\x99s the largest emitter is not going to make the same kind of commitments?</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s only by engaging China and seeking common ground with them, and reaching those kinds of commitments in concert with them can we collectively address a challenge that has significant consequences for the planet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the same is true -- let me just give you one example, and I\'ll keep it quick -- which is just the effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That effort would not have been successful had the United States not been able to effectively work not just with our P5+1 partners, but with countries around the world -- like Japan and South Korea and India -- to help us implement those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 By implementing those sanctions against Iran we applied substantial pressure to their economy in a way that compelled them to come to the negotiating table and make specific commitments about not pursuing nuclear weapons that we can now verify, and essentially the United States and the rest of the world is safer because we now know that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was work that was only successful because of our ability to work effectively with the rest of the international community.\xc2\xa0 And if we were trying to shut ourselves off from the international community we would not have enjoyed that success.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could stick with trade for a second.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On trade agreements -- does he feel lonely out there arguing for trade agreements?\xc2\xa0 There aren\'t many voices being raised domestically on his side.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think some of that is a consequence of the current political climate.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think the President has shied away at all from any opportunity that he has to make the case about how important it is for the United States, both in terms of our economy but also in terms of our national security team, when it comes to pursuing an agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\'m not going to stand up here and make any character judgments.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that the President has the courage of his convictions when it comes to articulating a coherent strategy for making sure the United States can leverage our advantages in a way that benefits not just this generation of middle-class Americans, but future generations of working Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve got a lot of built-in advantages in this country.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got the best colleges and universities.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got the most -- we\'ve got a climate that rewards innovation and new ideas.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a society where good ideas can rise to the top.\xc2\xa0 And that gives us a competitive advantage over just about the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve also got a healthy, well-developed market for those products here in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of that combines to the give the United States a significant competitive advantage.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we try to press that advantage by entering into agreements with other countries to get them to raise their environmental standards, raise their labor standards, protect intellectual property, and give the United States better access to the markets in other countries so that we can actually have a chance to compete on a more level playing field.</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now you hear people who are opponents of the TPP say that globalization has had a terrible impact on workers across America.\xc2\xa0 The President is willing to acknowledge, and has on many occasions, that there are Americans -- even American communities -- that have been negatively affected by globalization.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question is:\xc2\xa0 What are you going to do about it?\xc2\xa0 The President is the one who has put forward a coherent strategy that makes sense, that leverages our advantages, maximizes our benefits, and creates additional opportunities for American businesses and American workers to succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tOpponents of these trade deals haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t put forward a coherent strategy.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that they have, that coherent strategy is one that would only promise economic ruin in the United States by attempting to sever the global supply chain.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the President has evolved or grown on this issue since the 2007 debate where he called for reopening NAFTA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Actually, George, I would say that the President is making good on that promise.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what the TPP does -- that Canada and Mexico are part of the TPP.\xc2\xa0 And what the TPP does is that it raises labor and environmental standards and makes them enforceable in a way that they were not enforceable in NAFTA.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t think the President has evolved on this promise; the President has made good on this promise, and in some ways has succeeded even more than he thought he would be able to.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon is lifting its ban on allowing transgender men and women to serve openly in the military.\xc2\xa0 Did the President weigh in on that decision?\xc2\xa0 Can you enlighten us a little bit about how he participates in conversations like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Christi, this is something that the Department of Defense is supposed to announce this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know if they\'ve done that while I\xe2\x80\x99m up here.\xc2\xa0 Presumably they have if you\'re discussing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can say about this is that what Secretary Carter announced today was the result of a review that was conducted at the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 In announcing that review, Secretary Carter indicated his belief that every American who is appropriately qualified to do so should be able to serve their country in the military, and that by having that kind of approach, our country is safer and our military is stronger.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees with that general approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the specific policy that was announced today, again, that\'s a policy that was formulated by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it yet.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to take a look at it before the end of the day today.\xc2\xa0 And we can either discuss at the end of today or in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you also update us on the President\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations about troop levels in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update at this point.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- including our military commanders on the ground in Afghanistan have been conducting a review.\xc2\xa0 And the last I heard, which is I guess a week or so ago, is that the conclusions of that review have not been presented to the President at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President will carefully consider not just the judgement of his military commanders on the ground, but also the other members of his national security as he continues to evaluate our strategy in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s something that he might reach a conclusion on or make a public announcement about before he meets with NATO leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements to foreshadow at this point, but if there is a policy change to announce, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that all of you are in the loop.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn Bennett.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senators Reid and Schumer mentioned a meeting today with Denis McDonough, Secretary Burwell and Donovan from OMB.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on that meeting?\xc2\xa0 And was Zika on the agenda today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the details of that meeting, but let me go ask about it and see if I can get you an answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Back to trade.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard the President express any concerns that him talking about it as regularly as he has recently could be politically -- could politically hinder Secretary Clinton and other Democratic candidates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think the President is worried about that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a different position on this issue than the Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve all been pretty blunt about that.\xc2\xa0 But look, the reason the President was talking about it yesterday is two of our most important trading partners were attending the summit alongside the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why he was discussing it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I think it served as a useful backdrop for illustrating how important it is to our country\xe2\x80\x99s economy and to our country\xe2\x80\x99s national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tFred, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A separate matter regarding transgender issues.\xc2\xa0 The National Park Service has said that restrooms on public lands will be open based on gender identity.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to see -- will that also be the policy for restrooms in all federal buildings?\xc2\xa0 Will that be sort of consistent with the directive to the public schools that was issued in May?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Fred, I have to admit that I can\'t speak to the bathroom policy of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 But I think you should check with individual agencies.\xc2\xa0 I can confirm for you that that\'s the policy here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is the policy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0END \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02:20 P.M.
