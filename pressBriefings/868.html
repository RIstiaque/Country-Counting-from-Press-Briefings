Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:46 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here we go.\xc2\xa0 Here we go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How\'s camp?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really can\'t talk about it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About what?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked about -- I took my son to his first overnight camp yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a big moment -- you say goodbye.\xc2\xa0 He\'s very excited.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\'s having a great time and I\'m not at all worried about it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- watching this now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, you can be sure no TV allowed, I hope.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAside from that, I will -- I\'m sorry, Connie, what?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the mother and father.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\'s supposed to write every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I have no other announcements.\xc2\xa0 But thank you for asking.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A few topics.\xc2\xa0 Consumer confidence in July was better but not nearly at the level of a healthy economy, a healthy level of confidence.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that public attitudes about the economy are set now as to where they\'re going to be in November, or is there a sense that there\'s still time for things to move in either direction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the way I would address that question, Ben, is simply to say that the President is not satisfied with where the economy is.\xc2\xa0 He knows that the American people, by and large, are not satisfied with where the economy is.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he\'s doing everything he can, and he is urging Congress to do everything it can, to take action to help the economy grow faster and to help it create more jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re in a situation now where Congress is about to leave town.\xc2\xa0 The House should act to pass the tax cuts for the middle class -- 98 percent of American taxpayers -- and do what everyone in Washington agrees should be done, which is to extend those tax cuts, pass that law, the President will sign it, and it will create certainty for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 It will give the economy certainty and it will help the economy grow faster and create more jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the President\'s central preoccupation.\xc2\xa0 And it is I think the central issue for the American people in this election year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\'s focused on it and that\'s why he continues to believe that while there are great disagreements -- and he talks about the stalemate that exists here in Washington, a stalemate that the voters can settle in November -- prior to that, there are things that we do agree on that we can act on:\xc2\xa0 tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think Republican Congressman Steve LaTourette has announced his resignation today, and he talked about his frustration over the fact that Congress finds itself arguing over no-brainers like building roads and bridges.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that the Republican Congressman and the President haven\'t agreed on all the issues, but they agree on this one -- Congress should pass legislation, as the President outlined in the American Jobs Act, that would put construction workers on the job building roads, bridges, highways, ports, schools.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the kind of thing that has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that pays benefits not just to the workers who are on the job, but to the broader economy in the near term because it generates economic activity, but also to the economy in the long term because better roads and bridges and highways, infrastructure helps our economy long into the future.\xc2\xa0 So this is, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s central preoccupation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is about to have a call about Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s trip abroad, but I wanted to see if the White House had any comment about how you see the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s trip as having gone, and whether it did anything to help or hurt his credentials.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the campaign can handle some of that, and I think that the press will make its own judgments.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, having been both a reporter covering foreign trips by candidates as well as incumbent Presidents, and now as a staffer, I understand that these are high-stakes enterprises; that pulling them off is a lot harder than it looks; that they can be very tense, especially if they\xe2\x80\x99re not going well, and -- (laughter) -- seriously, for reporters as well as staffers and the principal.\xc2\xa0 And I think one thing that the news reports remind us of is that when American Presidents, American senators and congressmen and would-be leaders go abroad, what they say is placed under a magnifying glass and it carries great impact.\xc2\xa0 And Presidents, senators, congressmen, former governors need to be very mindful of the impact because of the diplomatic implications of what you say overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo without offering a broad assessment, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to the campaign, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder that this is a high-stakes situation; that the job of President -- even though the focus in this campaign and the focus of this President at this time is on the economy, the job includes as an enormous part of it the exercise of national security policy and diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important part of the job, and getting it right matters greatly to America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world and to the successful execution of American foreign policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick one on a very different topic.\xc2\xa0 The House is scheduled to vote on a bill that would ban abortions in the District of Columbia after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about this particular piece of legislation, Ben, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive freedom is well known.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would note that, as I mentioned earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the verge of a recess here, and rather than focusing on controversial, divisive, social legislation, the House ought to be passing a tax cut for 98 percent of the middle class -- 98 percent of American taxpayers, for the middle class, that everyone agrees on.\xc2\xa0 That should be the focus of the House\xe2\x80\x99s work right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that everyone agrees on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can debate for the rest of this election cycle the merits of providing extended tax breaks to the top 2 percent of American earners, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an important debate to have.\xc2\xa0 You know the President\xe2\x80\x99s position; we know the other side\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s a situation where Republicans and Democrats agree -- and the President feels strongly about this -- that we should extend those tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And we should do that right away, and then debate about the issues that still divide us.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Reuters, and then -- yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 House prices rose for the fourth straight month in May, and -- an indication that the market is gaining strength.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if it\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment that the market has bottomed out, and how confident are you that the direction will continue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would leave the broader assessments about the state of the market to experts who analyze that.\xc2\xa0 This President has been very focused on taking every measure available, both administratively and legislatively, to assist homeowners who, through no fault of their own -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve been responsible, they met their mortgage payments, but they find themselves underwater -- helping them refinance.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been a very important initiative that this President has pressed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of the fact that the collapse of the housing market has contributed mightily to the great recession and has been a drag on the recovery.\xc2\xa0 So we need to continue to take the steps necessary to assist responsible homeowners to keep making their payments, to stay in their homes -- and obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a virtuous cycle here hopefully that begins to take effect gradually that will help lift the housing market and, with it, create some economic growth as a benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is still a difficult issue for many, many Americans who find themselves, again, through no fault of their own, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been very responsible, but find themselves underwater with their mortgages.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has been focusing -- focused on getting the kind of assistance to them so they can take advantage of historically low interest rates that Washington can help provide.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the improvement in prices reduce the urgency of debt forgiveness from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to that question.\xc2\xa0 I simply will say that we are far from where we want to be -- both broadly in the economy, as I was saying to Ben, but certainly in the housing market.\xc2\xa0 And I would -- I think it would be way premature to suggest that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take more steps to assist homeowners.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other question.\xc2\xa0 North Korea has had some quite serious flooding.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a U.N. team that\xe2\x80\x99s on the way there to assess the needs and put together an aid plan.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States involved in that discussion?\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan to contribute humanitarian aid to North Korea if they need it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any discussions about that issue here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I would probably refer you to the United States mission at the U.N. or perhaps the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, for North Koreans who are suffering, our hearts go out to them.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tWelcome, Nancy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You said that things can be tense when things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that the White House thinks that things for Mr. Romney on his overseas trip did not go well?\xc2\xa0 And is there anything that he said while he was abroad that was of concern to the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the assessments to the media and to others about his trip.\xc2\xa0 I was trying to make a broader point about the significance of foreign travel for Presidents, for would-be presidents, senators, congressmen, because of the weight of their words when they travel overseas and the impact it can have on the execution of U.S. foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Now, I think there are a number of things that have been said about the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy record that are inaccurate and that I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to contest, but I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Notably?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, on the issue of missile defense, it is very clear that this President has pursued aggressively the development and implementation of a missile defense program in Europe that includes, notably, an installation in Poland, and that, contrary to suggestions to the contrary -- contrary to suggestions from critics, the Russians continue to oppose and we continue to press forward with that missile defense program because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s based on tested technology, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the most effective missile defense program in terms of combating the threat from Iran.\xc2\xa0 That would be one issue where some of the criticism was off the mark, to say the least.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On birth control, your new mandate for insurance companies goes into effect tomorrow -- they have to add birth control coverage to their plans.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are already a number of challenges from businesses around the country on religious grounds.\xc2\xa0 Some of those challenges have been upheld in state courts.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that this is going to become the new front in the war over the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply point you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy and the position that he oversaw and had developed that ensures that these important preventive services are available to all women and that also respects religious liberty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, no religious institution, no university has to provide contraceptive services or -- and the President\xe2\x80\x99s position was very clearly that there needed to be that respect for religious liberty that created that balance while ensuring that women get these important preventive services.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re still implementing the rule, but I think the President sought and found the right position in terms of respecting religious liberty and making sure these services are provided.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think about these lawsuits that are going on all around the country?\xc2\xa0 How much does that hamper the administration\xe2\x80\x99s ability to implement this rule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on specific legislation or broadly -- I mean, litigation or even broadly on it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward to implement this important rule that will ensure that women across the country have access to preventive services.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a rule that also makes sure that religious liberty is respected.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is related to the Romney trip or not, but the President had a phone call yesterday with the Turkish Prime Minister and the White House put out a photo and the President was sitting at his desk on the phone and he had a baseball bat in his hand.\xc2\xa0 Or maybe you were traveling yesterday. But the official White House photo --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it aluminum or wood?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He had a baseball bat in his hand.\xc2\xa0 Do you know did he get that from a Major League player, or is there some sort of back story about the foreign policy approach or -- (laughter) -- he was holding a baseball bat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a baseball fan.\xc2\xa0 What can I tell you.\xc2\xa0 As I think he said, White Sox but also watching the remarkable Washington Nationals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you take the question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can find out, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) [The President is pictured talking on the telephone in the Oval Office holding an autographed baseball bat that was given to him by Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.]</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Perhaps it was a diplomatic gift?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the economy, there was a -- you talk a lot here at the podium about the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the balanced approach, and how many Americans agree with that.\xc2\xa0 There was a Gallup poll in the last 24 hours or so that suggested that government corruption, job creation, other issues like that are far more important on voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds right now.\xc2\xa0 And raising taxes was far down the list, I think around 8, 9, 10, in that range -- much further down the list.\xc2\xa0 How does that square with the claim that the American people support the balanced approach and that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of what they want in this election year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve mixed a bunch of different elements here.\xc2\xa0 I think the documentation and the data that shows support for a balanced approach is very conclusive.\xc2\xa0 What is also true is that the American people are principally focused on the economy writ large, and on job creation and their own economic situation.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that most Americans wake up every morning thinking about how to implement a balanced approach to long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It means that they want Washington to work in a way that helps the economy, helps it create jobs, and demonstrates the capacity of its leaders here to get America\'s fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when we talk about what\'s the right approach, overwhelmingly the answer is a balanced approach that includes significant spending cuts to discretionary spending; it includes entitlement reforms that, while saving money, also strengthen programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and it includes revenues.\xc2\xa0 And that is the conclusion not just of the President, but of every outside, independent, bipartisan commission that\xe2\x80\x99s looked at this.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the conclusion of the so-called Gang of Six, a bipartisan group of United States senators.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have so much work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done on this that there\'s not a lot of mystery about what it would take to achieve the amount of deficit reduction that would get control of our fiscal outlook, in excess of $4 trillion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s clear that the only way to do that without putting undue burdens on seniors, undue burdens on people who have children with disabilities, undue burdens on the middle class, is to do this in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the roadblock since last summer has consistently been a refusal by Republicans in Congress in anything like the numbers necessary to agree to the basic principle that everybody ought to pay their fair share, and a willingness to see the United States default, a willingness to see taxes go up on the middle class, a willingness to see defense cuts that are far deeper than anybody here in Washington thinks are responsible, all because of the principal judgment that what needs to be protected is tax relief for millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just, understandably, not a position that has a great deal of support among the broader American populous.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay -- and part of me knows the answer to the question, but I feel like I have to ask it anyway.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take it anyway.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everything is an extension now here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And I know you just went through a litany of reasons and you say it is all the Republicans fault.\xc2\xa0 But you just talked about sequester, and there is a tour going around -- John McCain is leading a tour on sequester.\xc2\xa0 And everything is -- do you guys have any responsibility here of the fact that we live in a town that only passes everything by six-month extensions?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou have a six-month extension on the budget.\xc2\xa0 Everything is about avoiding the next delay.\xc2\xa0 The sequester, everybody is finger-pointing now, but it\'s -- I mean, it is just a kick the can -- and I understand you just went through and said, hey, it\'s all their fault.\xc2\xa0 It\'s all their fault?\xc2\xa0 You guys have no responsibility on this whatsoever?\xc2\xa0 Should you be having more summits here?\xc2\xa0 Should you be forcing Boehner to just sit there and not answer you?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess is there a different way you guys should be going about this?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a fair question about what is the best way to bring about the kind of consensus that has been lacking.\xc2\xa0 And what I think all of us here have learned, and certainly those of us in the White House have learned, in the last year and a half is that getting things through this Congress that enjoy broad public support but which are opposed by a particularly powerful wing of the Republican Party, especially in the House, requires taking it to the people.\xc2\xa0 It requires making the argument out in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think you know, because you covered it, that we have tried it all ways -- both ways, if you will -- and that includes lots of negotiations and sitting across the table with leaders in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not precluding that in the future, but what we need is a demonstration of a seriousness of purpose by Republicans in Congress and a willingness to accept the premise that there needs to be balance in this.\xc2\xa0 There needs to be a willingness to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more, so that the middle class doesn\'t get stuck with the burden so that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last nine months you guys have had this sort of throw-up-your-hands approach.\xc2\xa0 You know what -- they\'re not willing to talk.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not willing to negotiate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But my point is that on a number of issues, including extension of the payroll tax cut, extension of unemployment insurance, including ensuring that student loans didn\'t double -- the rates didn\'t double for millions of young Americans across the country -- the President worked both here in Washington, but worked in raising the profile of these issues across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that had the effect, fortunately, of bringing about a vote in Congress that was the right one that broke the back, if you will, of what initially was opposition to the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what we believe can bring about consensus here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go back to the fundamental question:\xc2\xa0 Do you guys own any of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is President.\xc2\xa0 He has pushed a lot of policies.\xc2\xa0 He has implemented a number of policies, and very significant ones, that reversed the course economically that we were on in this country that was cataclysmic of economic decline that we hadn\'t seen since the Great Depression, of job loss that we hadn\'t seen in decades, and took other measures like what was considered political folly at the time to ensure that the American automobile industry was saved, as well as making sure that we didn\'t precipitate an even greater crisis by allowing the financial sector to collapse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, these were not -- these were tough choices, but they were the right choices.\xc2\xa0 And the President is responsible for those decisions and he stands by them.\xc2\xa0 And he is obviously running on that record.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what we\'re facing now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, he made -- this was part of the problem that we faced.\xc2\xa0 And I think you and others who are veterans around here understand the continuum that we\'re on here is that the President and -- not always with a great deal of alacrity -- his party has come along on these budget negotiations, on these debates about what the right course is on fiscal policy, and taken positions that represent real compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo trillion dollars in spending cuts -- that\'s a lot of spending cuts that this President signed into law.\xc2\xa0 He took positions on entitlement reforms that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are members of his party would rather he did not take.\xc2\xa0 But he was willing to do that because he believed that the greater good would be served by a compromise with Republican leaders in the Senate and the House, and the economy would be served by a bargain -- a grand bargain last summer that would have locked in the kind of long-term deficit reduction that would be beneficial for the country. That\'s the position he continues to take.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I take your point that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating that despite the overwhelming evidence that that\'s the right course of action, despite the demonstrated willingness of the President and Democrats to compromise and to come some distance towards Republicans, that there has yet to be in any significant numbers in Congress among Republicans a similar willingness to accept the principle that they\'re not going to get everything that they want, that they might reach a deal that could leave Grover Norquist unhappy.\xc2\xa0 But that is the only deal that\'s available that would protect the middle class, protect seniors, and ensure that our economy continues to grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of budget cuts, can you talk a little bit about why the President is going back to the same area of Akron, Ohio, tomorrow that he\xe2\x80\x99s visited before?\xc2\xa0 And in Mansfield, the local paper is reporting if President Obama has his way his Air Force One arrival would be one of the final flights into the Mansfield airport because the President wants to do away with the mission for the 800 guardsmen at the Mansfield --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that particular issue.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of why is he going to Ohio, I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, to that area of Ohio -- Mansfield and Akron.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he was just there on a bus tour.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not an inch of Ohio that the President does not love to visit.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great state -- my wife\xe2\x80\x99s home state.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of Mansfield, can we get you to take that question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of even the policy implications or what issue you\xe2\x80\x99re discussing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is a base -- or is a National Guard operation, Air National Guard operation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what this is in reference to, but if this is in reference to defense cuts that are related to the sequester, I think it\'s worth going back and looking at the vote on the Budget Control Act and all the Republicans, including those who are running around leading efforts to undo that vote, who voted for it because they said -- this was not -- the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t say, let\'s have a sequester.\xc2\xa0 He pushed a deal, a balanced approach to deficit reduction that would have resulted in all the positive benefits that I just talked about with Chuck.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Budget Control Act was the result of a failure by Congress to agree to a balanced approach to deficit reduction, and it was the result of Republicans willing to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States, willing to risk default, some of them even seemed to anticipate with glee the prospect of default.\xc2\xa0 And the President could not let that happen to the economy, to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And thus we got the Budget Control Act, which, in something that was designed by -- or with leaders in Congress, a sequester was written into law that included cuts that nobody wants -- not the President, not Democrats, not Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And the whole point of it was to create a forcing mechanism so that Congress would do its job.\xc2\xa0 Congress still needs to do its job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The PNTR, the Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia has passed through a couple of key committees on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 And Speaker Boehner said that if the administration wants it to pass through the House then the President needs to be out there and argue for it personally.\xc2\xa0 So my question is very simple.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that it\'s worthwhile to personally interfere in the situation and then do something about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has worked very closely, his administration has, with Congress on this matter and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that there\'s any dispute over that.\xc2\xa0 And the President will instruct the members of his Cabinet and administration to continue to do that, and we hope for congressional action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if there is no PNTR for Russia in two or three weeks, and Russia enters the WTO without the PNTR, what specifically do the American companies lose by it?\xc2\xa0 Because everybody knows that the American business lose -- but what specifically does it mean for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s a good question and I confess it\'s outside of my expertise, so I\'ll have to take it.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that we\'re working with Congress on this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, at the start of the briefing you were asked if the Romney trip has had any detrimental effect on foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 You eventually wound your way around to the missile defense comments and things like that.\xc2\xa0 Would you say specifically that that was detrimental to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that I can say that\xe2\x80\x99s detrimental -- at least not to the President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) But my point was that there were certainly things said about the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy record that were inaccurate or that we would contest.\xc2\xa0 And part of my job in speaking for the President is to contest inaccurate representations of his policy positions. So that was all.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the White House and the Obama campaign have made clear they feel that Bill Clinton is a very good messenger for President Obama on the economy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s now this ad out from the Romney campaign and the RNC using Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s words where he said that Romney had a sterling business career.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use your messenger as their messenger.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- on a matter purely of campaign advertising, I think you should ask the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed here on several occasions, President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s experience in office, his economic record, and the fact that the marginal tax rates for the top earners in America that were in place under Bill Clinton are the ones that President Obama believes we should return to, because we cannot afford to give another tax cut to the wealthiest 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 Those rates were in place when we saw the greatest peacetime economic expansion in our history and we saw the creation of 24 million jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a useful piece of recent history to examine when we hear protests from Republicans about the calamity that would ensue if the wealthiest 2 percent in America were asked to pay marginal tax rates at the level that they paid in the 1990s -- because some of those very Republicans made the same predictions in 1993 and they could not have been more wrong.\xc2\xa0 The facts prove them utterly wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it detrimental to the President that this characterization of Romney\xe2\x80\x99s career can be used, though, at a time when --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pure -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about a campaign ad that I confess I have not seen.\xc2\xa0 I think I know the comment you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to and I know everything else that President Clinton has said about it, so I would refer you to him and to Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then ancestry.com says that President Obama may be related to the first documented African slave in pre-revolutionary America -- a guy named John Punch, who was an indentured servant, who was sentenced to a life of slavery after an unsuccessful escape attempt in pre-revolutionary Virginia.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware that ancestry.com has said this and does he have any reaction to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that sort of came out yesterday and, as you know, I was traveling with my son.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had that discussion with him.\xc2\xa0 I have no idea if it\'s accurate.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is it certainly reflects the remarkable nature of our country and the diversity within it.\xc2\xa0 But again, I can\'t vouch for the findings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you ask him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I might.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAri.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Romney\'s speech in Poland, he said, "When economists speak of Poland today, it\'s not to lament chronic problems but to describe how this nation empowered the individual, lifted the heavy hand of government and became the fastest-growing economy in all of Europe."\xc2\xa0 And I wondered what you think of that assessment of the connection between lifting the "heavy hand of government," "empowering the individual" and fast economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that Poland\'s success have indeed been impressive.\xc2\xa0 And this administration has stood by our close ally, Poland, throughout the past three and a half years and worked with the Poles on numerous fronts -- both national security matters and global economic matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m not sure what your question is in terms of the broader themes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the suggestion being that regulation impedes economic growth -- the opposite -- empowering the individual promotes economic growth -- and that Poland is an example of the kind of economic proposals that Romney would put in place if he were President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\'s what I would say -- and it goes back to the answer I gave Briana about the Clinton years.\xc2\xa0 This President believes deeply in the power of business in America to create jobs; the importance of making sure that regulations that are in place do not hamper economic growth and job creation, even as they ensure the protection of the American people, of the air we breathe, the water we drink.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would say this:\xc2\xa0 What we know -- this is the beauty of the recent past here, and the stark clarity of the debate that we\'re having -- the rules that were in place in the 1990s, the tax rates that were in place in the 1990s, the rules and tax rates that were decried by many Republican leaders at the time had something to do with the greatest economic expansion and peace time in our history, had something to do with the creation of 24 million jobs over the course of 8 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe then tried the opposite approach for eight years; we had the slowest economic growth of any expansion in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 We had anemic job creation.\xc2\xa0 We had a situation that -- and if that weren\'t bad enough, then we had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tEverything that I have heard in this debate from the other side has been a call to return to the policies that we know from recent unhappy experience led to a very bad economic situation in this country -- particularly bad for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Everything we know about some of the policies that are opposed by the Republicans is that they were in place in the 1990s when we saw significant economic growth and significant job creation, and a level of expansion for the middle class and expansion of middle-class incomes that we would very much like to see again and that this President is focused on every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the debate we\xe2\x80\x99re having.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the debate that hangs over the kind of policy discussions that Chuck and I were talking about, and it is useful to have these two recent examples to compare.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a record out there that exists, and it includes the last three and a half years.\xc2\xa0 Again, when this President took office, when he was sworn into office in January of 2009, the economy was in freefall, hemorrhaging jobs 750,000 to 800,000 a month, economic decline of nearly 9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the situation that we faced in 2009.\xc2\xa0 And using a new metric put forward by a leading Republican, if we measure this President\xe2\x80\x99s performance after the first six months in office and his policies began to take effect, we think it shows sustained economic growth, sustained job creation.\xc2\xa0 Nowhere near where we need to be, but certainly a far better circumstance than the one we found ourselves in.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, now that it looks like the DNC will be adopting national gay marriage as part of their platform, will the embrace of that platform be a further evolution for the President on the issue of marriage equality?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President discuss his position and his personal view that it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to prevent couples who are in loving, committed relationships and want to marry from doing so.\xc2\xa0 With regards to the DNC platform, I think that issue is still being worked out, and I would refer you to the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when the President did discuss that issue, his focus was still on states dealing with it, and this would be something from a national perspective.\xc2\xa0 Would the President, based on what he said in those interviews at that time, would he embrace a national campaign to promote marriage equality?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re conflating a bunch of things about a discussion at the DNC about a party platform to a national campaign.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply refer you to what the President has said and what his personal views are, and then to the DNC for what I understand is a process that is still developing as regards to their platform.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I jump in here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that we have -- I broke the news yesterday on how platform committee on Sunday said to include the marriage equality plank in the platform.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if now that that establishes -- there are several Democrats down ticket who do not hold the view that they support same-sex marriage including Jon Tester in Montana, Tim Kaine in Virginia, and Claire McCaskill in Missouri.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that the adoption of that language in the platform should prompt these Democrats to reconsider a position as they pursue office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the DNC, Chris.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s, again, as I just said, an issue that\'s being developed in the usual fashion as they work on a platform, and I would send you there for that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Olivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new debate -- a renewed debate on Capitol Hill about the targeted killings policy.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering whether as a matter of principle, you think that the courts, the Congress, or the American people need to bless or endorse this policy, or what will they have in judging the policy and letting it go forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are aspects of that question that make it difficult for me to respond.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President takes the national security of this country very seriously and the fight against al Qaeda very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And he pursues policies that best -- that he believes are the right ones to protect the American people, to protect our interests and Americans abroad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I can\'t -- I think, broadly speaking in terms of some of these issues, you\'ve heard John Brennan and others discuss them. But without a more specific question, I can\'t really address that from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction then to the legislative proposals floating around the Hill --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen them, so I\'d have to have something more specific.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President stand on polygamy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does he stand on polygamy?\xc2\xa0 Could you answer that question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you want to dodge that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, last week I asked you if the President supported the amendment to the cyber security legislation that\'s being supported by Senator Schumer and other Democrats that would limit the purchase of high-capacity gun magazines.\xc2\xa0 Have you had a chance to talk to the President about this and whether or not he supports it?\xc2\xa0 Last week, you didn\'t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to him about it.\xc2\xa0 But I do know and have talked to him generally about his approach to this, which is that he believes we ought to take action on common-sense measures that protect the Second Amendment rights of the American people while making it harder for criminals and others who should not have weapons under existing law -- harder for them to obtain them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that any legislation that might emerge from Congress would have to -- would be viewed with those principles in mind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that the President talked -- spoke at the Urban League about the importance of having a dialogue, about cracking down on gun violence, has he moved any closer to deciding whether to hold any sort of gun policy event to open a dialogue about this any further?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no announcements to make in terms of his schedule or speaking plans.\xc2\xa0 But I would point you to the fact that he gave that address and to the fact that he spoke about the issue of violence at a higher level, that this is not just an issue of specific horrific incidents like that one that took place in Aurora, but the fact that we have levels of violence that are too high in many cities across this country, and that we need to address the problem from a variety of directions -- not just through legislation that relates to guns but through action that we could take and are taking in assisting local law enforcement, local government; action that we can take to ensure that teenagers who might be prone to or vulnerable to falling into gangs are instead in school or have summer programs that keep them off the streets.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of things that are part of a broader approach to dealing with violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess, what\'s the next step?\xc2\xa0 In addition to speaking about it at the union [sic] league, what\'s he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have -- the President has directed his Department of Justice to continue to take action, common-sense action that makes enforcement of our existing laws more effective, prevents criminals and others who should not have weapons from getting them.\xc2\xa0 And he will, I\'m sure, continue to hold the position that he talked about at the Urban League and talked about in Tucson and talked about in the op-ed that he wrote about the broader issues of violence and how we should address it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President watching any of the Olympics?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think whenever he gets a chance.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:31 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
