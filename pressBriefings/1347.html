<h1>Press Briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 5/21/10</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>See below for an answer to a question(marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n*As Mr. Brennan said, we don\xe2\x80\x99t deal with Hezbollah, Hezbollah is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). Our policy towards Hezbollah has not changed. We do not recognize separate military and political wings. Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and funding are fungible across all parts of the organization. All parties within Lebanon must adhere to their obligations under UNSCR\xe2\x80\x99s 1701 and 1559.</p>\n<p><br/>\n12:57 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- let\xe2\x80\x99s start today with a little bit of the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the President will deliver the commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point, in West Point, New York -- obviously laud the graduates for their accomplishments, their service to the country, discuss the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and outline some broad principles that will be in the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security strategy released later next week.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, the President has no public events scheduled.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will visit with Prime Minister Hariri of Lebanon at the White House.\xc2\xa0 This will be the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s first official visit to Washington during his premiership.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to consulting with the Prime Minister on a broad range of mutual goals in support of Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and independence, regional peace, and security.\xc2\xa0 Also on Monday, the President will host a reception to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, as part of National Small Business Week, the President will host award-winning small business owners from around the country for an event at the White House, where he will discuss the important role that small businesses play in our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on Tuesday, President Obama will welcome President Napolitano of Italy to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Italy, a leading NATO ally, have strong bilateral relations.\xc2\xa0 The President appreciates Italy\xe2\x80\x99s robust contributions to peace efforts around the world, and looks forward to continuing his consultations with the President following up on their July 8 meeting from last year in Rome.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Later on Tuesday, the President will travel to San Francisco, California, to headline events on behalf of Senator Barbara Boxer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will visit the Solyndra Incorporated solar facility in Fremont, California, where he will tour their 300,000 square foot high-tech facilities and make remarks to workers on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 Following his remarks, the President will return to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, President Obama will -- this is hard for an N.C. State graduate to say -- welcome the NCAA men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball champion Duke Blue Devils to the White House -- Reggie will be in rare form -- (laughter) -- to honor their 2009 and 2010 season.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and First Lady will also host a first-ever White House reception in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month, and we will have more details on Friday through the weekend later on.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ms. Loven.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 The Lebanon and Italy leader events remind me if we could ask you to have pool sprays with questions regularly?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I honestly don\'t have -- I don\'t know what the coverage is, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand -- I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re not telling me about those specifically, but it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a broad question that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to have pool sprays, including questions for most of these events, which you do not usually have.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on what the coverage is.\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, some of that is going to be very schedule-dependent.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for it not to be schedule-dependent, but to become more of a tradition like it used to be at the White House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 You and I should go see the scheduler, that\'s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re still meeting.\xc2\xa0 What -- I mean, do you have to like --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an extra five minutes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not really schedule issues.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking five minutes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about this offline.\xc2\xa0 There are -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to be in one of these that lasts five minutes, but I --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in one of those either.\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on BP, the President referred to it today as a disaster, a disaster in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if -- well, I guess if you could explain why the federal government isn\xe2\x80\x99t treating it like it would treat a normal disaster, where you should have come in and take charge.\xc2\xa0 I know you have the expertise at BP\xe2\x80\x99s level and the other companies, but why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the federal government sort of taking over this operation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through this question.\xc2\xa0 We went through this question yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, for reasons that were obvious in 1990, put the liability and the responsibility for recovery and cleanup with the company rather than with the taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking a financial question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking a management question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no -- no, no, but the management question is a financial question.\xc2\xa0 Understand --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for the cleanup and they have to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not two separate questions.\xc2\xa0 So it is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no legal way to sort of separate that out and say, we send the federal disaster experts --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the Oil Pollution Act -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to explain this many times.\xc2\xa0 They are responsible for, and we are overseeing that response.\xc2\xa0 That includes -- as I discussed yesterday, there are many different departments and agencies that are involved here.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Interior and what used to be the Minerals Management Service is in charge of regulation and drilling issues.\xc2\xa0 NOAA deals with a series of issues including water sampling, detection of oil inside the water.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Homeland Security is where the Coast Guard is housed.\xc2\xa0 The Coast Guard obviously was on the scene right after the original explosion, and Thad Allen, the head of the Coast Guard, is the National Incident Coordinator.\xc2\xa0 The Environmental Protection Agency does air and water quality testing.\xc2\xa0 And once oil hits land, they have purview over that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear that I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, that you\xe2\x80\x99re legally not allowed to take sort of command and control of the whole situation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- Jennifer, they are responsible for and we are overseeing the recovery response.\xc2\xa0 I will add that SBA is also in the area dealing with disasters for fishermen because NOAA has closed 19 percent of the Gulf for fishing.\xc2\xa0 And SBA is there to provide low-interest loans for people that have had economic damages as a result of that disaster.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But understand, Jennifer, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve also said on a number of occasions, the technical expertise to clean up and deal with the equipment that is 5,000 feet below the surface of the sea, that\xe2\x80\x99s equipment that BP has; that\xe2\x80\x99s the equipment that other oil companies have.\xc2\xa0 That is not based on equipment that the federal government has in storage.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let this go because I\xe2\x80\x99m using up my time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not really the question I was asking, is whether you\xe2\x80\x99re physically doing the work.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking why you don\xe2\x80\x99t take control of the whole operation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m just not being -- over the course of several weeks have not been clear on this.\xc2\xa0 It is their responsibility.\xc2\xa0 They have the legal responsibility and the technical expertise to plug the hole.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Chu, Secretary Salazar, Secretary Napolitano, and others, have been involved in efforts with other scientists, both government and nongovernmental scientists, in conjunction with British Petroleum, which has been working in conjunction with other corporations and other oil companies.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess -- I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to try to sift through the question.\xc2\xa0 I just -- they are responsible and we are overseeing to ensure that what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they\xe2\x80\x99re not getting the job done, does the government just stand there as a spectator and hope for the best?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that would denote that the federal government has stood there and hoped for the best.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the premise of your question doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match any single -- hold on, let me finish this.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re confident they\xe2\x80\x99re getting the job done?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me finish this.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match any single action that our government has undertaken since the call came in that this rig had exploded in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 So, you know, the premise of your question doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit any of the actions that are currently happening on behalf of the federal government in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole problem here with BP in that every piece of information that they\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered -- every piece of information hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been -- has turned out not to be true when it comes to the amount of oil that\xe2\x80\x99s spilling, how many leaks there were, I mean, and every single -- so you guys are having to rely on them -- and I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re legally responsible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we are --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The government has to rely on them for the technical expertise, I understand that, but do they have the credibility any more?\xc2\xa0 I mean, why not just say, you know what, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re running this thing; you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t running this thing -- we\xe2\x80\x99re running it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Chuck, we are overseeing the response -- okay?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what you think -- we are working each and every day.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why Secretary Chu -- the Department of Energy -- it sounds technical -- the Department of Energy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have purview over oil, oil drilling.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not in their governmental sphere.\xc2\xa0 But Secretary Chu has been down there working through a whole host of ideas, including enhanced imaging to get a better look at a disaster that\'s 5,000 feet underneath the water.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have taken every step.\xc2\xa0 We have pushed relentlessly for BP to do what is necessary to contain what is leaking, to deal with both the environmental and the economic impacts of what, as the President said today, is unquestionably a disaster.\xc2\xa0 One of the questions you asked, Jennifer, was, this is not something -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- you may have been -- be confused about the notion of a disaster declaration that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s something analogous to that, where you could just -- like an AIG or a disaster where --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- the Oil Pollution Act is where -- the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is what governs how one responds to and who pays for a spill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then when I asked if you\xe2\x80\x99re legally non-able to step in and take actual control, you said, no.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just confused.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m confused at what are you -- what are you asking then.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If BP is not accomplishing the task, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the federal government come in and take over and get the job done?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that they can --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Federalize it -- can you just federalize it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- let me just -- I also want to address Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 BP is working -- and I would refer you to BP on the actual efforts that they\'re undertaking and they will undertake as the course of this weekend -- different ideas on how to stop the leak both out of the pipe, which they\xe2\x80\x99ve done through the insertion tube, as well as what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the riser.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would say relating to some of the earlier questioning, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked them to provide more public data on air and water quality, and we asked them 10 days ago and reiterated in a letter yesterday to provide video footage of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening 5,000 feet underneath the sea --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you order them to do that rather than ask them?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that from a private company.\xc2\xa0 We -- the information -- first of all, the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had the authority to tell AIG what to do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You took over AIG.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we -- the company is largely in receivership.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I know, but I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a way to declare some sort of emergency --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hate to -- let me just get through -- let me get through Chip\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip, that\'s proprietary video that was in the Joint Information Center and was working through -- the command had the video in order to see for the response efforts that we were doing on -- in conjunction with them, that video is now public.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I ask --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It took 10 days.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask about Dennis Blair.\xc2\xa0 Will James Clapper be replacing him either temporarily or permanently?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk more about the process during which the President lost confidence in Mr. Blair?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me discuss -- first of all, the Director will resign, as he said, effective next Friday.\xc2\xa0 The Deputy Director at DNI will become the Acting Director.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked to a number of well qualified candidates and will make an announcement on who the next permanent DNI will be soon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just soon?\xc2\xa0 That\'s as much of a timeframe as you\xe2\x80\x99re going --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into names or timelines.\xc2\xa0 Look, my guess is there is probably no harder job in Washington, besides being President, than being Director of National Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 The coordination across many different intelligence agencies is -- and given the fact that this job was simply -- was just created only a few years ago means that Director Blair had to bring some clarity to the challenges that the DNI has.\xc2\xa0 He has done that.\xc2\xa0 The President is thankful for his continued service to the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The act that set this up, again -- what I mean by that is the act that set this up put off some of the more difficult questions legislatively for the DNI to have to go through.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Blair did that in, again, working through questions like budget authority, working through questions like chief of station representation.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are a number of things, obviously, that Admiral Blair did.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we continue to have as a result -- and we saw this, that the President identified on the attempted Christmas Day bombing -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s still coordination issues that we have to work through.\xc2\xa0 The President simply believed that it was time to transition to a different Director of National Intelligence, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an announcement on a permanent replacement soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk more about what led to the decision.\xc2\xa0 Are there any --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- I think I outlined basically where the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking is on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration won a court victory today about Bagram, basically giving it -- affirming that the Obama administration can pick up anywhere in the world except for the United States a non-citizen of the United States and hold them beyond the process of the court.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how that comports at all with the language that President Obama used on the campaign trail when he was talking about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I know Counsel was working on a response to some of these points, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that as soon as I get out of here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you were asked about comments that John Brennan made about trying to build up the more moderate elements of Hezbollah.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked John for that, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten anything back from him.*</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have -- does the President have any concerns at all about President Calder\xc3\xb3n criticizing American laws at Congress or from the lawn of the White House?\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans have objected --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think Ann asked me that yesterday and -- look, I know that President Calder\xc3\xb3n has strong feelings about -- particularly about the Arizona law, on the belief that we should have strong, comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President shares his concern on both those aspects.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not inappropriate at all?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the Mexicans to see if they think it\xe2\x80\x99s inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I simply think the President has similar concerns with those laws.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On BP, there is an official who said -- from BP -- who says that he expects that the leak would be plugged some time next week, as early as next week.\xc2\xa0 How much confidence does the White House have in that timeline, that they could actually get this --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to undergo -- and they can explain the technical nature of this better -- the process of trying to clog this leak with heavy mud, injecting that into the system I think beginning sometime this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to them in terms of the degree to which they think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be successful.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work on with them ideas for how to both plug and contain what is leaking, even as BP begins to drill a longer-term solution through a relief well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re telling you, this is what we think will work.\xc2\xa0 What is the confidence level from the White House?\xc2\xa0 Do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to stop this by next week?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly hopeful, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then back to Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s question -- I mean, if they can\xe2\x80\x99t, does there come a point when the White House has to say, listen, we need to take charge of this -- not just from an oversight point of view; we\xe2\x80\x99re going to step in and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring in whatever --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The National Incident Coordinator in Thad Allen, agencies throughout the government, have been working on the ground since right after this explosion in the Gulf to do all that we can to plug this leak; to contain what was leaking; to deal with what happens in the event, and as we have seen, that that oil gets to land; we now know some of that oil has begun to get into the loop current, and how do we deal with that; sampling -- water quality sampling and how we deal with both surface and subsea dispersants.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been there every day of this crisis, and we will stay there until this hole is plugged, until we deal with what is either in the water or on the surface, and the impacts of that both environmentally and economically, which will probably take quite some time to sift through.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hang on a second, hang on -- but you will still just be essentially assisting in any way possible as many times as they want to keep trying something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work?\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to walk in --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll try something else.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, Dan, this notion that the government is simply waiting and seeing -- again, Dan, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea of how to plug this hole, I\'m happy to put you in charge of -- with John Holdren here, with Secretary Chu, or somebody at the Joint Information Command.\xc2\xa0 Everything --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that the White House has, that this administration has --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Everything that can be done is being done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have scientists here and throughout the administration that are working on trying to make that happen.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the questions about federalizing --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have another question, actually, on something else.\xc2\xa0 After the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cunderwear bombing,\xe2\x80\x9d the President talked about the failures, and I think you characterized it as coordination issues.\xc2\xa0 But he also talked about pushing for solutions to fix the problem.\xc2\xa0 What is the sense here in the White House about intelligence sharing and the analysis of intelligence?\xc2\xa0 How does the White House feel that the various agencies are sharing information or analyzing it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the President took responsibility for that lack of coordination and information sharing on Christmas Day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since then, has it gotten any better?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The improvements that were -- the problems that were identified and the improvements that John Brennan and others have begun to put into the system have improved it.\xc2\xa0 We will -- Dan, the President has asked every member of the intelligence community and the national security team to evaluate our processes every day to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that can possibly be done better.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the intelligence community and the national security teams do each and every day.\xc2\xa0 We strive to get it as good as it can be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d love to get at least initially a yes or no answer to this question.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with BP\xe2\x80\x99s response?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is not satisfied that we\xe2\x80\x99ve plugged a hole in the floor of the ocean that\xe2\x80\x99s leaking a barrel -- thousands of barrels of oil a day and polluting the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with BP?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to push BP to do everything that they can.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, no \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d on whether you\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with BP.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought I gave you a fairly fulsome answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have full confidence in BP?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we are asking BP to do -- to take the steps that we believe are necessary.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have another question.\xc2\xa0 You sent out that Tweet about -- it was 10 days between the time you first asked for the live video and when you got the video.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 May 11th.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the other hand, which sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re asking without any kind of power behind it at all, and on the other hand you say you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your boot on their throat.\xc2\xa0 That sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re wearing the boot if they can just go along for 10 days.\xc2\xa0 I mean, seriously, Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s this growing perception that the United States, that the government is somewhat powerless to make BP do what it wants them to do if it can\xe2\x80\x99t even get them to put a live feed of video up for 10 days.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, we have pushed them to make things more public.\xc2\xa0 There are laws that govern the proprietary information of companies.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t change each and every one of those laws, Chip.\xc2\xa0 We will work every day to ensure that BP is doing everything that it can do, everything that we believe it should do.\xc2\xa0 We asked again yesterday that they make more transparent their air and water quality samples, that they update their website on that on a daily basis, that they provide live video footage of what is happening on the floor of the ocean 5,000 feet beneath it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to push any company, and the President and the team here will continue to push all elements of the government, to get this right.\xc2\xa0 We are facing a disaster, the magnitude of which we likely have never seen before, in terms of a blowout in the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything humanly possible and technologically possible to deal with that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly on financial regulation --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I got to get to somebody else.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you like Blanche Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, let me give somebody else another turn.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, you just said about the air and water quality, that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing the testing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the EPA doing the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no -- again, EPA does air and water quality testing.\xc2\xa0 NOAA does water quality testing.\xc2\xa0 They also do testing and we\xe2\x80\x99re asking them to make public their samples of that testing.\xc2\xa0 The EPA --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the EPA rechecks the tests, and does their own?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And does -- they do their own testing, yes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all up on a website if you want to look at water -- air and water quality samples.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano is still the person I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s overall in charge.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the National Incident Commander has been for several weeks Thad Allen and, again, as I said -- well, let me, because -- I\xe2\x80\x99m apparently not being clear.\xc2\xa0 Thad Allen has postponed his retirement from the Coast Guard to continue on as the National Incident Commander.\xc2\xa0 A new Commandant of the Coast Guard will be put in.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to focus on their job while Admiral Allen focuses on -- as the overall National Incident Commander, as is required by law.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you guys confident that Secretary Napolitano is not being taken too much away, considering the other part of her job at Homeland Secretary?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the Coast Guard is part of DHS --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s some equity there.\xc2\xa0 Again, the National Incident Commander is Thad Allen -- okay?\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano certainly has equities in this based on the fact that DHS is there.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar has equities because of DOI and MMS.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Commerce is where NOAA sits -- they have equities in this.\xc2\xa0 The Environmental Protection Agency has equities.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, but are you at all -- is there any concern here that she\xe2\x80\x99s being taken away --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Based on what?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just how much time she has to spend here, she had to testify on the Hill, and considering the Times Square -- that she\xe2\x80\x99s being taken away from any of her duties having to do with --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anybody say that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question on DNI.\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought being considered of getting the position itself restructured, going back to Congress and saying, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned, maybe it ought to be structured like this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I have not heard discussions today about greater intelligence reform at this point.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys are still confident that this structure is the right structure?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the government continues to work through the challenges that the law and the position have always presented to government and in the coordination of many different agencies and departments and the intelligence functions that they represent.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, this is a -- this is an extremely difficult job for any person to do, and we think that Admiral Blair did a great job.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a Intelligence Advisory Board, Chuck Hagel and some others serving --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 President\xe2\x80\x99s -- PIAB -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligence Advisory Board.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they being asked to look at the structure of this?\xc2\xa0 And will they make -- could they be making recommendations about how the DNI should be structured?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They have been -- they have been asked, and they did.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you have to go to Congress with?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I read the report again last night and I don\'t remember that that was the case.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I ask you a question, a follow-up question?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get around here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as this immigration problem is concerned, how seriously you think President thinking this is a -- really time has come to do something?\xc2\xa0 This is a serious problem and also as far as supply and demand.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As far as?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Supply and demand.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Goyal, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President on a number of occasions -- certainly this week with President Calder\xc3\xb3n here -- reiterate his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, understanding that this is not something that he can implement alone, this is not something that can be implemented by simply one party, and that those that have traditionally supported immigration reform on both sides are going to have to do that again.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to create a solution without the bipartisan help of members of the House and the Senate that have worked on this before.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I just follow-up on that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me come around.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as freedom of press is concerned, more than half of the countries are not free as far as freedom of press is concerned.\xc2\xa0 I know the President signed the Freedom of the Press Act, but do you think President is thinking of signing a Freedom of Press Act week to celebrate?\xc2\xa0 Because press is really a bridge between governments and the people, and what do you think for a press --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Goyal, I would simply say that I think this was a fitting week to sign a bill that adds freedom of the press to the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s study of human rights and the role that it plays in a free society.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What options does the U.S. realistically have to punish North Korea?\xc2\xa0 And what response has the U.S. gotten from China?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- there are several -- obviously, you know that the Secretary is in the region.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to add to what I said yesterday, but we continue to consult with the South Koreans.\xc2\xa0 I know they had -- they had some emergency meetings last night and yesterday, based on the report that came back, providing responsibility for what happened to the North Koreans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the administration push to have the Consumer Protection Agency stand alone, as Barney Frank wants?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think what -- the President met with Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank today to -- first, I think to congratulate them for their effort.\xc2\xa0 We have -- I think many people might have believed at the beginning of the year and certainly into February that getting financial reform done this year wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, and that certainly having a strong consumer protection portion of this -- having the Volcker rule, limiting the size and scope of the activities that banks can be involved in and regulating derivatives was not something that -- we\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky to get one of those and were likely to get none of those in a final piece of legislation that passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Throughout this process, the legislation has gotten stronger.</p>\n<p>In term of consumers, the bill is very strong in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to go through each of these provisions together, the conference committee will, in making some of those decisions.\xc2\xa0 We think it is important that there be less the address and more the independence of the consumer agency in having its own budget and its own leadership.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, that many families in this country, their interaction with our financial system is through the many things that this area would regulate, whether that\'s getting a loan for a car, getting a loan for a house, getting a credit card.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the very type of protections that the American people need the most.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about timing and strategy?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, broadly on timing, I think both members and the President believe we can get something done by the Fourth of July.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Dennis Blair, were you suggesting to us that he solved the problems that necessarily come with that position because of the ambiguity of the law, or will the next DNI still face those ambiguities and statutory limitations?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think many DNIs beyond whoever is next will deal with some of the vagueness and many of the complexities.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that -- I don\'t think anybody here, and I certainly don\'t think, recalling the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks after the attempted bombing on Christmas Day, that we don\'t have improvements that we continually have to make in our intelligence system.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe this is a naturally unwieldy process, having a strong CIA director and a DNI and an inside White House counterterrorism advisor, that inevitably there will be turf battles, inevitably there will be either disputes or disagreements about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- who has authority or --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand -- no, no, no, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the principal intelligence advisor for the President of the United States is the Director of National Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 The Director of National Intelligence and their department produce each day the President\xe2\x80\x99s daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 The President begins each of those days both with that briefing and either with the Director of National Intelligence or employees of the Director of National Intelligence in order to go through the President\xe2\x80\x99s daily briefing. So there\xe2\x80\x99s no ambiguity as to who the principal intelligence advisor to the President of the United States is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President ask Leon Panetta to consider becoming DNI?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into personnel replacements.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the House Armed Services Committee voted 59 to nothing to move forward the defense authorization bill.\xc2\xa0 It contains language that denies all funding to build or convert any facility of the United States for Guantanamo Bay detainees.\xc2\xa0 How far does this set the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal back of closing Guantanamo?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, the committee asked for a report on and some ideas on exactly how a facility might be structured.\xc2\xa0 That report and details will be going up to Congress.\xc2\xa0 I will say --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on a timetable.\xc2\xa0 I will say that we have always maintained that we need increased prison facility, and I think the law prevents the Department of Defense from -- but not the Department of Justice -- from purchasing such a facility.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the Gulf oil spill, I want to ask it this way -- is there anything that in the process of dealing with this, you have found in the 1990 law that limits the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s authority in ways you wish it did not?\xc2\xa0 Anything incumbent?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of except what we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked -- obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve set up -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve sent up structures that change liability in order to ensure that a disaster of this magnitude is not -- the economic damages are -- that are going to be -- that our citizens are going to suffer through are adequately compensated even if they\'re beyond the $75 million liability threshold that the law currently has.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the law itself has not created limitations that you wish did not exist?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will look through the exact legislation that was set up and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything as a part that\'s in there.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in talking a lot about the structure of the DNI job, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m confused about is, is the problem here then the DNI job or the person who filled the DNI job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this, that I think the job is very challenging.\xc2\xa0 I think Director Blair took on a number of those challenges that the law and the job presented.\xc2\xa0 Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t always easy to take on.\xc2\xa0 I think Director Blair also dramatically focused our government on counterterrorism and radicalization and rightly increased our focus on Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in pursuing terrorists that seek to do our country harm.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that at this point a transition in who that person is, is the best for the country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you just said that \xe2\x80\x9cWe think Admiral Blair did a great job.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why then is it the time for a transition?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, because I think we have -- some of the challenges that continue -- that we have to continue to take on, the President simply believes it\xe2\x80\x99s time to make a change.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, can you give us any elaboration on why?\xc2\xa0 I mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve just gone through all these ideas about what Admiral Blair did that you think were good, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a change.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President simply believes that where we are and what we have to do moving forward, that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to make a change there.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you disagree with his theory that the President lost confidence in him?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, that was my question.\xc2\xa0 Are you disputing all the various people who have said, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost confidence?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President -- the President decided to make a change.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let that speak for itself.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How often did Blair -- did Director Blair actually come and do the Presidential daily brief?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that number in front of me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Most of the time?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can -- I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I can see if there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Robert, can I just come back on one other thing.\xc2\xa0 A number of people have said this is a sign that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence apparatus is in disarray.\xc2\xa0 Would you like to dispute that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who said that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Op-ed pieces.\xc2\xa0 I mean I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got -- I don\'t have a list.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, do you have a list?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a list.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 Peter -- you know he would except his iPad buddy you can see is conspicuously absent.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s my researcher.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You really think that nobody said that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- no, I was just asking to take on -- rather than something broader than maybe the proper --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s very helpful.\xc2\xa0 I can report that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 Report that I changed the premise of your question based on -- no, no, I -- there are a series of laws and structures in this country that provide for a very robust intelligence effort by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that in any way we lack any sort of capacity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing different challenges based on, in many ways, some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing overseas, without getting more specific.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at what is -- what the intelligence community has been able to do in tracking Zazi, in identifying and tracking Headley in Chicago -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of things that the intelligence community does each and every day that aren\xe2\x80\x99t discussed in the newspapers that the American people can have great confidence in.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Congressman Peter King\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Blair was made a scapegoat for other failures here?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the basis for that is, given the fact that -- I think the President spoke pretty clearly and took direct responsibility for the failures in coordination and in information sharing that we saw around the Christmas Day -- attempted Christmas Day bombing.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that anybody has shirked that responsibility, they clearly haven\xe2\x80\x99t been paying attention to what the President has said and quite frankly what each member of the intelligence committee has had to say as a result of what happened on Christmas Day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a follow-up on the Calder\xc3\xb3n question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly a month since S.B. 1070 was passed, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how much longer does the DOJ need from President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s orders to decide on whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll file a lawsuit based on the constitutionality of the law?\xc2\xa0 How much longer will -- President Calder\xc3\xb3n will need to hear from President Obama about the lawsuit?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that question is better directed to the Department of Justice, which is working on that report.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who runs the Joint Command Center down in the Gulf?\xc2\xa0 Is that a federal government --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the Joint Information Center and the Command Center -- I mean obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 BP doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 They have a center I believe in Houston.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hold on, I got to -- I get beat up because I only take the first two rows.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House Armed Services Committee last night voted to ban funding for modification and construction of detention centers on U.S. soil.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think I did that a little while ago.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While I was reading about it here?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, could you -- but could you just say is -- should the state be proceeding with its plans still to do the purchase?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think when the transcript is out, I think Major asked that question and I answered it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the BP oil spill, is the federal government exerting as much control as legally possible --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in your oversight?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll just finish my question for the sake of finishing it --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I can say yes to the first part.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any powers that the federal government has held off on using either because you feel --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that it would be disruptive or send the wrong message about government interference in private business?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Meaning what?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sort of level of control or oversight that you could assume that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you have not yet assumed?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, the premise of your question is somehow the federal government is not doing everything that is humanly possible to stop the leak.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- okay, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to premise that in a political fashion.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking a technical question --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not reading it in a political fashion.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be flip here, but that\'s -- inherent in your question was that we\xe2\x80\x99re -- that somehow -- you\xe2\x80\x99re asking whether or not we think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing -- there\xe2\x80\x99s something we could be doing that we\xe2\x80\x99re not --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing for a good reason, I mean, is what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0 The government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come at something with everything in the playbook all the time unless you think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking because I don\'t know the answer.\xc2\xa0 Are there powers that theoretically you have that you have chosen not to exercise --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Theoretical powers?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there powers that you have chosen not to exercise yet because you think it would be unwise, but that you have in your back pocket as something additional you could throw out to clean up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, again, we\'re doing everything humanly and technologically possible.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we follow the law.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s inherent in -- or at least if it\xe2\x80\x99s not, I\'d like to make it overt -- obviously we\'re following the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 As you requested, I\'m following up on my question Monday about no-bid contracts.\xc2\xa0 I only read the preliminary reports then --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not held up my end of the bargain.\xc2\xa0 Come on Monday and I\'ll hold up my end of the bargain.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And I beg your pardon, but I only had the partial story then, so just -- should I ask you on Monday?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this on Monday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the moment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, 1965 Voting Rights Act was put in place to give blacks first-class citizenship.\xc2\xa0 And does Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the Civil Rights Act give pause to the wave of racial discourse currently taking place and what could eventually be challenged, a challenge to it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Give me the second part -- the wave of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Racial discourse, conversation about race right now that\'s going on, especially after his comments.\xc2\xa0 I mean, ever since really this President has come on the national stage with his efforts of running for office and then becoming the first black President -- I mean, what do you think about -- what\xe2\x80\x99s being said about Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s comments around here?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said yesterday, this was -- the laws passed in 1964 and in 1965 are -- while we continue to improve race relations in this country, they are debates that have been rightly and correctly settled many decades ago.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that somehow in 2010 we\'re debating whether or not all of our citizens ought to enjoy equal opportunity, something that I think many believe was rightly settled in 1964 and 1965 and 1968, has, as I said yesterday, no place in -- or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any place in our debate right now.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve -- those were very difficult times and we dealt with them and we settled many of those issues in landmark legislation that continues to serve this country and all of its people well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think we\'re having this conversation because of the first black President, who some in this White House have said race and politics will always follow him.\xc2\xa0 Do you think we\'re hearing more --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we\'re having the current conversation because in 2010 you had somebody who seemed to -- not seemed to -- called into question whether or not it was appropriate for a private company through a lunch counter to discriminate against a group of citizens in this country.\xc2\xa0 Again, in 1964 and in 1965 and in the preceding years, we\'ve settled those issues.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why we\'re having the current conversation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back on BP really fast.\xc2\xa0 Back on the current questions, basically are all federal options on the table -- going back to that question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Such as?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meaning, are you going to take more of an aggressive role in oversight?\xc2\xa0 I mean, like yesterday on CNN --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that we think can and should be done that isn\xe2\x80\x99t being done.\xc2\xa0 Nothing.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, will there be any efforts to try to change that?\xc2\xa0 Because, I mean, many people have been talking about this comment from the EPA Administrator yesterday on CNN.\xc2\xa0 She was asked by I guess Wolf that if there is -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the relationship with BP and the federal government.\xc2\xa0 She said, \xe2\x80\x9cTrust but verify.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And so many people are saying if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to verify, there\xe2\x80\x99s no trust.\xc2\xa0 So with that, again, will you try to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a monitor that follows our relationship with countries around the world, not just with companies that do business in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the explanation of historical \xe2\x80\x9ctrust but verify,\xe2\x80\x9d but again, we have -- BP has the obligation and responsibility to plug the hole in the floor of the ocean and to respond to the oil that has leaked out -- with our oversight, the strong oversight and strong response that we\'ll continue to exercise.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Coming back to BP, and not to be presumptuous about some of the other questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a -- BP\xe2\x80\x99s response from the get-go.\xc2\xa0 One of the first things they did was they tried to buy people off with five grand if they wouldn\'t pursue future liability.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of information --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the Attorney General of Alabama and -- as well as we communicated through this administration that trying to hire people to -- trying to hire fishermen that couldn\'t fish anymore because NOAA had closed part of it, asking them to help and paying them to lay boom but then prohibiting them from, as fishermen, ever filing economic claims was not the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t gotten to the question yet.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that\'s the first thing they did.\xc2\xa0 And in general, there\xe2\x80\x99s the sense that they provide information with an eye-dropper.\xc2\xa0 And then the video --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which is why we\'ve asked them to be more transparent about air and water quality samples and about a video footage of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening 5,000 feet beneath the sea.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, but the video on CBS the other night of Coast Guard officials on that ship with what were described as BP contractors threatening to arrest journalists for merely taking pictures -- all of this put together --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about 60 Minutes?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m talking about it was on -- Chip would know -- it was on -- and so all of this paints --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not see the particular --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They threatened to arrest a CBS crew for taking pictures -- for daring to take pictures --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they said that BP had told them that they --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all of this paints --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who was threatening to arrest?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were two agents on the boat, too.\xc2\xa0 It was a BP boat and BP had --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the Coast Guard being co-opted with BP officials and threatening the arrest of journalists for trying to take pictures?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look at the story.\xc2\xa0 Other than -- I\'d have to look at what CBS reported.\xc2\xa0 I just haven\'t seen that story.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In the spirit of Peter Baker and maybe more homework over the weekend, I wanted to go back -- I asked you about the landmines treaty, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get something on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sixty-eight senators have asked the President to sign --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, right, right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Monday?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or later today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want any homework over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys were very prescriptive in the latter days of the financial regulatory reform negotiations.\xc2\xa0 In the Senate you weighed in on specific amendments.\xc2\xa0 Do you intend to play that kind of interventionist role during the conference committee?\xc2\xa0 And where do you stand specifically on these various competing derivatives proposals?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t think that that level of detail was gotten into today with the President and the two chairs.\xc2\xa0 They talked more broadly about the strength of the bills.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that the -- I\'m sure that as we go through -- as Congress goes through to look at and compare provisions, we will have an opportunity to weigh in, and I\'m not going to get ahead of that process.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some individuals who say that the derivatives proposals in the Senate bill would trim 20 percent off of bank profits.\xc2\xa0 Do you buy that number and do you think that that\'s a genuine concern?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the basis is for that number.\xc2\xa0 Again, we -- the proposal the President put forward in the white paper last year called for pulling the type of activities that we\'re talking about out of the dark and into the light, putting them on exchanges and regulating those exchanges.\xc2\xa0 The Volcker rule, which met initial resistance and may have continued resistance on Wall Street, the President believed was enormously important as it related to the size of banks and the scope of what activities they can take part in.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think as they get through the process of appointing who\xe2\x80\x99s going to deal with these issues, we\'ll have a chance to go through and compare those provisions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Admiral Blair.\xc2\xa0 You said the President decided it was time to make a change.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of when he began to think that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was it Christmas Day or was it more recently?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the timing of it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why did he interview candidates before Director Blair gave his resignation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To have people ready to -- if he decided to make a change.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Senator Dodd says he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly sticking with AG Blumenthal as the -- to run for the seat that he\xe2\x80\x99s vacating at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Where does the White House stand on --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not heard anything that would -- from the political shop that would lead me to believe anything other than our continued support as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a candidate, President Obama said that he would like to see fuel economy standards doubled to 50 miles per gallon by 2027.\xc2\xa0 Is the President committed to that goal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see where -- what the progress we\'ve made and where we are on that goal as it relates to the improvements that have been made with cars and light trucks and with the additional announcements today of larger trucks and work vehicles.\xc2\xa0 Let me talk with Carol Browner and others to see sort of where we are on that goal.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the rat, mouse, mole, vole?\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten anything from the Park Service yet?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have some control mechanisms in place?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what it is?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- red-tail hawk to get --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this Burton\xe2\x80\x99s wheelhouse?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of varmint.\xc2\xa0 I would say -- Reggie and I were discussing this.\xc2\xa0 Based on the picture that -- the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t see this yesterday, so I was telling him about it today.\xc2\xa0 And Reggie says field mouse.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, uh-huh.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Way too big for a mouse.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said, based on the size of the photograph, comparing it to the diameter of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s Reggie\xe2\x80\x99s technical expertise?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My sense is that Reggie has lived in some houses with field mouses -- field mice. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I would say, again, judging the size of the animal, based on the diameter of the seal, I got to tell you, that\'s a rat.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Where I\'m from that\'s a rat and we should treat it as such.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A mole or vole?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s a vole.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of concern about the rat in the Rose Garden?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a mole?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A vole.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been online all day working on this.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s a vole?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, but they keep --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A vole is a rodent about that size.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a mole, it\xe2\x80\x99s a vole?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ask the Park Service to give us an answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have so many people in the Gulf working on this we could --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President want done about it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you using humane traps?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President want done about it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That he did not get into.\xc2\xa0 Look, my guess is that it lives out there somewhere in the Rose Garden quite comfortably.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s okay with that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99d be a pretty good Rose Garden to live in.\xc2\xa0 I still think -- it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not a mouse.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen a mouse and they\xe2\x80\x99re not nearly that big.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m now going to go Google \xe2\x80\x9cvole\xe2\x80\x9d and see if John Holdren is around.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:53 P.M.
