Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:49 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very good to have you here.\xc2\xa0 I hope you are as excited to be here as I am.\xc2\xa0 I mean that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s always an honor and a privilege.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll give a special dispensation to Bill.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have anything long at the top.\xc2\xa0 I would just note that the issue of the sequester continues to drive a lot of conversation here in Washington, understandably.\xc2\xa0 The potential implementation of the sequester is upon us.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President speak about it yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what is essential to understand is that the effect of the sequester would be severe and it would go right to American families -- middle-class Americans -- people who receive vital health services; there are people working today who will lose their jobs if the sequester goes into effect.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s wholly unnecessary that the sequester goes into effect because the option for Congress is to do what it did just a few months ago, which is come to an agreement on a reasonable package, a balanced package of spending cuts and revenue increases to buy the sequester down for enough time to allow Congress to do the important work of writing a budget that reduces our deficit further in a responsible way for the long term.</p>\n<p>Republicans thus far have refused to do this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to go along with the American public on the simple notion that balance is the right approach to dealing with this problem. And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that if they hold that position and the sequester goes into effect, it will go into effect and those Americans will lose their jobs because Republicans made a choice for that to happen.</p>\n<p>There was an interesting piece some of you may have seen -- well, first of all, the Wall Street Journal op/ed by the Speaker of the House yesterday and then a piece that I just saw not too long ago that begins:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIn a Wall Street Journal op/ed Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner describes the upcoming sequester as a policy that \xe2\x80\x98threatens U.S. national security, thousands of jobs, and more\xe2\x80\x99 -- continuing with the piece -- \xe2\x80\x9cwhich leads to the question, why would Republicans support a measure that threatens national security and thousands of jobs?\xc2\xa0 The effect of Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is to make President Obama seem reasonable.\xc2\xa0 After all, the President certainly agrees with Boehner that the sequester cuts threaten national security and jobs.\xc2\xa0 The difference is that Obama wants to avoid them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Couldn\'t have said it better.\xc2\xa0 That was Byron York.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it is essential that we avoid these cuts.\xc2\xa0 It is bad policy.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker himself says it is bad policy.\xc2\xa0 We -- the Congress, rather, must act to make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 To that point, the sequester would hit the government to $85 billion in the first year.\xc2\xa0 But CBO says that actually the hit this year would be half that.\xc2\xa0 Discretionary outlays would drop by $35 billion, mandatory by $9 billion; the rest would occur in later years.\xc2\xa0 And on Sunday, a Republican senator said, we\'re talking about 2.5 percent of what we spend this year and this is our first year of 10-year cuts.\xc2\xa0 Families all across the country have had their budgets cut by larger than that as a result of the economic downturn.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Is the lack of urgency to deal with this somewhat justified given those numbers?\xc2\xa0 I mean, even when we were dealing with the debt ceiling, or you were dealing with the fiscal cliff, there was a lot more activity going on out of this White House 10 days before than there is now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal of activity in this White House with regards to the sequester, and there will continue to be.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President and heard the President yesterday urge Congress to take the necessary action to avoid these across-the-board, indiscriminate cuts that -- quoting Speaker Boehner -- \xe2\x80\x9cwould do harm to our national security and cost jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are not jobs in the abstract.\xc2\xa0 These are men and women patrolling our borders.\xc2\xa0 These are teachers.\xc2\xa0 These are first responders.\xc2\xa0 These are real people whose futures hang in the balance, depending on a decision that Republicans in Congress will or will not make.</p>\n<p>Secondly, if you cite the CBO, the CBO estimates that the sequester, if it takes place in 2013, will reduce growth by .6 percentage points during 2013.\xc2\xa0 That is a significant hit.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen impacts from the sequester, as all of you wrote and analysts made clear back in January.\xc2\xa0 The fourth quarter GDP number for 2012 came in where it was in large part because of -- in the Defense Department in particular, and anticipation of the sequester drove down defense spending.\xc2\xa0 And we will see only more of that happen if this sequester kicks in.</p>\n<p>The CBO number on GDP growth, what would happen if the\xc2\xa0 sequester happened is mirrored by estimates by private sector firms.\xc2\xa0 Moody\xe2\x80\x99s Analytics says the reduction would be .5 percent. Macroeconomics Advisers, I think you saw today, is .6 percent.\xc2\xa0 CBO estimates that job losses resulting from the sequester could reach -- would reach, rather -- 750,000 by the fourth quarter of this year.\xc2\xa0 And the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that over two years the effect would be a million jobs.</p>\n<p>This is real.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- it is urgent.\xc2\xa0 And it is important that Congress act.\xc2\xa0 And the choice is clear.\xc2\xa0 The American people support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. Out in the country, Democrats, independents, and Republicans support a balanced approach to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And if you ask the American people if the choice is that those 70,000 kids get thrown off of Head Start, or those border security guards lose their jobs, or those teachers have their jobs threatened, on the one hand -- or we ask corporate jet owners to give up their special tax loophole, what do you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, overwhelmingly?\xc2\xa0 This is an indefensible position.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The choice that Republicans are making is preserve these special tax breaks for oil and gas companies, for corporate jet owners in order -- or -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- throw these people out of work in order to protect these special tax break for corporate jet owners and oil and gas companies.\xc2\xa0 It makes no sense and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when the Speaker says the discussion about revenue is closed, again, ask Americans around the country whether they agree that it is better economic policy for middle-class Americans to lose their jobs, or oil and gas companies to have their subsidies reduced or corporate jet owners to have their loophole closed.\xc2\xa0 I think we all know that the answer would be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If a House plan can\'t win in the Senate and a Senate plan can\xe2\x80\x99t win in the House, what is the White House doing to foster negotiations right now?\xc2\xa0 Is anybody talking?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we always make these -- we hear these declarative statements from Capitol Hill and also from the press about what can and cannot pass.\xc2\xa0 We heard them last year about how revenue would never be allowed.\xc2\xa0 We would never go along -- this is a Republican speaking -- we would never allow tax rates to go up.\xc2\xa0 We would never allow them to go up -- again, the next line of defense was, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never allow them to go up on anybody making less than a million dollars.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll never let the top rate go back to the Clinton-era top rate of 39.6.\xc2\xa0 All of those things happened.</p>\n<p>You know why they happened?\xc2\xa0 Because the American people supported those positions that the President took and in the end, Congress responded to the will of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen again this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there were talks going on right up until those decisions were made.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am entirely sure that we will continue to engage with Congress, including the leaders in Congress, on this issue at every level.\xc2\xa0 But the issue here isn\xe2\x80\x99t, as I said yesterday, sitting around the table or sitting in some chairs here in the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Congress and congressional leaders, congressional Republicans making a choice between allowing the sequester to kick in with all of the negative effects that would come from that, or postponing the sequester in a reasonable way with a balanced package of spending cuts and revenue increases.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President has inveighed against this process of lurching from crisis to crisis, and yet he\xe2\x80\x99s been in the forefront of describing the dire consequences that would result from the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t he contribute to the crisis atmosphere by being so outspoken about that?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be more productive for him to sit down with the other party and try to work this out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the fact is, as I think Jim just pointed out, the President has spent an enormous amount of time sitting down with congressional leaders to try to resolve these stalemates over our budget policy again and again and again.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to engage with Congress on these matters.\xc2\xa0 But it is nonsensical, in our view, to suggest that that is the only approach to take -- because would that it were so that simply persuasion from the President or anyone else sitting in a room about the right course to take would be enough to convince Republicans that it is better to ask corporate jet owners to forego their special interest loophole in the tax code than to throw all these people out of work.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s what were required, we would do just that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is congressional Republicans are going to listen to the American people, and that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to engage the American people and not just speak to members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 You have to do both, and we have always done both, and will continue to do both.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see the likelihood of sequester increasingly greater now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make predictions.\xc2\xa0 I would note that Congress is out this week, which says something, I suppose. But the fact of the matter is the March 1st deadline is looming, and Congress has an option -- a very simple option -- which is to take up the proposals put forward by Senate Democrats and House Democrats that would do what Congress did collectively -- Republicans and Democrats -- at the end of last year, first of this year, and that is delay the implementation of the sequester by buying it down through spending cuts and revenue increases so that Congress can then get on with regular order -- which goes to the other issue that you raised in your question, which is the need to stop this practice of engaging in manufactured crises.</p>\n<p>We need to return to a process that has Congress, the House and the Senate, working on budget proposals, the President submitting his budget, and compromise emerging from that process. And compromise in this case means deficit reduction through entitlement reforms, spending cuts, and tax reform that produces more revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s how we\'ve gotten to where we are, which is over $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction under this President, and it\'s how we will get to the goal of $4 trillion in further -- in total deficit reduction over 10 years if Congress does the right thing, avoids this unnecessary crisis and all of the negative effects that would come from it, passes a short-term buy-down of the sequester, and proceeds with regular order and the budgetary process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, the Japanese Prime Minister is due in town at the end of the week.\xc2\xa0 Japan is eager for U.S. natural gas exports, but U.S. manufacturers are worried that they could be adversely impacted.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration open to allowing more exports of natural gas to Japan?\xc2\xa0 What are some of the other topics the President hopes to raise with the Japanese Prime Minister?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, Mark, I appreciate the questions.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure we will have a preview for you of the meeting with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate from here with our very important allies, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\'m sure we\'ll have more to say about this tomorrow and certainly Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the President\'s plan to prevent the\xc2\xa0 sequestration from happening?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a plan --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday he talked about budget cuts.\xc2\xa0 What are those cuts that he is proposing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you can go to whitehouse.gov and look at the President\'s budget, look at his submission to the sequester and look at all the reporting -- ample reporting done and information that we provided on the offer that the President made to the Speaker of the House in December that in great detail put forward the spending cuts that the President supported and put forward, as well as the savings from entitlement reforms -- significant savings from entitlement reforms.</p>\n<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s to me a fundamental aspect of this -- like if we all agree that in Washington, Republicans, if they lived in a perfect world and there were nothing but Republicans in Washington and in the country, they would only cut spending and never raise revenue to reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats -- let\xe2\x80\x99s just say this were true-- Democrats would only raise revenue and never cut spending, especially not entitlement spending.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the test of leadership?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the test of making tough choices?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You might say it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans agreeing to go along with some revenue and Democrats agreeing to go along with some spending cuts and entitlement savings.\xc2\xa0 Well, what has happened? The President has led and put forward repeatedly proposals that are balanced, that include spending cuts -- tough spending cuts for Democrats to agree to -- that include savings from entitlement reforms -- very tough decisions for Democrats -- including we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a technical change in our CPI that is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of Democrats, but in the context of a bigger deal that includes revenue, reasonable revenue that asks the wealthiest and large corporations to pay their fair share, the President is willing to go along with it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What have seen from Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Not a single, similar kind of tough choice.\xc2\xa0 All we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is no revenue, no revenue, no revenue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d rather see those jobs lost.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d rather see the border less secure.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d rather see our national security undermined than corporate jet owners, God forbid, give up their tax break.\xc2\xa0 That is not a position that represents courage, leadership or common sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not have the President come out and say, here\xe2\x80\x99s my plan -- prevent this from happening?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems that what you\xe2\x80\x99re driving at is more revenue in the form of closing these loopholes and deductions.\xc2\xa0 You just went through the fiscal cliff process where you extracted these concessions from the Republicans in raising the rate.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a bit much to expect that kind of concession again just a couple of months later?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Thus far, there\xe2\x80\x99s been $2.5 trillion at least achieved in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been pretty, but under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, working with Congress, that has happened.\xc2\xa0 By a margin of more than 2 to 1, that deficit reduction has been achieved through spending cuts over revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re done with revenue suggests that the proposals that the Speaker of the House said he was willing to embrace last year that included up to $800 billion in revenue from tax reform are no longer worthwhile; that those loopholes that should be closed, well, that\'s not good policy anymore.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Why?\xc2\xa0 Why was it good policy back in December to eliminate special interest tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and large corporations, tax breaks, advantages in the tax code that regular folks don\'t get and small businesses don\'t get -- why was it good policy then in the name of deficit reduction but not now? Why is it better to preserve those tax breaks now than to preserve the jobs of average Americans around the country who would lose those jobs if the sequester goes into effect?</p>\n<p>And when you ask, where\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been there.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on whitehouse.gov.\xc2\xa0 It is in the proposal that he submitted to the Speaker of the House, that the Speaker walked away from, that everyone here represented as -- or most people here understood to be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s a budget plan for the long term.\xc2\xa0 Where --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s the big deal.\xc2\xa0 And the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is the plan to prevent sequestration from happening next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President supports --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President take the lead and present that plan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- well, first of all, Congress has to act.\xc2\xa0 If it were otherwise and the President could do this himself, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he would.\xc2\xa0 Congress has to pass the law to avoid sequestration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Senate Democrats have put a proposal on the table, House Democrats have put a proposal on the table that achieves the balance that we support.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s all we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is a small package to buy down the sequester to the end of the year so that Congress can then come together and achieve the big goal here, which is the further work that needs to be done to get to that $4 trillion figure that economists have said is what we need to get our fiscal house in order and our economy on a fiscally sustainable path for the coming decade.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President has been talking about.</p>\n<p>But I cannot emphasize enough how important it is when you talk about the comparisons here -- the President has consistently put forward proposals that include spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 He has consistently put forward proposals that include entitlement reforms, not just revenues.\xc2\xa0 What we have not seen from Republicans in any detail and in any sincere way -- certainly not in the legislative form -- is a proposal that is similar in its request of Republicans that they compromise and make some tough choices.</p>\n<p>The public wants that.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly wants it.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Given that -- most realistically, given the handful of days that are left, the best option is a short-term buy-down plan.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there any value of going over the sequester, letting it kick in, and actually working toward a long-term deficit reduction plan, instead of just kicking the can down the road one more time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I would say to that.\xc2\xa0 It may sound okay in the abstract, but it doesn\'t sound okay around the kitchen table in the homes of those families who would be affected by the job cuts, by the furloughs and the layoff notices that will come if the sequester kicks in.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t sound okay to the children who -- and the parents of the children who will have to give up mental health services, or to seniors who would lose services, or to those who, understandably, worry about our border being protected who would then see a reduction in the Border Patrol because the sequester goes into effect.</p>\n<p>The President firmly believes we ought to continue seeking and striving for completion of the so-called grand bargain or big deal, the $4 trillion figure.\xc2\xa0 Congress has demonstrated an interest in pursuing regular budget order, in pursuing a budgetary process that could lead to that end and achievement of that goal.\xc2\xa0 But it is wholly unnecessary to throw up to 750,000 people out of work just to get there.\xc2\xa0 They can pass an extension of the sequester, a delay of the sequester, just like they did at the end of last year so that Congress can get the work that it wants to get done, done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at what point does it get done if not now?\xc2\xa0 And at what point does the President and Congress really try to avert these manufactured crises the President talked about yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s legislature that has been submitted that would avert the sequester implementation by House and Senate Democrats.\xc2\xa0 The President supports that legislation.\xc2\xa0 It represents the balance that the American people overwhelmingly support.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of both cuts and revenue increases that have in the past been acceptable to both sides in the name of avoiding something as draconian as the sequester.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Congress should do, and the President would sign that, and then continue with the process -- the President will submit his budget; the Senate will come up with a budget and pass a budget; and then we can return to a process that, hopefully, if there is compromise, if there is a willingness -- going back to earlier questions -- by Republicans to make the same kinds of touch choices from their perspective that Democrats and the President have been willing to make, that we can then get this business done -- achieve the $4 trillion in total deficit reduction over a decade that has been the goal since this process started.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President reached out to key Republicans who were working on immigration reform yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Does this represent a shift in his strategy?\xc2\xa0 Can we expect him to reach out to Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner on the sequester today or in the coming days?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls or meetings to announce or preview for you today.\xc2\xa0 But I think it represents the regular engagement on the top priorities that the President has and that the country has with members of Congress, and that will continue.</p>\n<p>As I think we learned yesterday, yes, the President reached out to some of the Republican leaders of the Gang of Eight on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That is in keeping with the regular outreach that has been done at a staff level by the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans have said they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had regular engagement with the President and they say they haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from him in months on the sequester.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President is the President, and he has working for him here a substantial staff that engages and works with Congress on these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President has made clear, he is encouraged by and hopeful about the process underway in the Senate, the bipartisan process led by the so-called Gang of Eight, towards achieving a comprehensive immigration reform bill that could pass the Senate -- hopefully overwhelmingly -- and pass the House, and land on his desk for his signature.\xc2\xa0 He prefers that option to any other, and he is very encouraged by the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made thus far.\xc2\xa0 He thought his conversations with Senate Democrats involved in this process last week were very productive, and he felt the same about his conversations with Senate Republicans yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the sequester, you said repeatedly today and yesterday that these are real and urgent cuts that would take place quickly.\xc2\xa0 But The New York Times points out today that when the President was saying yesterday in his remarks that tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids, that that\xe2\x80\x99s not really going to happen on March 1st, is it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how do you back up that tens of thousands of parents will be searching for childcare immediately?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, whether these cuts -- whether that search begins on March 1st or in the near future, the impact on our economy, the impact on people\xe2\x80\x99s lives is real.\xc2\xa0 Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 Macroeconomics Advisers, Moody\'s, the CBO all estimate massive job loss if the sequester is allowed to take effect.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happens on March 1st?\xc2\xa0 What happens on March 2nd?\xc2\xa0 How quickly does this -- because when you say -- the President said that yesterday, too -- hundreds of thousands of jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\'s not going to be hundreds of thousands of job losses the first week, are there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but there will be job losses, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been clear.\xc2\xa0 Look, we have already --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But people want to quantify this because you\'re making -- you\'re scaring the public that this is going to happen, it\'s going to be horrible --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So these outside economic firms are scaring the public?\xc2\xa0 And the CBO is scaring the public?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying, how do you back up that this is urgent and that hundreds of thousands of jobs are going to be lost?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'d love to rewind to the questions I got the day that the GDP figure came out for the fourth quarter.\xc2\xa0 And those questions were pretty alarming.\xc2\xa0 And maybe you guys were trying to scare the public, but, in fact, I think you guys were asking sensible questions about why we got the number we got.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons we got the number we got in the fourth quarter, despite all the other positive economic news we had been getting, was because industries, especially in the defense sector, were anticipating the implementation of the sequester, which, at the time, of course, was due January 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But Congress did the sensible thing -- something it could do again -- which is passed an extension, a delay of the sequester, by buying it down with a reasonable, balanced package of spending cuts and revenues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they ought to do again.</p>\n<p>It is easy to stand in Washington, whether you\'re a congressman on Capitol Hill, or a reporter here, or an administration official, and suggest that this is all abstract.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not abstract to the people who are affected.\xc2\xa0 And there will be people affected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think we heard today that there\'s a process -- the process begins, essentially, at the Defense Department for furlough notices, the process that leads to furlough notices.\xc2\xa0 Those are people who are working to protect our country every day who will be affected by the implementation of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Those are real people with real jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the election, though, the White House tried to stop those furlough notices -- right before the election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were hopeful -- well, first of all, before the election -- the election was, what, November 6th, November 8th?\xc2\xa0 That was not 10 days before implementation of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one.</p>\n<p>Two, the fact is we\'re doing reasonable planning -- the administration has reasonable planning in anticipation of a sequester that, again, depending on the day of the week, the Speaker of the House either says is a good thing that he\'s convinced his fellow Republicans in the House to support because he\'s got it in his back pocket as leverage against the President and Democrats, or is a bad thing because the cuts would hurt our national defense and cost us jobs.\xc2\xa0 Both can\'t be true unless you\'re highly cynical.\xc2\xa0 And we agree that the sequester implementation would be a bad thing for jobs, for middle-class families, and for our national defense.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the general wisdom in Washington is that it\'s probably going to happen --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How often is it right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we suspect that you\'re willing to take a few weeks of this until it begins to bite and you have to then get some more money, the CR runs out end of the month -- I mean, work it all together to your advantage?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you should pay attention to what we have been doing and saying.\xc2\xa0 And in contrast to, unfortunately, Republicans, including the leadership, including the Speaker of the House, who have been suggesting that implementation of the sequester would not be a bad thing, that it would give them political leverage --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I hear what you\'re saying --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- but we have been I think -- the question I just got a moment ago was that we\'re being too alarmist about the implementation of the sequester.</p>\n<p>Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want the sequester to happen.\xc2\xa0 The impact would be negative on our economy, would be terrible for American families.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xc2\xa0 We think that it\'s bad policy.\xc2\xa0 It was designed to be bad policy.\xc2\xa0 That was the whole point.\xc2\xa0 The sequester was written in a way that would assure that Congress would never let it happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by putting it off to the point where it was put off, it conflates to your advantage, perhaps.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'re not -- I think you\'re misunderstanding.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we\'re not doing a good enough job of trying to convince you that we wholly support efforts in Congress to buy down the sequester.\xc2\xa0 They should come back and do it tomorrow, and if not, come back and do it next week -- buy it down so that the sequester does not have an effect -- an immediate effect, and that Congress can get back to work on long-term deficit reduction so we can get that $4 trillion deficit reduction that economists have long called for and that we have been working towards, the President and the Congress, not always in pretty fashion.</p>\n<p>But the fact is, $2.5 trillion -- up to $2.7 in deficit reduction has been achieved thus far.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a situation where our deficits are coming down, but we need to do more work to make sure that process continues.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President wants.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a question about the USTR announcement this afternoon about cybercrime, among other things; trade protection?\xc2\xa0 What can we expect?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you\'re talking about the issue of trade secrets --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are two things that I think have been conflated, and I want to make sure that everybody understands.\xc2\xa0 There were a series of stories in the last 48 hours or so about hackers, cybersecurity issues, and I addressed that in the briefing yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is a very large concern of the President\'s.\xc2\xa0 He\'s made this an issue repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 He pressed Congress last year to pass legislation, and as you know, just the other day issued an executive order addressing cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is an executive order is not a substitute for new cyber legislation.\xc2\xa0 So we, again, call on Congress to take up cybersecurity legislation because it\'s important for our national security and our economic security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other issue, which I think you\'re talking about, is that today there is a launch of the administration\'s strategy to -- I almost said \xe2\x80\x9cstrategery,\xe2\x80\x9d which would be pretty funny -- (laughter) -- to mitigate the theft of U.S. trade secrets.\xc2\xa0 We know that trade secret theft can cripple a company\'s competitive advantage in foreign markets, diminish export prospects around the globe, and put American jobs in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 And that strategy we are releasing today coordinates and improves U.S. government efforts to protect the innovation that drives the American economy and supports jobs in the United States.</p>\n<p>So these are understandably related issues, but separate.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said repeatedly this is a choice between tax breaks for corporate jet owners and devastating spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me how much money closing that loophole for corporate jet owners would save?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that figure.\xc2\xa0 I know -- I remember from when we talked about this and called on Congress to do it that we\'re talking in terms of subsidies to oil and gas companies something like $4 billion a year, if I remember.\xc2\xa0 We can get those figures for you.</p>\n<p>Here\'s the thing.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s the point I\'m making, Jon, is the President has never said, we have never said that we should close our deficit through revenue increases alone.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President has always said that we should have a ratio of spending cuts that is -- ratio of spending cuts to revenues that is higher in spending cuts than revenues.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\'s pursued.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have to do it in a balanced way, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you end up with something like the Ryan budget, which, in the name of deficit reduction and also tax breaks for the wealthy, voucherized Medicare.\xc2\xa0 Well, that was bad policy and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can we acknowledge here that closing the tax loophole for corporate jet owners -- which, as far as I know, I think is about $300 million a year or a little less -- that that is not going to solve your sequester problem?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you keep pointing to it as --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We can acknowledge it, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tiny sliver, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- implicit in your suggestion is that we\'ve ever suggested it would.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'ve said multiple times today that they want to project -- they want to protect corporate jet owners\' loophole instead of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me a single tax loophole, special-interest tax breaks that Republicans have identified that they are willing to close to reduce the deficit?\xc2\xa0 I take your silence as no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll let them make their case for that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take more than corporate --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Although the Speaker of the House did -- the Speaker of the House -- let\'s give him a little credit here -- did, late last year, suggest without giving any details, that he could come up with $800 billion in revenue from wealthy Americans and corporations to reduce the deficit by closing loopholes and capping deductions.\xc2\xa0 We think he\'s right, or he was right then.\xc2\xa0 We can do that.</p>\n<p>It\'s not going to do the job alone -- absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has signed into law more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction, 2-to-1 spending cuts over revenue increases.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he continues to have on the table an offer to the Republicans, an offer to the Speaker of the House, that includes spending cuts, including savings from revenue -- I mean, savings from entitlement programs that are very tough for Democrats to accept.\xc2\xa0 But as part of a balanced package, he has put it forward and the offer still stands.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on a totally different subject, why does the Vice President keep suggesting that people buy shotguns?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The point the Vice President was making yesterday is one that he\xe2\x80\x99s made before.\xc2\xa0 And that is, first, that this administration, this President and this Vice President, this administration firmly supports our Second Amendment rights upheld by the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the right of homeowners, law-abiding American citizens to have a firearm at their home to protect themselves and their home.</p>\n<p>The point he was making yesterday -- again, a point that he\'s made in the past -- is that in his view, you do not need a military-style assault weapon to protect your home.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you would be better off with a shotgun, including --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Double-barrel.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I think that is what he said.\xc2\xa0 And as I understand it, he has a double-barrel -- he has a 12-gauge and a 20-gauge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President agree with him -- and this is a direct quote from the Vice President -- "If you want to protect yourself, get a double-barreled shotgun."\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President -- the President does agree with the Vice President that homeowners who are interested in utilizing their Second Amendment rights to own a firearm to protect themselves in their home, and their families in their home, do not need a military-style assault weapon, and that a shotgun would be a logical choice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going out onto the balcony and firing a couple shots in the air, is that -- I mean, that was the other thing he suggested.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that was what the Vice President recommended.\xc2\xa0 I think the point he was making is that you do not need a military-style assault weapon, and that a shotgun would do the trick.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the theft of trade secrets report coming out later this afternoon -- how much of that is aimed at China?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we need to separate reports yesterday about hacking -- and I addressed this yesterday and I think I made clear that with regard to China, the United States and China are among the world\'s largest cyber actors, and it is vital that we continue a sustained, meaningful dialogue and work together to develop an understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>We repeatedly and will continue to raise our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military.\xc2\xa0 And that is that issue.</p>\n<p>On trade secrets, again, I would refer you to the rollout later today that the OMB\'s Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator will be releasing as part of the administration\'s strategy to mitigate the theft of U.S. trade secrets.\xc2\xa0 So more details on that will be forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration favor fines or trade retaliation for countries that are engaged in this sort of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a broad question that would have to be addressed by the experts on this issue, so I would refer you to the rollout later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, one other.\xc2\xa0 Any number of companies, and according to court cases, GM, DuPont, others have been victims of such espionage.\xc2\xa0 What does the administration want companies to do as a result of this report coming out this afternoon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, with regards to the trade secrets report, I would urge you to seek information from those who are rolling out the strategy.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that as a general matter, this administration has been focused on protecting government cybersecurity as well as assisting and providing information to the private sector to help the private sector protect itself when it comes to cybercrime.</p>\n<p>This is especially important when it comes to private companies that deal with the national infrastructure -- the electric grid and other types of infrastructure that is vital in this country.\xc2\xa0 So this is a very serious issue.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard John Brennan and others address it in the past.\xc2\xa0 It is something that is very much on the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xc2\xa0 It is why the President has urged Congress to act appropriately on cybersecurity legislation and why, again, today we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on Congress to act.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to a question I asked you yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We know CBO has the numbers for those -- the job losses through sequestration.\xc2\xa0 What are the White House numbers? Have you, the numbers crunchers here, calculated the exact numbers that you think if sequestration were to happen, how many people would lose their jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific numbers done by White House economists.\xc2\xa0 I think you can assume that my citation of CBO, Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, and Macroeconomics Advisers to outside private economic firms suggests that we believe that they are in the ballpark of accuracy over here when we talk about massive job loss that would result from implementation of the sequester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when the President said hundreds of thousands yesterday, he was talking about Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, he was talking about -- or was he talking about CBO?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We agree with the consensus estimates here, again, from private outside economic firms, from the Congressional Budget Office that say that we would lose -- the country would lose up to 750,000 jobs if the sequester were allowed to be implemented.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to kind of follow up -- back up on what Jon said.\xc2\xa0 It was kind of striking what the Vice President said yesterday about the double-barreled shotgun.\xc2\xa0 How long has he been an owner of a shotgun?\xc2\xa0 And what does he -- is he a hunter? Is it just for protection?\xc2\xa0 What?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 This is a comment he has made on several occasions, and I would refer you to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 He does own and keeps in a safe at his home in Delaware a .12-gauge and a .20-gauge shotgun.\xc2\xa0 He is a law-abiding gun owner.\xc2\xa0 And I think that reflects the fact that he, as Vice President and as a senator, and this President fully supports Second Amendment rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A point that I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make again and again when we talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive package of proposals to address the problem of gun violence in America would not -- if all of them were implemented, the executive actions and the legislation -- if it all happened tomorrow, not a single law-abiding American citizen would lose his or her weapon, or his or her firearm.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because we believe in Second Amendment rights.\xc2\xa0 But we need to take action -- sensible action, common-sense action to try to reduce the scourge of gun violence in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to follow up on that real quick.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he did bring the Second Lady into the conversation with that, and he was talking about -- he said, you know, Jill, if -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m just paraphrasing -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem, just fire it off twice.\xc2\xa0 So is she -- do you have any information on her?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office.</p>\n<p>Donovan.\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry, and then Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any estimate about White House jobs that may be lost or furloughed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question and refer you to OMB.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you can get back to us on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really get back to us.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to -- no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would he cancel his trip to the Middle East if the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you have to plan.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate.\xc2\xa0 We believe Congress should act next week to avoid the sequester.\xc2\xa0 It is inherently the right thing to do, using -- if you just look at what the Speaker of the House himself has said all on different occasions about the terrible consequences of the sequester to our national defense and to jobs, it makes the point -- he makes the point, as the President has made and others have made, that Congress should take the appropriate action to avoid the sequester so that Congress can then proceed to deal with our larger budget challenges.</p>\n<p>Donovan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t rule out canceling the trip?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, if you could get back to me --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no schedule changes to make or announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you could get back to me about the White House job numbers and planning process, that would be great.\xc2\xa0 Separately, North Korea has released --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I could also encourage you to call OMB, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll do both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 North Korea has released a video showing the President surrounded by flames and is suggesting -- the official state news agency said that it was a computer visualization of their nuclear attack -- their threatened nuclear attack, and it\xe2\x80\x99s directed obviously at the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering if you guys had seen that, and if you had a reaction.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I read about it.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that provocative propaganda is far less concerning to us and to our allies than provocative actions that violate North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s commitments to the United Nations and the international community, its flagrant violations of its commitments when it comes to its nuclear weapons program.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with our allies to isolate and pressure North Korea appropriately, given its continuing defiance of its international obligations.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the issue of immigration again, Senator John McCain, in his home state at a town meeting today, said that obviously the borders are not secure, that Arizona remains the main drug pipeline for drugs coming from Mexico, and that until this issue is resolved there will be no path to citizenship.<br/>\n\tUnderstanding the numbers there that have happened recently, still how would the White House certify -- how would the White House propose to convince those along the borders that what they\'re saying is not true, that the borders are secure?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have made the point very clearly that\'s backed up by independent data that our borders are significantly more secure than when the President took office; that we have made great strides in border security in the last several years; that we have dedicated significant resources to that effort and that statistics bear out the fact that that effort is resulting in fewer -- producing positive results in terms of migration and interdictions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have never said that the work is done, that the job is done.\xc2\xa0 That is why when the President talks about comprehensive immigration reform, when the President lays out his blueprint -- as he has now for more than a year on whitehouse.gov -- one of the priorities -- the number-one priority is continuing to take necessary action to enhance our border security, following on the work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done thus far.</p>\n<p>I would point to previous quotes, very recent quotes from Senator McCain in which he acknowledged the significant improvements in border security that have been made over the last several years.\xc2\xa0 And we share his commitment to taking further action as part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s a lot of disagreement here when it comes to the need to pursue enhanced border security as part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of why it\'s called comprehensive.</p>\n<p>So we look forward, as the President -- as we said in the aftermath of the President\'s conversations with Republican senators, to continuing to work with Congress, work with the Senate as they pursue bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 The President is encouraged by the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made.\xc2\xa0 We saw comments from Senator Rubio and others that talked about the positive progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made and the optimism that I think those engaged in the process generally share about the prospects of success.</p>\n<p>But we encourage the Senate to keep working because this is a significant priority.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a priority that has in the past enjoyed broad bipartisan support, and that we believe is, once again, enjoying broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that the legislation that then-Senator Obama supported back in 2006 was co-authored by Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 It had the support of President George W. Bush, Republican President.\xc2\xa0 And that I think represents and reflects what should be the bipartisan consensus behind this very important policy goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they are saying -- if John McCain is saying that the path to citizenship will not happen until the borders are secure, and there still remains this disagreement about whether or not they are secure, what is the White House\'s idea to certify?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be a commission?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be some kind of statement?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a certain number?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the specific comments that you\'ve talked about.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked a lot about the interplay between border security as part of a broader -- and other measures that are part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We wait to see what the bipartisan group produces and the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s written and produced by this effort.</p>\n<p>We insist -- and this reflects views of both Republicans and Democrats -- that comprehensive immigration reform provide a clear path to citizenship that includes getting in the back of the line and paying taxes and the like.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a goal, again, shared by Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge legislation that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen yet.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said that Republicans will ultimately be swayed by the American public.\xc2\xa0 I was looking at a bunch of polling results from the last few months that showed that Americans are pretty complacent about defense cuts in particular. They see more room for cutting the Pentagon budget.\xc2\xa0 Does that make it harder to sway Republicans on that part of the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to what Republicans have said about the effects of sequester -- sequestration on national security, on our defense readiness.\xc2\xa0 It is a fact that it affects deployment.\xc2\xa0 It would have impacts on Army readiness. It would impose cuts to Air Force flying hours.\xc2\xa0 And I think that would be a concern to all Americans who worry about our national defense.</p>\n<p>But it would also, again, result in 70,000 kids getting kicked off of Head Start.\xc2\xa0 It would result in cuts to mental health services for children, and to schools and teachers, to the border patrols I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, and to military mental health care -- to just name a few; to the jobs of first responders, to others who would be affected by this.</p>\n<p>So this is -- the reason why the list is so long is because the sequester was written to be broad and indiscriminate, and therefore not to become policy.\xc2\xa0 So we call on Congress to take reasonable and appropriate action to pass legislation that would buy down the sequester; postpone the sequester with a package of spending cuts and revenue increases that make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not asking people to lose their jobs rather than ask corporate jet owners to give up their tax breaks, or oil and gas companies to give up their taxpayer subsidies achieved through special lines in the tax code that reflect the influence they have in Washington through lobbyists that regular folks don\xe2\x80\x99t have, that small business owners don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this choice is so stark.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to have balance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And to go to Jon\xe2\x80\x99s point, we have never suggested that revenues alone would do the job.\xc2\xa0 We have always suggested that balance is the right approach; that spending cuts, entitlement reforms, and revenues taken together produce the kind of package -- as every bipartisan group that\xe2\x80\x99s looked at this has said -- that does the job that\xe2\x80\x99s fair -- in a fair way, and does it in a way that helps our economy grow and create jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The political calculation, though -- it was that the Pentagon cuts would be toxic to Republicans, not the Head Start cuts or something like that.\xc2\xa0 Are you surprised that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t seem as put off by that kind of cut?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m suffering from whiplash, because what Republicans said about how these cuts would be devastating and unacceptable last year they then seemed to recant earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 But then we have the Speaker saying again today that the cuts would be devastating and deep, and would result in job loss.\xc2\xa0 And for some reason, rather than focusing on solutions to this problem, they seem to be obsessed with whose idea it was in the first place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, I mean, you know my point about that, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s irrelevant, first of all, because the policy was never supposed to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 That was the purpose that both Democrats and Republicans had in mind when they wrote the legislation, A.\xc2\xa0 And then, B, if they had nothing to do with it and never liked it in the first place, why, as a Republican congressman has said, did they vote for it, overwhelmingly?\xc2\xa0 One hundred and seventy-one Republicans in the House voted for it, compared to I think 95 Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Every Republican leader in the House voted for it, including Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 And on the day it passed, the Speaker of the House said, I got 98 percent of what I wanted and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty pleased.</p>\n<p>So this is a ridiculous argument.\xc2\xa0 We should be focusing on solutions.\xc2\xa0 We should be focusing on resolving this so that people don\xe2\x80\x99t lose their jobs.</p>\n<p>Alexis -- last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just related to this -- can you clarify, is the President calling on the Senate next week to vote on the alternative to the sequester, the postponement, the mini deal that they pull together as time is ticking by?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure, when you were saying vote on the alternative, is a date set?\xc2\xa0 Does he want them to vote next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We want Congress to act before March 1st to avert the sequester.\xc2\xa0 There is legislation that has been put forward by Senate Democrats and House Democrats that would do that in a balanced way, a way that the President supports.\xc2\xa0 He would certainly welcome a congressional package of that legislation to achieve the goal he set out, which is to avoid the sequester so that Congress, working with the administration, can take action to further reduce our deficit in a way that helps our economy grow, that helps expand the middle class and create ladders of opportunity for Americans who aspire to the middle class.</p>\n<p>I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the simple formula here.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that difficult.\xc2\xa0 We should not have these kind of crises where some folks seem to see it as leverage and political advantage to drive our economy off a cliff, whichever cliff you choose, in this case the so-called sequester, in order to try to advance ideological goals.\xc2\xa0 We should be working towards common-sense solutions here.</p>\n<p>And common sense means balance.\xc2\xa0 It means tough choices by Democrats, tough choices by Republicans, nobody gets everything that they want, and we get something done for the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick budget question.\xc2\xa0 Somewhere between March 1 and March 27th, the President\'s next fiscal blueprint, his budget blueprint will come out, presumably before he goes to the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, how does the President want that new budget -- including his revenue ideas, his list of cuts, his list of investments -- how does he want that to shape the discussion that will either come after sequester or precede the CR debate?\xc2\xa0 How will that help or hurt the debate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the debate.\xc2\xa0 Our expectation -- well, I mean, I would say first off, I\'m sure the President will be enormously pleased if Congress just passed it as written.\xc2\xa0 That I don\xe2\x80\x99t think has ever happened, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it will.</p>\n<p>But a presidential budget is essentially a detailed outline for Congress of what the President\'s priorities are.\xc2\xa0 And we would certainly hope that, as has been the case in the past, that the balance represented in his approach to deficit reduction, the key investments that he insists we make in infrastructure, in education, in research and development are adopted by Congress, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we can ensure not only that people are working now and that the middle class is growing now, but that the American economy is strong in the future and that we do that, we put into place these policies in a way that reduces our deficit, gets our fiscal house in order and allows us to continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Dan, I feel like I\'ve been -- neglected you.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to Israel.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot of concern there about impact from the sequester on the Iron Dome project, maybe visiting an Iron Dome battery.\xc2\xa0 Can he go there with the intent on assuring Israelis that there will be no severe impact on support of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the specificity required to address the question about those kinds of impacts.\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon would be the place to go for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I can say broadly that the President believes, and agrees with the Speaker of the House, that the sequester should not become fact.\xc2\xa0 It was never meant to become implemented policy because, in part, the cuts to our defense are too severe and would adversely affect our national security.\xc2\xa0 But the specifics would have to be addressed over at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you take a question from a local affiliate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.\xc2\xa0 We want to hear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\'ll take a question.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see you guys here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the tax-exempt status of the corporate jets -- there are tens of thousands of people who are middle-class workers who work in corporate aviation.\xc2\xa0 My question is -- including several tens of thousands in Kansas, Washington, Oklahoma.\xc2\xa0 They are very worried about the President\'s comments about eliminating the tax exemption because in their words, every time it\'s been eliminated before, there has been layoffs.\xc2\xa0 And there have been thousands of layoffs in Kansas since the President started mentioning this in the corporate aviation area. These are middle-class workers.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that making budgets and choices about deficit reduction always involves difficult choices, and that when it\'s a choice between laying teachers off or affecting our national security or, in the broader scheme, reforming our tax code in a way that eliminates these tax breaks -- special interest tax breaks or subsidies, that is a better option than voucherizing Medicare or cutting education investment or throwing people -- kids off of Head Start.\xc2\xa0 I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The guy that lost his job last week -- or last June --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he left me a message and said, I lost my job because of this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure -- I mean, he supports a family.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the question here is what choices do we make, and do we choose to protect narrow, special interest loopholes that, by the way, the Speaker of the House said just late last year, there were so many of them that he could come up with $800 billion in revenues that he would direct towards deficit reduction just by closing loopholes like that and capping deductions like the ones we\'ve discussed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that there are benefits that are enjoyed by companies and others that flow from these loopholes and special provisions in the tax code.\xc2\xa0 But the broader interest here is in making choices that are fair for everyone in the way that we reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 And closing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the middle class is employed, so it will affect them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I take your point.\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve answered the question, which is that we have to make choices here.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, overwhelmingly, a decision to close a special interest tax break as opposed to throwing 70,000 kids off of Head Start is a pretty clear choice.\xc2\xa0 None of these are cost-free, but it\'s a pretty clear choice.</p>\n<p>Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:45 P.M.
