EST\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, the President and First Lady are headed to Coral Reef High School to talk about ensuring that as many students as possible fill out the financial aid forms that open the door to a college education.\xc2\xa0 Never before has a college education been as important as it is now in expanding opportunity and ensuring economic stability in this global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The First Lady has previously talked about efforts the administration has taken to simplify the financial aid form.\xc2\xa0 Today, the President will talk about an executive action that he\'ll take to better track which students have completed the form, which will assist efforts to encourage the families of students to do so.</p>\n<p>And I\'ll also point out that any time you\'re going to a school whose mascot is the barracuda you know it\'s going to be an interesting afternoon.\xc2\xa0 So it should be kind of fun.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, why don\'t we take some questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question -- the readout this morning on the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to the Japanese Prime Minister, he talked about they agreed to work with other G7 countries to put pressure on Russia.\xc2\xa0 Does that reference signal the U.S. no longer views the group as the G8?\xc2\xa0 And if that\'s the case, what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest on the President going to the previously scheduled so-called G8 summit in Sochi?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, as you know, what we have done is we\'ve suspended our participation in meetings to prepare for the G8 meeting in Sochi.\xc2\xa0 The reference to the G7 is simply an indication of how united those seven countries are in our resolve to stand up for principles relating to territorial integrity and individual state sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard these seven countries speak with one voice on this issue and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these seven countries demonstrate their resolve in considering a range of options to demonstrate that there will be costs associated with violating principles like this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So you saw the readout from the call that the President had with Prime Minister Abe, and Prime Minister Abe was of one mind with the President and the other members of the international community and the other members of the G7 on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Sochi, on or off?\xc2\xa0 If it continues, will the President go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any announcements to make about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel in June.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that there had been meetings, as there always is, in advance of the big meeting in June among the countries to prepare for meetings like that.\xc2\xa0 Our participation in those meetings has been suspended, and I think it would be logical for anybody to conclude that it raises significant questions about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99d participate in the meeting in June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about Senator Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s sexual assault bill -- military sexual assault bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember the President ever coming out and saying where he stood on that bill.\xc2\xa0 Did he have a position on it?\xc2\xa0 And was it getting blocked in the Senate, was that something that the White House thought was okay or --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to have to pull some additional information for you, which I could get this afternoon, related to this.\xc2\xa0 It has been the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak very forcefully as the Commander-in-Chief about taking the kinds of steps necessary to address what is a persistent problem in our armed forces.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of our position on specific proposals to reform that system, let me get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick one on Ukraine again.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have been pushing this plan to increase exports of natural gas.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration see that as some type of realistic option when it comes to helping overseas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me start by saying this:\xc2\xa0 There are six licenses that have been approved by the Department of Energy related to the export of about 8.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to a range of countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s important for you to understand about those licenses that have already been issued is that the projects for delivering the product would not be completed until the end of next year.\xc2\xa0 So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect.</p>\n<p>The other factor that\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand about the situation is the current inventories of liquefied natural gas in Europe and in Ukraine are actually above traditional levels or above normal levels.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is, unlike North America, they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a relatively mild winter in Europe and the region.\xc2\xa0 So there is no indication currently that there\xe2\x80\x99s much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region.</p>\n<p>The other dynamic that factors into all this is that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to countries around the world -- I would say natural gas and other sources of energy to countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 Shutting off the natural gas would threaten that reputation -- it certainly would undermine it, not just in the eyes of Ukraine and Europe but in countries around the world.</p>\n<p>Finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to recognize that Russia relies on revenue from exporting natural gas and other sources of energy.\xc2\xa0 Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a complicated situation.\xc2\xa0 For a more detailed explanation of this complicated dynamic, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Energy.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the top lines, the United States has a long relationship with Ukraine and has actually been talking about these energy issues for some time.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden traveled to Ukraine in 2009, and one of the items at the top of the agenda was efforts by the United States to work with Ukraine to help them reduce their dependence on Russian sources of energy, to help them reform their energy sector, to improve efficiency, to improve energy security in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So this is a complicated issue, one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been coordinating with the Ukrainians on for quite some time.</p>\n<p>So I think that mostly answers your question, but for a more detailed answer, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just related to that, did this come up in the call last night with the Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 Because I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s been really important for Japan to build a strong relationship with Russia for natural gas.\xc2\xa0 Was the President able to give any assurances to the Prime Minister about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a more detailed readout beyond what we issued last night and early this morning. But I will say that the executive order that the President issued yesterday put in place a structure where sanctions could be implemented.\xc2\xa0 As Jay discussed during the briefing, no specific organizations have been targeted at this point, but that process is underway.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no immediate impact from the sanctions that the President has considered in terms of interrupting anybody\xe2\x80\x99s access to Russian sources of energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What sanctions we\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on are individuals and entities that have interfered with or played a prominent role in interfering with the sovereignty of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And those are the individuals and entities that will be targeted.\xc2\xa0 And when we have additional announcements on that, we will.\xc2\xa0 Let me just end this answer by saying that, as I mentioned in my previous answer, that Prime Minister Abe is committed, or voiced to the President his commitment to closely coordinating with the international community and with the other countries in the G7 in standing up for the principle of respecting state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of independent nations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why the White House made the decision or the President made the decision to stick to the plan of spending the weekend in Key Largo, given obviously the pace of events overseas and the fact that the Vice President is also going to be out of the country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering the President this week, you know that he has had a very robust schedule of consulting with President Putin a couple of times this week, that he has had a number of conversations with Prime Minister Cameron, Chancellor Merkel, and other foreign leaders -- Prime Minister Abe just last night.\xc2\xa0 He has been able to do all of that without interrupting what has otherwise been a pretty busy schedule for him this week -- during a snow day in Washington, D.C., during the rollout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Fiscal Year 2015 budget.\xc2\xa0 Our ongoing efforts to monitor ongoing events in Ukraine and to stay in close contact with world leaders has not affected the other aspects of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s true of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule today.\xc2\xa0 The President and First Lady, as I mentioned at the top, are traveling to a high school to talk about this core component of the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic agenda.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, the President has been able to get updates from his national security team and I would anticipate that later today, the President will have at least one phone call to make with a world leader around the globe.\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get you a readout of that call, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>I think the point is that the President over the course of a very busy week has maintained his schedule and his ability to monitor ongoing events in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same thing this weekend.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is what the President is doing this weekend in Florida is essentially what the President will be doing if he stayed back at the White House.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just that the weather will be a little warmer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what else will he be doing besides monitoring world events?\xc2\xa0 What else will he be planning to do on his vacation, if you can give us a little flavor?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to spending some time with his wife and daughters, who are traveling down to Florida as well.\xc2\xa0 There are some recreational amenities on the property, including workout facilities, tennis courts, a couple of golf courses, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is a -- many of the people that the people that the President has been talking to in terms of our allies in Europe and other world leaders -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a six-hour time difference between here and there.\xc2\xa0 So if there is an opportunity for the President to enjoy some of those amenities, then he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0 What he will do and what he is looking forward to doing is getting a little bit of downtime in the warm weather with his wife and daughters.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you was any of the President\xe2\x80\x99s or the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s personal acquaintances or friends traveling on Air Force One who are not administration officials, do you know?\xc2\xa0 We saw someone boarding who happened to be well dressed with like a cowboy hat -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure who that was -- earlier before the President got there.\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if any other friends or acquaintances --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are a couple members of the Florida congressional delegation onboard.\xc2\xa0 I saw Congresswoman Frederica Wilson and Congressman Joe Garcia is on board as well.\xc2\xa0 It may have been one of the two of them that you saw.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know if any other, like, friends?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any other friends of the President or the First Lady that\xe2\x80\x99s on board.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there still a chance that he could go back to the White House tonight?\xc2\xa0 Or is the weekend here set pretty much?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance that the schedule could change, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any changes at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one more question on this.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got the Vice President out of town, the Secretary of State is still out of town, the National Security Advisor is in the Persian Gulf, and the President is heading to Florida.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering that\xe2\x80\x99s four senior national security officials not in Washington, including the President.\xc2\xa0 Is that an unusual set of circumstances?\xc2\xa0 And does that pose any issues in terms of how the government would respond should something sudden happen in Ukraine or Crimea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to speak to the travel habits of all of those officials.\xc2\xa0 Most of the people you described have as a part of their job description traveling overseas to represent the interest of the United States overseas.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if this is a fairly regular occurrence.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon when the President is traveling overseas for the National Security Advisor or for the Secretary of State to be with him.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon.</p>\n<p>I will say this:\xc2\xa0 The President is traveling this weekend with his Deputy National Security Advisor, Tony Blinken, who has played a very important role in handling this situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The President is traveling with the regular assortment of communications tools that will allow him to convene in a secure fashion meetings with his national security team, if necessary.\xc2\xa0 He, of course, has a telephone, so if he needs to make calls to world leaders, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s President Putin or our allies, or other international leaders that are involved in this effort, he can stay in regular touch with them.\xc2\xa0 So we have complete confidence that the President can handle all the responsibilities that he has, based on the resources that we have with us on the flight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That said, you were quoted earlier this week I think by Politico saying that it was still up in the air, there was some debate or some internal deliberations about whether he would maintain a weekend schedule of staying down there.\xc2\xa0 The decision seems that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to.\xc2\xa0 What was the debate about then if he can do that, and you know that?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the situation in the Ukraine is sort of calm enough that you can go reliably?\xc2\xa0 In other words, what was the debate or why did it come down on this side?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it as a debate.\xc2\xa0 I was quoted in Politico talking about the fact that the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule would be a little more fluid than usual because international events were a little more fluid than usual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I do think that what we have seen over the course of the last several days is the President has marshalled our allies to put in place a structure for responding to the situation that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the ground in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The President has had, again, multiple conversations with President Putin where he highlighted that there is an off-ramp here, that there is an opportunity for the Russians to sit down with the Ukrainians, facilitated by the international community, if necessary, to try to broker an agreement, to allow international inspectors into every corner of the nation of Ukraine to ensure that the rights of everybody, including the rights of ethnic Russians, are being protected.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve described before that that is a legitimate interest of Russia and, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate interest of the international community to ensure that the rights of all the citizens of Ukraine are being respected.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the Russians to live up to their basing agreement in Crimea, to return their soldiers and their troops to their bases, and for the international community to come together in support of the elections that are planned for May.\xc2\xa0 So there is a path to deescalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 And that is a path that has been set up by -- under the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0 We have marshalled the international community behind -- or in support of this potential off-ramp.\xc2\xa0 And I think over the course of the next few days, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a better indication about whether or not the Russians are open to that off-ramp.</p>\n<p>And one of the conclusions of the call that the President had with President Putin yesterday was that Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, should be in touch to talk about steps forward on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think -- the President is hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a little greater clarity on the situation over the course of the next few days.\xc2\xa0 And if additional steps need to be taken next week, then we can take those steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you characterize the tone of these lengthy conversations that the two leaders have had?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you said that next few days will tell the story, but it doesn\'t seem that so far that something has come out of it, that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to set up a deadline over the next few days.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that in the next few days, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get greater clarity about whether or not the Russians are willing to take some concrete steps toward this off-ramp here.</p>\n<p>But in terms of characterizing the calls, we have issued readouts and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in front of those.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for you to -- fair for people to take away from these readouts that at least as it relates to the view of the situation -- the U.S. view of the situation versus the Russian view of the situation in Ukraine, and in Crimea in particular, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty strong difference of opinion; that there is a disagreement about the facts related to what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening on the ground there.</p>\n<p>The best example of this is you saw in the news conference that President Putin convened earlier this week that he basically denied that there were Russian troops on the ground in Crimea outside their bases.\xc2\xa0 All of the available evidence indicates that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re having robust, direct, candid conversations between President Obama and President Putin.\xc2\xa0 That means acknowledging that there are basic differences over what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening on the ground in Crimea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the real test is whether or not the Russians are going to take advantage of this off-ramp that is available here.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the Russians will take the steps necessary to deescalate the situation -- by observing the basing agreements, by supporting elections, by entering into talks, facilitated by the international community, if necessary, with the Ukrainians to try to resolve all this.\xc2\xa0 And again, that could also include putting international monitors all throughout Ukraine to ensure that the rights of everybody, including ethnic Russians, are being respected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>President Putin has indicated that that\'s part of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the region, and it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the U.S. and the international community\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the region.\xc2\xa0 So there is some common ground here.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to paper over the differences that exist on some very basic facts on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the White House is in kind of a wait-and-see mode for a few days on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use those words, only because the President and senior members of our team remain very actively engaged in the situation.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to consult very closely with our allies around the globe, particularly the G7 nations that Jeff mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry will be in touch with his counterpart, having specific discussions about the way forward here.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of activity going on here even as we watch carefully to see what the Russian reaction might be.</p>\n<p>Other questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President have a message today for voters in next week\xe2\x80\x99s special congressional election?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The White House is obviously aware that there is a special congressional election on the other side of the state of Florida.\xc2\xa0 I know that that race has gotten a lot of national attention, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that in his event today that the President will be talking about it.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty focused today on this one core component of his domestic agenda, which is expanding the door -- expanding college education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a coincidence that he\xe2\x80\x99s there a few days ahead of the election?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s in a different part of the state, so, yes, it is a coincidence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have a very bare-bones week ahead.\xc2\xa0 At this point, we anticipate that the President and the First Family will return to Washington on Sunday.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President is really looking forward to welcoming the 2012 and 2013 Division I Men\xe2\x80\x99s and Women\xe2\x80\x99s NCAA National Champions at the White House.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President traditionally welcomes the NCAA champion football and basketball teams.\xc2\xa0 This will be an opportunity for the President to welcome the NCAA champions in some sports that don\xe2\x80\x99t get quite as much attention as those other more high-profile events.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to that.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President is planning to travel to New York City to participate in events to benefit the DNC and the DSCC.\xc2\xa0 At this point, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional events to announce.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate the President will be at the White House and participating in meetings on those days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one more -- sorry -- closer question to ask about this beer bet.\xc2\xa0 My editors asked me to ask specifically -- Prime Minister Harper said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten his beer yet from the Olympic hockey bet.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s with the delay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not privy to the details of the international beer delivery, but I can tell you that the President is somebody who makes good on his bets.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Prime Minister Harper and members of his team will soon be enjoying some delicious White House beer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:42 P.M.
