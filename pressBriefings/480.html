Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday to you all.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have a couple of things to say at the top.</p>\n<p>First of all, as some of you may have seen, today we announced that the President will host the fourth White House Science Fair next Tuesday, May 27th.\xc2\xa0 This year\xe2\x80\x99s fair will focus on girls and women who are excelling in STEM fields, and will highlight this administration\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to helping more women enter into STEM fields as part of our efforts to expand opportunity for all.</p>\n<p>The White House Science Fair will feature about 100 students from more than 30 states representing different STEM competitions that recognize the talents of our next generation of scientists, engineers, inventors and innovators.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to let you know that, on Wednesday, President Obama will host an event at the Department of the Interior where he will sign a proclamation establishing the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in south central New Mexico.\xc2\xa0 By establishing the monument, the President will permanently protect more than 496,000 acres to preserve the prehistoric, historic and scientific values of the area for the benefit of all Americans.\xc2\xa0 A recent independent study found that a new national monument could generate $7.5 million -- $7.4 million in new economic activity annually from new visitors and business opportunities, while preserving access for sportsmen, ranchers and recreational users.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This signing is part of our larger week-long focus on helping businesses invest here in America to further grow our economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss this more at a meeting here at the White House tomorrow with business leaders and at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown on Thursday.</p>\n<p>And now to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us a sense of what the House\xe2\x80\x99s role was either in signing off or approving these cyber espionage charges against these military officials?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, as you know, law enforcement actions taken by the Justice Department, the filing of criminal charges, are something that are appropriately handled as a law enforcement manner -- as a law enforcement matter.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case that President Obama has made cybersecurity a high priority for his administration, and it is specifically the case that the President has expressed publicly and directly with his Chinese counterparts our concerns over government-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business issues -- business information for commercial gains.</p>\n<p>So this is an issue that has been brought up by President Obama with President Xi in their meetings as recently as in March as a general problem that we have seen, and reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall concern about cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 We have consistently and candidly raised these concerns with the Chinese government.\xc2\xa0 And today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement reflects our growing concerns that this Chinese behavior has continued.</p>\n<p>Now, we remain committed to developing a constructive and productive relationship with China and are ready to work with China to prevent this activity from continuing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though it\xe2\x80\x99s DOJ that may actually be levying the charges, has there been any conversation with the Chinese on more of the national security/foreign policy front about why these charges are being levied?\xc2\xa0 And any concerns you may have about Chinese retaliation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a routine matter, we will often coordinate with foreign countries on law enforcement issues to request their assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that is true in this case as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean coordinate with the Chinese in order to identify these individuals?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We coordinate with them and ask for their assistance in connection with this case.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more detailed for you than that.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that, as I mentioned at the top, the President has conveyed his general concern about this issue to President Xi.\xc2\xa0 We have made it a top-line topic of conversation in our interactions with our Chinese counterparts.\xc2\xa0 The overall challenge posed by cybersecurity matters is one that this President has made a top priority for his administration, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that.</p>\n<p>As a broader matter, I think that the President would like to see -- and has made this clear, too, to his Chinese counterparts -- cooperation and coordination on issues of cybersecurity rather than disagreement on matters like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you feel that this is an example where you have received cooperation from the Chinese?\xc2\xa0 Have you worked with them to identify these officials?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just a little confused on the\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that we have worked with them to identify these officials, but that we seek their cooperation and assistance on matters like this, which would be routine in dealing with a foreign government and foreign nationals.\xc2\xa0 What I mean is that there is and has been an opportunity for cooperation and coordination on cybersecurity issues with the Chinese, and that is certainly what we have sought and continue to seek.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s also be clear that the President has identified this as a challenge.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear all along that when there are threats posed to our cybersecurity, to our government as well as our businesses, that he expects action to be taken and for there to be accountability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this action, while on a specific matter, reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment and focus on making sure that cybersecurity is a priority and that people are held accountable when there are compromises to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask on Russia, the Kremlin says that Putin is going to be pulling troops back from the border of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ve heard statements similar to this before.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the U.S. sees any sign that this time they may actually be following through on this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen reports of President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s orders for some Russian troops who were deployed for exercises on the Ukrainian border to return to their permanent bases.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been clear about our call for the Russian military to deescalate the tension there, so such a withdrawal would be welcome.\xc2\xa0 At this point, we see no indication of any movement, which has been the case, as you note, several times before.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s fair to say that we would know and would be able to confirm for you if the Russian military had, in fact, moved back, deployed away from the Ukrainian border, but we have not yet seen any indication that that\'s the case.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On China, this comes as tensions have also risen in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 Do these charges point to any broader deterioration of relations with China?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it reflects the clear-eyed nature or the clear-eyed approach that we take to our relations with China and other nations where we have matters where we disagree, but also areas where we can cooperate.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to making sure that we take action on cybersecurity, we\'re not going to sugarcoat our disagreements with any other nation on these issues, nor are we going to forego opportunities where we can find ground for cooperation and coordination.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Veterans Affairs issue, does the White House see any risk that there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for criminal charges in these cases?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Mark, there is an independent inspector general investigating this matter, and it is up to the IG, in this case, to include or refer to the Department of Justice for potential action on -- potential criminal action -- potential criminal behavior.\xc2\xa0 So I would refer you to the IG and to the Department of Justice for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is absolutely the case that the President strongly supports Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s request to the IG to investigate the allegations that have emerged around initially the Phoenix office and have spread elsewhere because he insists that we do everything we can to ensure that our veterans are getting the care that they deserve and that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting it in a timely fashion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, the Secretary is undertaking his own review.\xc2\xa0 The President signed off on transferring one of his top advisors here from the White House in order to increase the capacity over at the VA for this review.\xc2\xa0 Rob Nabors is now over there in place working with the Secretary and his team on the review of these allegations.\xc2\xa0 And he expects there to be an efficient and effective review of the situation and for remedial action to be taken if necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On one of the Sunday talk shows, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of Staff seemed to stop short of a full-throated expression of confidence in Secretary Shinseki.\xc2\xa0 Is the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in him still unwavering at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would disagree with that characterization.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Secretary Shinseki has in his tenure at the VA overseen significant progress on a number of fronts, overseen the increase in appropriations for the VA over the previous administration, significantly, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s request \xe2\x80\x93- included in his budget request; has overseen an increase in the services provided to our veterans, even as we have increased dramatically the number of veterans that are provided service because of the two wars that have been fought -\xe2\x80\x93 major wars, long wars -- one that has come to an end, another that is coming to an end; has overseen substantial progress in reducing the backlog in disability claims, even as Secretary Shinseki has overseen new policies instituted by this administration that allow for those who have illnesses associated with exposure to Agent Orange from the Vietnam War to have a presumption of a claim when they ask for a disability claim through the VA, and for those who suffer from PTSD as a result of their experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan to have the same presumption.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This has put significant stress on the system but it is absolutely the right thing to do, and that is why Secretary Shinseki from the time he came into office at Veterans Affairs has made these issues a priority.</p>\n<p>Mr. Shear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up and try to clarify on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s questions on China?\xc2\xa0 You said we coordinated with them and asked for their assistance in connection with this case.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said that as a general matter \xe2\x80\x93- this is basically in response to the question about whether or not we would raise this issue with China before the announcement that you saw was made.\xc2\xa0 And I would say, as a routine matter, we coordinate with foreign countries on law enforcement issues to request their assistance, and that is true in this case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, it is true in the sense that it is routine to notify and request the assistance of a foreign country when this kind of situation arises and an announcement like this is going to be made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is only -- who is the \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d in that sentence?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So generally no -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t be any more specific about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to Justice and State.\xc2\xa0 But as I understand it, the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the kind of assistance that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Both here and in Beijing, in terms of the request to the government, both here and in Beijing -- here, obviously, through the embassy -- for their assistance in connection with this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t be any more specific about what kind of assistance that would be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I cannot.\xc2\xa0 You may direct your questions to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing here are individuals identified and charged.\xc2\xa0 And the assistance you would seek from a foreign government in that matter may be self-evident.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about this announcement on Friday that the Under Secretary of Health over at Veterans Affairs, Robert Petzel, was leaving that department?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that he was already scheduled to leave the VA later on in the year, so how is that really any kind of accountability over at the VA?\xc2\xa0 And might we see other officials who were in charge in this area of overseeing veterans care and these wait times, might we see other officials leave that Department?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the issue of Dr. Petzel, I would hope that you had noted that the top official in charge -- he was -- of the veterans health system was requested to resign by the American Legion, and he did so the day that -- one day after his Senate testimony.\xc2\xa0 The American Legion said that the group looks at Petzel\xe2\x80\x99s resignation as a \xe2\x80\x9cstep towards addressing the leadership problem at the VA.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I think that undercuts the assertion that that is not a meaningful development.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the broader issue of accountability, we are of the view that the kinds of allegations that we have seen need to be investigated rigorously.\xc2\xa0 And once we know all the facts, it is absolutely appropriate that accountable individuals ought to be held to account.</p>\n<p>But we are not of the view, as a general matter, that the latter comes before the former.\xc2\xa0 The investigation needs to continue and needs to be completed, and then we can assess what the facts are.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the testimony by the inspector general that included an update on the progress he had made on some of the allegations, including those in reports by your network, and that there is still much to be learned about what happened in Phoenix.\xc2\xa0 And we eagerly await the results of that investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on that, when was the President first made aware of these problems, of these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times?\xc2\xa0 When was he first made aware of those problems?\xc2\xa0 And when did other White House officials, top White House officials become aware of these problems?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9cthese problems,\xe2\x80\x9d the fact that there have been bureaucracies --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The delays have been known for some time, but the fraudulent --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you mean the specific allegations that I think were reported first by your network out of Phoenix, I believe we learned about them through the reports.\xc2\xa0 I will double-check if that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s when we learned about them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when, as I understand, Secretary Shinseki learned about them and immediately took the action that he has taken, including instigating his own review -- or initiating his own review, but also requesting that the inspector general investigate.</p>\n<p>And I think, again, I would point you to his testimony as well as the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s testimony last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so do you think that these allegations just died at the VA?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems as there is just a whole crop of whistleblowers surfacing at all these different facilities around the country.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it just seems logical that these allegations, these accusations would at some point have made their way to the VA, and they would have been taken so seriously that they would have been addressed over here at the White House or at least brought to the attention of people here.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re confusing two things here.\xc2\xa0 I was responding to the question about when folks here found out about the Phoenix allegations.\xc2\xa0 For broader questions about reporting of potentially fraudulent waiting lists and other matters that have been raised in recent days and weeks, I would refer you to the Veterans Affairs Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on that -- because putting the fraudulent lists and the hiding of wait times aside, this issue of delays, inadequate care, this has been going on for a long time.\xc2\xa0 The President talked about this when he was running for President in August of 2007.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we fail to keep faith with our veterans, the bond between our nation and our nation\xe2\x80\x99s heroes becomes frayed.\xc2\xa0 When a veteran is denied care, we are all dishonored.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>And so does the President feel at this point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been basically dishonored by these allegations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He certainly stands by what he said then, and that is why when he was elected to this office, having said what he did about the care we need to provide to our veterans, he actively pursued significant increases in our budgets for veterans care -- substantially increasing the amount that we spend in order to take care of our veterans; substantially increasing the availability of services to veterans and availability of disability claims to veterans on his watch because of that sacred trust that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about.</p>\n<p>There is no question that a lot more work needs to be done. And Secretary Shinseki would be the first to tell you that, as he did last week when he testified.\xc2\xa0 And he expects --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he also said that \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding a 21st century VA to serve our veterans will be an equal priority to building a 21st century military to fight our wars.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Clearly, that 21st century Veterans Affairs has not been built if something like this is occurring.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I don\'t want to quibble with your assessments.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not at all suggesting that the allegations we have seen are not serious, which is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the response from the administration that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it is important to allow the investigations -- investigation and review to come to a completion so we can see what the facts are, and you can see the actions that Secretary Shinseki and others at the VA take in response to any revelations that are contained within the results of that investigation and that review.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand what really the U.S. wants to accomplish with Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s announcement regarding criminal cyber spying charges filed against five Chinese military.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Holder said this case serves as a \xe2\x80\x9cwake-up call to the seriousness of the ongoing cyber threat.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But the Chinese clearly don\xe2\x80\x99t need any wake-up calls since they are doing so.\xc2\xa0 So what is the wake-up call for?\xc2\xa0 And what is the U.S. hoping to see --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to obviously the comments by the Attorney General who spoke specifically about this matter and is the head of the Department of Justice, which is pursuing the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think as a broader matter, the issue of cybersecurity, and the threats posed by those who would compromise cybersecurity here in the United States, are real and growing.\xc2\xa0 And a case like this only highlights that fact.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Attorney General was referring to in those comments.</p>\n<p>We need to make sure that it is clear to everyone that we won\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate the kind of government-sponsored, cyber-enabled espionage, if you will, or threats against either our government cyber systems or our private sector cyber systems.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the -- that is the view that the President has taken from the beginning, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been very blunt about it in his conversations with his Chinese counterparts, and that bluntness has been reflected in the conversations that others in this administration have had with their counterparts.</p>\n<p>As I noted earlier, we strongly believe that we should be able to cooperate and coordinate with China on these matters, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to continue to be very clear and blunt about the kinds of problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that this case reflects.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm reports that Shaun Donovan is going to be leaving HUD and going over to OMB?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think you might expect, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements to make at this time.\xc2\xa0 When we have personnel announcements to make, we make them in the usual fashion.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Mr. Snowden about U.S. involvement in intelligence-gathering, what is the difference between the U.S. spying on Siemens and Mercedes-Benz and the like and what these five Chinese men are being accused of?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, without addressing any specific allegation that may have been made through the so-called disclosures revelations, there is no comparison here.\xc2\xa0 Since well before these recent disclosures, we have made clear that our signals intelligence programs serve a specific national security mission, and that does not include providing a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. economic interests.\xc2\xa0 In other words, we do not do what those Chinese nationals were indicted for earlier today -- period.\xc2\xa0 So there is a significant and important distinction between the gather of intelligence for national security reasons, which the United States does and surely China does and virtually every other nation on Earth does, and the gathering of economic data for the purpose of providing a competitive advantage to companies in your own country.\xc2\xa0 That is not something that the United States does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can assure us that any information gathered from Mercedes-Benz and Siemens in that case was not used --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address any specific allegation that you may be citing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say that, yes, I can assure you we do not gather intelligence for the benefit of U.S. companies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a question on the fallout -- because the Chinese Foreign Ministry has already said that it has pulled out of the U.S.-China Cyber Working Group.\xc2\xa0 And if that becomes a trend, some of the very platforms for the U.S. government to engage with China and cooperate with China over these issues will disappear.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the preparation at the White House to continue to cooperate given this announcement today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that open and frank dialogue with China and our allies and key international cyber actors is crucial to building trust and developing common rules of the road on this emerging strategic issue.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to engage China on areas of cooperation such as network defense and law enforcement investigations, as well as challenges such as military doctrine and cyber-enabled economic espionage.\xc2\xa0 We hope to see reciprocal efforts from Beijing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I was saying earlier, we believe there are ample and important areas where we can and should be able to cooperate with China on issues related to cybersecurity, but it is also very important that the rules of the road are established and that they\xe2\x80\x99re followed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the general principle that the President attaches to these issues as it relates to China and other nations.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to follow up on Cheryl and another topic real fast.\xc2\xa0 What does this administration do when it comes to vetting a possible candidate for an open position that could be coming up soon, what have you, in this environment right now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think our processes are any different than previous administrations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed checklist for you for how that process works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we quickly approach 2016, is the possibility of running for President something --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that quickly I hope.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, okay.\xc2\xa0 But is the process of running for President something that could strike out a candidate for any position that could be open in the future?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When the President seeks to appoint individuals to significant positions in his administration, he looks for their qualifications, obviously, and seeks to appoint the very best people to the positions that are open.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any criteria related to the issue you just raised.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you think about Mayor Castro?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You probably remember that President Obama asked Mayor Castro to deliver the keynote address at the President\xe2\x80\x99s convention in 2012.\xc2\xa0 I think that reflects the high regard that President Obama holds -- in which President Obama holds Mayor Castro.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s mayor of a significantly sized city and has done an excellent job in that position.\xc2\xa0 How\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you the next question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report that a New Hampshire policeman said some very negative things about this President.\xc2\xa0 People are calling for him to resign.\xc2\xa0 What is this White House saying about that?\xc2\xa0 And does the President know about this story?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken about it with him and I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in terms of General Shinseki, I understand the vote of confidence right now, but if this mess regarding wait times isn\xe2\x80\x99t cleaned up soon, are General Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s days numbered as VA Secretary?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, our position on this is that Secretary Shinseki has presided over a VA that has significantly increased the access that veterans have to disability claims, significantly increased the number of veterans who are provided benefits, including health benefits, and has committed himself from the moment he was sworn into office to addressing the huge challenges that our growing population of veterans and the services that they need create for this country.\xc2\xa0 He has aggressively implemented policies that reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s high priority\xc2\xa0 -- the high priority the President associates with providing benefits to our veterans, and that is reflected in the way that is often the case here in Washington with the fact that the President has sought every year significant increases in the VA budget when he has submitted his budgets.\xc2\xa0 And that focus will continue.</p>\n<p>What the President wants is for the review and the investigation to be completed and for action to be taken to address any problems that are identified by the review and the investigation, and for individuals to be held accountable if that is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 But before we make that determination we need to see what the results of the investigation and the review are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, are you suggesting, regarding Dr. Petzel, that he was forced to resign because of this controversy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to previous statements made by Secretary Shinseki and others, and leave it at that.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that he did resign.\xc2\xa0 He was identified as somebody that the American Legion thought should be held responsible, and I would point you to what the American Legion said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Having said that, I do believe it is important, as I noted earlier, that this investigation and this review be allowed to be conducted and completed, and for us to make judgments about exactly what did happen in Phoenix and elsewhere and what didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and what the causes of what happened were and who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for what happened, and whether or not anybody should be held accountable for what happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, how can you suggest that his resignation comes as accountability when the VA put out a press release on September 20th saying he was leaving?\xc2\xa0 That\'s almost eight months ago.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I would refer you to what the American --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, his predecessor was nominated two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t care what the American Legion has to say.\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking what you have to say.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to the American Legion, which obviously has deep interest in this matter and has been reported on significantly by your network and others in terms of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said about this issue, and note that they look at Dr. Petzel\xe2\x80\x99s resignation as \xe2\x80\x9ca step towards addressing the leadership problem at the VA.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\'ll leave it at that.\xc2\xa0 Those are the words that they said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any concern that the person that has been nominated to take over Dr. Petzel had responsibility over one of the hospitals at the center of this scandal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that, as you know, the Secretary invited the independent IG to investigate the situation and we won\'t presuppose the outcome of that investigation, although we eagerly await its results.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, if the investigation finds any instances of wrongdoing, any individuals involved will be held accountable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to Jeffrey Murawsky, the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to be the Under Secretary for Health for the Veterans Health Administration, as required by law, he was one of the finalists recommended by a formal commission that included outside health experts and researchers, as well as representatives from veteran service organizations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And with that, I\'ll go to Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, from your response to Jon and to Mark on Shinseki, I conclude that the President no longer has confidence in him.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You completely misinterpret and falsely conclude --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say the President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has confidence in Secretary Shinseki.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On another subject, on China, on the hacking activity -- does the administration think that this might slow down the Chinese hacking temporarily as it did when the report came out in February?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice in terms of the actions they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken specifically on this matter.\xc2\xa0 What the actions do represent or reflect is the President\xe2\x80\x99s keen interest in cybersecurity, and that interest will not diminish at all.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we certainly expect is to continue to discuss with the Chinese our concerns around these matters, as well as our belief that there is opportunity for cooperation and coordination when it comes to cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 How would five people from China ever consider coming over here to stand trial in an American courtroom?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the Department of Justice and perhaps the Department of State on issues like that. I think the implication of the question is that individuals shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be charged in that case, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is the way that anyone here would view these matters when it comes to making sure that justice is served.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking why they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- why would they come to America --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on VA -- when you say repeatedly that the White House is waiting for the results of the VA investigation, how do you respond to the Washington Times reporting that they have documents from the 2008 presidential transition that warned the administration that there were problems of VA hospital wait times?\xc2\xa0 If you knew about it almost six years ago, why are you still waiting for the results of this investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is, the fact that, as I think someone noted earlier -- the fact is, then-candidate Obama, then-senator Obama identified problems within the VA and committed himself, should he be elected, to making sure that we enhance the budgets that we provided to the Veterans Affairs Department so that we could better serve our veterans.\xc2\xa0 And what you have seen since he took office is a commitment to just that: increases in the budget authority every year over what had been the case under the previous administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that reporting that you cite also noted that there had been essentially no change in the previous years in terms of these issues.\xc2\xa0 And what you have seen, as a broader matter, in this administration and under the leadership of Secretary Shinseki, is an incredibly aggressive attack on the problem of the huge backlog in disability claims, one that was exacerbated for the right reasons by this administration because we committed to veterans who suffer from illnesses associated with exposure to Agent Orange, that they would have a presumption of acceptance should they submit a disability claim related to that.\xc2\xa0 And the same is the case with those who suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder who were veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars -- again, making the decision that was the right decision for our veterans and those who were suffering from conditions related to their service that, in turn, put more stress on the system and then making sure that we committed the resources necessary to attack the challenges created.</p>\n<p>That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re all solved, Ed.\xc2\xa0 We would never suggest that.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Shinseki made clear that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t view it that way and that he is, to quote him, \xe2\x80\x9cmad as hell\xe2\x80\x9d at the allegations that have arisen out of the Phoenix office and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that the right thing to do is to fully investigate, fully review, take action to fix the problems that are identified, and make sure that the services are being provided to our veterans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the administration was warned about at least hospital wait times in the 2008 transition, it would suggest two things.\xc2\xa0 One, this problem predated this administration, correct? That there were problems with hospital wait times in 2008 that were made in 2006, 2007, and that\'s why Senator Obama mentioned it in 2007, right?\xc2\xa0 That the previous administration had this problem, too.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is evident, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be evident.\xc2\xa0 So the second part that would be evident is if you were warned about it in the transition, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you do something in 2009, 2010, 2011?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely -- which is that we asked for and received from Congress significant increases in the Veterans Affairs budget.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, we saw an increase obviously in the number of veterans demanding services from the VA because of the long wars in Afghanistan and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you threw more money at it, which is great.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I think that\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not getting to the veterans.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not the case.\xc2\xa0 Again, you have more veterans being served through health centers around the country.\xc2\xa0 You have more veterans having the availability of disability claims approved through that process; remember there are two separate processes overseen by the VA.\xc2\xa0 And those two facts put additional stress on the system; require additional support and funding from the administration, from the government, from Congress.\xc2\xa0 And what we will undoubtedly see as a result of this investigation and review -- at least probably, if not undoubtedly -- is the need to take some other action to ensure that our veterans are getting the care they deserve.</p>\n<p>And where there is wrongdoing, the President will insist that those responsible for the wrongdoing are held accountable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if all these great things are happening, why do you keep saying and Denis McDonough is saying the President is mad as hell --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s mad as hell at hearing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And where is he?\xc2\xa0 Why is he not expressing that to us?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from him at some point on this issue soon.\xc2\xa0 And he did speak to this I think in response -- I can\'t remember if it was to your question or somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s -- when these allegations first arose.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What he has also done is acted.\xc2\xa0 He has strongly supported the action taken by Secretary Shinseki.\xc2\xa0 He has sent over one of his most trusted advisors from the White House, Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors, to assist in that review.\xc2\xa0 And he expects results from the review and he hopes for results from the independent investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing on a different topic, health care.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post had a story over the weekend suggesting that there\xe2\x80\x99s a major problem with the subsidies that are going to approximately 1 million Americans, that they may be getting more subsidy than they deserve based on income.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting it\xe2\x80\x99s a major problem, number one.\xc2\xa0 And number two, you have some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s allies on the left saying there needs to be a CEO brought in to help implement this law.\xc2\xa0 How do you react to all that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first question about so-called inconsistencies, an inconsistency does not mean there is a problem with a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s enrollment.\xc2\xa0 It means that the consumer has attested that they have more information to provide to support their application for coverage, and CMS is working through those cases.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all individuals, like consumers are, consumers experience regular changes in income, they get married, divorced or get a new job or a raise, some of you maybe have gotten one.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that there are some times when they\xe2\x80\x99d have more recent information than the data source checked at the time of their application.</p>\n<p>In many cases, it means that the consumer has experienced a change in income since filing their 2012 tax returns.\xc2\xa0 Again, not unusual, and CMS is working through these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the other issue of personnel matter, look, the President is absolutely committed to both learning the lessons that we all had to learn when the website functioned so poorly at the beginning of the rollout in October, and is very focused on ensuring that we have effective implementation of the ACA going forward.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in some of the personnel announcements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made here at the White House, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll -- we\xe2\x80\x99re, as a general matter, open to suggestions when it comes to ensuring that this law is implemented in a way that makes sure that all the Americans, the millions of Americans who seek quality, affordable health insurance who have signed up for quality and affordable health insurance get it and are properly served.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You seem very eager to rely on the American Legion\xe2\x80\x99s statement on Dr. Petzel\xe2\x80\x99s resignation but not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply pointing that on the issue --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but not on what the American Legion wants with General Shinseki.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear our view on Secretary Shinseki and the service he\xe2\x80\x99s provided.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to what Secretary Shinseki has said about Dr. Petzel and what the American Legion has said about Dr. Petzel, because these questions are asked in large part in response to those who have called for personnel actions in response to some of these allegations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why should we view this as sort of window dressing -- sort of politically advantageous because you know he was already leaving so it looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re taking action.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can view it any way you like.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to what the American Legion has said.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say, as I said earlier, that the Secretary and the President eagerly await the results of the independent investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then why is Dr. Petzel gone?\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re eagerly awaiting the investigation -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s where this sort of feels like a chasing-our-tail here.\xc2\xa0 Either you want this to be seen as taking immediate action you want over here, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wait for an investigation.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I would suggest to you that I was answering a question; I\xe2\x80\x99m not proactively pushing this out.\xc2\xa0 I simply pointed to what the American Legion said and to what others have said about his resignation.\xc2\xa0 I would note that, as a general matter, we believe that the investigation ought to be completed and the results examined.\xc2\xa0 We eagerly await the results of that investigation as we do the results of the review that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you didn\xe2\x80\x99t push Dr. Petzel out, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say here?\xc2\xa0 That nobody pushed him out?\xc2\xa0 This is not a firing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the VA has addressed this, so I would refer you to the VA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys -- should we characterize this as a firing or not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make some editorial decisions on your own.\xc2\xa0 I am simply referring you to what the VA said and what the American Legion said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, I want to ask you, on China.\xc2\xa0 Just 11 months ago the President came out with President Xi, you guys talked about working through this issue together.\xc2\xa0 A month later, there was a working group, you guys hear the President reiterate it -- concerns about this, but welcome joint efforts to develop rules, norms, behavior in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear this has fallen apart. We had a diplomatic crisis with China on the issue of cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is diplomacy dead on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 We certainly think there is ample opportunity for cooperation and coordination on these issues.\xc2\xa0 What today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement reflects is our growing concerns that the behavior that\xe2\x80\x99s been identified by China has continued, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Government-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain is not something we can tolerate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the President\xe2\x80\x99s position all along.\xc2\xa0 He has been extremely candid, both publicly and privately, about this matter as it relates to China and other nations, and will continue to be so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned this is going to -- the entire sort of -- this bilateral economic, every six months -- this diplomatic situation you guys set up so that every six months you guys have this working group, that it could destroy the whole working group?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that it is in the interest of both nations to pursue cooperation and coordination on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work toward that end in our engagement with China.</p>\n<p>We have a tremendously broad relationship with China, and it is both economic and political and military, security-related.\xc2\xa0 And we will pursue our interests across the board in our engagement with China.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there are numerous areas where our interests coincide and where there is opportunity for cooperation and coordination, and an opportunity to deepen our ties with China and our strong and important relationship with China.</p>\n<p>But where we see significant problems, where we see a failure to play by the rules, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to shy away from discussing that directly or publicly, or taking the kind of action that today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement reflects.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any punishment for Syria or for Russia for failure to eradicate all the -- get rid of the chemical weapons by June 30th?\xc2\xa0 There just seems to be pessimism that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen -- that they\xe2\x80\x99re hiding the last 7.5 percent, they\xe2\x80\x99re not being forthcoming, inspectors can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get their hands on it.\xc2\xa0 They clearly are not going to turn this over by June 30th, so what\xe2\x80\x99s the punishment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, we believe they can and should meet the deadline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you acknowledge they\xe2\x80\x99re not trying right now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 92.5 percent of -- based on your 7.5 percent figure -- 92.5 percent of the Syrian regime\xe2\x80\x99s chemical stockpiles that were identified have been removed for destruction.\xc2\xa0 We are absolutely, as our partners are, concerned about the Assad regime keeping its commitment to allow for the removal of the remaining 7.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly, as I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the most dangerous part.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we talk about percentages -- this is the worst part.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- as I spoke about from this podium earlier, the precursors associated with that 7.5 to 8 percent are very serious, and we expect Syria to keep its commitment.\xc2\xa0 We expect Russia, which essentially vouched for Syria in this matter, to keep its commitment.</p>\n<p>And finally, I would say that today is May 19th, and June 30th is still a number of weeks away.\xc2\xa0 We want to see action by Syria to fulfill its commitment to remove the remaining chemical weapons from that country for destruction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be repercussions should they --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will certainly -- we certainly expect Syria to comply, and we expect Russia to ensure that Syria complies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be repercussions if either side doesn\'t?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\'t say that publicly, that any repercussions --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we want to see action now, and we take this matter very seriously and will continue to press for the complete removal of the chemical weapons stockpile.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say that under the President\xe2\x80\x99s watch the VA system has gotten better -- better funded, provides better care than it did when he first started -- and that these problems are a result of -- the word you\xe2\x80\x99ve invoked many times today --\xe2\x80\x9cstresses\xe2\x80\x9d in the system and not rampant mismanagement and/or fraud?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the specific problems that have been identified and the allegations associated with the problems that have been identified are under investigation and review.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of what was the cause and nature of those problems and whether or not these allegations -- either some or in total -- are, in fact, proven true we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait until we see the results of the investigation what we can actually say conclusively about that.</p>\n<p>I think as a general matter, there is no question that this administration has asked for and received and overseen the disbursement of and implementation of enhanced funding for our veterans through the VA because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to improved services for our veterans.\xc2\xa0 And you have seen the decisions that this administration has made to expand the care and expand the access to disability claims that veterans have reflected in the policies overseen by Secretary Shinseki at the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is no question that there are challenges that still need to be met at the VA, and Secretary Shinseki addressed those challenges in his testimony last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that some of the stresses in the system are the inadvertent and unexpected result of some of the policy decisions this administration has made to expand and give presumptions of care to certain things that were not given the presumption before?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that when I say that adding to the disability claim backlog by expanding access to those who seek disability claims, I think I\'m saying the answer is yes to that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that when you increase the population of people who have access to disability claims and you therefore add to the disability claim backlog, you\'re adding stress to the system.\xc2\xa0 But it was the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And that is why Secretary Shinseki has taken the lead -- and the White House has been keenly interested in his efforts in this area -- at attacking the size of the disability backlog.\xc2\xa0 And it has been reduced fully 50 percent in just the last year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Still work to be done.\xc2\xa0 Still too many people waiting too long for their claims to be processed.\xc2\xa0 But it reflects the commitment that the President has, that Secretary Shinseki has, and that others here have to our veterans and to making sure that they get the care that they deserve, that they earned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on this bill the House will take up later this week, the Veterans Administration Management Accountability Act, which in its writing is supposed to give senior managers more authority to punish and fire those who perform or do not meet -- underperform or do not meet expectations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the administration shares Congress\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about making sure that there is accountability and effectiveness at the VA, and we\'re working to address the problems that have surfaced.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll look closely at the bill.\xc2\xa0 We certainly share the goals that the bill represents -- ensuring accountability at the VA.\xc2\xa0 And while working with Congress to address some of the concerns we have with the details -- as we work with Congress to address some of the concerns we have with the details of the bill, I want to make clear that we share its goal of enhanced accountability.</p>\n<p>We\'ve also directed -- the President has -- Secretary Shinseki to make sure that the VA is maximizing its use of existing authorities to ensure accountability so that all the tools already available under the law to the VA to hold people accountable are being used even as we assess this bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said today he thought it might be time to rethink Russia\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the OSCE and NATO.\xc2\xa0 And if you take the third announcement now from Russia that it might be moving troops back, you have the upcoming elections on the 25th, can you give us an appraisal of the environment you see around this issue and if it is improving, or if some of the long-term expectations this administration had about sustained application of diplomatic and economic pressure are actually bearing fruit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, unless and until Russia takes concrete and verifiable action to assist in the stabilization of Ukraine and to allow for the effective electoral process to take place on May 25, I think the jury is out.\xc2\xa0 As of now, Russia continues to be unhelpful in this process.\xc2\xa0 Certainly it is a welcome announcement from President Putin or through his spokesman that Russia will draw down some of its troops from the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, we have heard that promise before and have yet to see any indication that it\'s been fulfilled.</p>\n<p>We remain very clear in our position that not only has Russia been extremely unhelpful in its efforts to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine, but that its so-called annexation of Crimea was and is illegal, and will not and has not been recognized by the United States or the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we are focused on now is the presidential election on May 25th.\xc2\xa0 And it is very important that the Ukrainian people be allowed to make their own choice about their country\xe2\x80\x99s future and their country\xe2\x80\x99s leader.\xc2\xa0 And we call upon Russia to use its influence with separatists in eastern and southern Ukraine to ensure that those separatists don\'t take action to undermine the electoral process in Ukraine, because we would view that very dimly indeed.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear, as have our European partners, that should Russia take steps to undermine those elections, or that election, that there will be additional costs imposed on Russia by the United States and by our partners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, after these charges to the Chinese, this move from the DOJ, does the Vice President bring a message of anti-cybercrime when he goes to Romania, which is a European hotbed of cybercrime, when he goes this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific agenda for the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to go over with you.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to his office.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the issue of cybersecurity is a matter that is of great concern to the United States in our relations not just with China, but other countries.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to the office of the Vice President for more on his trip and the agenda associated with it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when the President golfed on Saturday with Joe O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, who is the president and CEO of Public Strategies Washington, does that violate or tarnish somewhat the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise to limit access for lobbyists to the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he played a game of golf, Jared.</p>\n<p>Julia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the VA again, just a couple quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Can you shed any more light on what Rob Nabors is doing over at the VA? \xc2\xa0Give us a sense of either his schedule, how he\xe2\x80\x99s operating, anything like that -- what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specifics beyond noting that he was dispatched at Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s request and with the full support of the President and the Chief of Staff here to work with the Secretary on the review that the Secretary is undertaking.\xc2\xa0 For specifics on Rob\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, which I\'m sure is full, I\'d refer you to the VA.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:14 P.M.
