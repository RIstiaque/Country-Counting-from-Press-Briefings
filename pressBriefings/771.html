Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:40 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s cold.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s winter out there.\xc2\xa0 It was winter last night.\xc2\xa0 It was a dramatic change in the weather at that late hour.\xc2\xa0 Then I went home.\xc2\xa0 So, given that -- (laughter) -- we\'re going to move very quickly through this briefing today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I want to welcome you to the first full day of the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous honor and privilege to be here working for this President and for the country.\xc2\xa0 And I know, because I remember being where you are, what an honor and privilege it is to be where you are covering a White House.\xc2\xa0 So, with that, I just want to say thanks, and I\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I know last week you said that you were encouraged by the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 decision to move forward on a debt ceiling package, but I\'m wondering if you support the specific proposal that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote on tomorrow, this three-month extension.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 First, the President has always been clear that it is not good for the economy to raise the debt ceiling in increments or short- term periods, that what we support is a long-term raising of the debt ceiling so that we don\'t have any doubt or uncertainty for businesses or the global economy about the simple proposition that the United States always pays its bills.</p>\n<p>Having said that, what we saw happen last week was significant, in our view.\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans made a decision to back away from the kind of brinksmanship that was very concerning to the markets, very concerning to business, very concerning to the American people -- the simple proposition that they would insist on cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, in return for doing their job, paying their bills.\xc2\xa0 That was obviously something the President could not and would not support.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he made clear he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that the House Republicans have made this decision is certainly something that we welcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you support the idea that they\'re going to vote on something that would only continue this for three months?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we support the idea that the debt ceiling ought not to be a political football; that by becoming that does damage to our economy.\xc2\xa0 So we would clearly -- we want to see the debt ceiling sort of removed from the process of the very important debates that we have over what we pay for, how much revenue we bring in, how we get our fiscal house in order in a way that helps the economy grow, protects vulnerable citizens, seniors and middle-class families and moves the country forward.</p>\n<p>So we\'ll see what the Congress produces, what emerges.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously concerns I think both in the House and the Senate about some aspects of this, and once it does we\'ll take -- we\'ll evaluate it.\xc2\xa0 But I just want to make it clear that what happened, as I think most of you reported, was a very significant development in terms of deescalating the sense of conflict over this and reducing fear about a process that always had the potential of spinning out of control -- as it did in the summer of 2011, which caused such great harm to our economy; created the month, in August of 2011, that was the lowest month in terms of job creation during this entire recovery; certainly did harm to the markets and overall economic growth.\xc2\xa0 So we welcome that development.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is basically better than nothing, but still --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect -- we take heart from the numerous statements by Republicans leading up to this decision, statements in which Republicans made clear that it was not the right thing to do to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States; it was not the right thing to do to try to extract demands from the President of the Democratic Party in exchange for doing the responsible thing, which is paying the bills that you\'ve already incurred.\xc2\xa0 And we believe, when Senator Cornyn or others say we will not default, period, we will not let that happen. That we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully that will inform decisions made by Republicans in Congress going forward.</p>\n<p>In the end, it\'s in the long-term interest of the United States economy that we remove the debt ceiling from this process that creates uncertainty, harms economic growth, does damage to the middle class, puts a stranglehold on markets.\xc2\xa0 I mean, none of the outcomes here are good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We can, as the President made clear, negotiate in good faith towards further fiscal -- further deficit reduction, towards putting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 We need to do that, and the President is eager to do that -- more deficit reduction in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 We have already achieved nearly $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction, but there is more work to do.\xc2\xa0 But we have to do it in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair and balanced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just quickly on climate change.\xc2\xa0 The President was pretty extensive in his remarks on climate change in his inaugural address yesterday.\xc2\xa0 What was he trying to signal about where climate change would fall on his priority list in a second term, and is there any upcoming action that you can point to that he\'s going to take on that topic?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear since he took office that tackling climate change and enhancing energy security was and will be among his top priorities -- will be among his top priorities in a second term.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday he reiterated that commitment, as you said, in his inaugural address.</p>\n<p>Let\'s take a step back and look at what the President was able to achieve in a first term.\xc2\xa0 He took historic action -- his administration did -- to confront climate change, including proposing the first national standard for harmful carbon pollution for new power plants, as well as establishing unprecedented standards for cars and trucks that will slash emissions of carbon pollution while, at the same time, saving consumers billions of dollars.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\'s often forgotten because this is an executive action that he did in concert with major automobile companies, but taken by itself this single action did more to reduce carbon pollution than any other action that has been taken, in our view.\xc2\xa0 And we need to continue to build on that.\xc2\xa0 And the President intends to continue to build on that progress in the second term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is not only an issue of helping our climate and the environment, but it\'s one of our national security.\xc2\xa0 So when we pursue energy independence, when we continue to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by increasing domestic production of fossil fuel energy but other forms of energy, we enhance our security and protect America\'s future in that way.\xc2\xa0 And we also contribute to the effort to deal with climate change and all the impacts of climate change.</p>\n<p>Reuters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also talked about immigration yesterday, Jay.\xc2\xa0 How soon -- will he submit a plan, an immigration overhaul plan, and how quickly will he do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken to this in the last several weeks and he made clear his intention to act on this very important issue early in his second term, and he will keep that commitment.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a programmatic timetable for you today, but you can expect that he will move forward with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I will remind people that comprehensive immigration reform, like so many of the issues that he talked about yesterday, is something that we can unite behind, that we can come together to act on.\xc2\xa0 It has been an issue in the past.\xc2\xa0 It has enjoyed bipartisan support from very prominent Republicans as well as Democrats.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the right thing to do for our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President said, we shouldn\'t be giving foreign students degrees in computer science and engineering, and then expelling them from the country if they want to stay here and build businesses and help our economy grow.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that he hopes and believes will enjoy bipartisan support when he addresses it, and he will address it early in his second term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, the Nebraska Governor has approved the route for the Keystone Pipeline.\xc2\xa0 How is this going to impact -- I mean, can he now go forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are stages in this process.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the State Department is conducting its assessment, as appropriate and as has been standard over the years, on behalf of the federal government, and I don\'t want to get ahead of that process.\xc2\xa0 When the State Department has something to move forward on, we\'ll obviously address that issue when it does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it\'s interesting you mentioned the Nebraska Governor -- this whole process, as you remember, got sort of derailed because of insistence on sort of politicizing something that was not political.\xc2\xa0 It was a process that followed the format that had been used in the past in terms of the State Department\'s role in including these kinds of pipelines when they cross international boundaries.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that delayed or postponed this process had to do with the opposition of the Nebraska Governor and others in that state to the route that Keystone was proposed to take, the pipeline was proposed to take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think it\'s just an instructive reminder about how this ended up where it is now.\xc2\xa0 But for now, the State Department has the reins.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify on that, the next and final stages for the State Department to give final approval to the route and that\'s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to State on where they are on that process and what happens.\xc2\xa0 I would have to refresh my memory on how that process then works from there.\xc2\xa0 But right now, I don\'t want to get ahead of it, because the State Department has it.\xc2\xa0 That was -- as you know, and we all discussed this issue a lot last year, that is the stage that was necessary and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re in receipt of a letter from the Governor of Nebraska?\xc2\xa0 They said --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know personally if we are, but I don\'t dispute that we are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President laid out a number of priorities for his second term, not just immigration and climate change but also talked about tax reform, deficit reduction, as well as expansion of rights.\xc2\xa0 Is there one among them that is his top priority?\xc2\xa0 Let me stop there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His top priority is what it has been since he began running for this office in 2007, which is to restore the middle class and a sense of security that the middle class had been losing in the decade prior to him taking office.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo all of these agenda items that you mention are in service of the bigger goal here, which is to help the economy grow; help it provide more security to middle-class Americans; help it provide more ladders of opportunity to those who would move into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So that is the animation behind everything he does when it comes to -- especially to domestic policy.\xc2\xa0 And it is the sort of motivating factor behind what he talked about yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that moving on deficit reduction this year is imperative to expanding the opportunities for the middle class?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 He wants to build on the significant deficit reduction that he has already achieved with Congress, close to $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity here that we saw in the negotiations with the Speaker late last year that, if we move forward on it, could allow us to achieve additional significant deficit reduction that, taken as a whole, will mean that we will have hit the target of $4 trillion over 10 years, which will allow us to reduce our deficits and debt as a share of GDP in a way that will enhance economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>So that is absolutely something he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time over the last couple years on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that as we move -- now that the Republicans have appeared to set aside flirtation with default as a means to move forward in these negotiations, that maybe we can make some additional progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, is the President personally aware of the criticism the speech has received from some conservatives who feel it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough to reach out to them, that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t include enough olive branches to Republicans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with him about that.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that, broadly, the speech seemed to have been well received and that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- what you heard the President talk about yesterday is completely in keeping with the major speeches he has given throughout his national political career, going back to the Convention address in 2004 in Boston where he talked about the fact that -- as he did yesterday -- we are not Republicans or Democrats first; we are Americans first.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he made clear at the end of his speech yesterday that the oath he took -- both yesterday and the day before -- is very similar to the oath that members of Congress take, very similar to the oath that men and women in our armed forces take, and similar to the pledge that we make to our flag, every American makes.\xc2\xa0 And the fundamental fact there is that we make these pledges and we give these oaths not to a party but to our country.\xc2\xa0 And even though we have our differences, we need to act together to achieve things for the common good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that has been our history as a country and that is what the President believes will be our future in the next four years and beyond, because some of these fights that we\'ve had, these disputes over the role of government, will obviously continue.\xc2\xa0 They won\'t be resolved, and we can\'t wait for them to be resolved before we act.\xc2\xa0 And I think despite all of our differences in the last two and four years, we have achieved significant things together.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to doing just that.</p>\n<p>Some of the items that he talked about -- I mean, it\'s hardly -- like we were just talking about comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a -- some of the leaders of that effort are major figures in the Republican Party -- George W. Bush and John McCain.\xc2\xa0 And that could be and should be the way it will be in the future, and the President hopes that\'s the case.</p>\n<p>Jon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clarify for me the three-month extension on the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Does the President encourage members of the House to vote for that bill?\xc2\xa0 And will he sign it?\xc2\xa0 Would he veto it?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the position on the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said, the bill still has to overcome some concerns expressed by members of the House and the Senate before it can pass both chambers and reach the President\'s desk.\xc2\xa0 If it does and it reaches the President\'s desk, he would not stand in the way of the bill becoming law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, I would point you to what I said at the top, which is that the President\'s position is we have to remove these damaging fights over fulfilling our obligations to pay our bills from the process -- well, we have to remove them entirely because they\'re so unhelpful to economic growth; they\'re so unhelpful to the middle class; they create terrible uncertainty for our businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We can continue to engage, and we will, with members of Congress over the need to further reduce our deficit in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward plans, as you know, that demonstrate the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to compromise, that he is willing to meet Republicans halfway on these issues, and he will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But the debt needs to not be a part of that, because it\'s terrible for the economy and it seems also to be bad politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on climate change, can you help me understand specifically what the President wants to pursue in the second term on this?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that -- does he have legislation he would like to see Congress pass?\xc2\xa0 Are we back to cap and trade?\xc2\xa0 What specifically does he want to do that he didn\'t in the first term?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has long supported congressional action on climate change.\xc2\xa0 And while it\'s clear that bipartisan opposition to legislative action is still a reality, the President\'s position remains the same as it was in the first term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He looks forward to building on the achievements made in the first term.\xc2\xa0 And he looks at this in a broad way, because this isn\'t -- deficit reduction, for example, is not a goal unto itself.\xc2\xa0 We pursue it in a way that helps our economy grow and helps it create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise, it\'s not worth the effort, in his mind.</p>\n<p>Climate change is not -- you don\'t pursue action that helps deal with that problem just because of the problem itself, but because there are huge opportunities there in alternative energy. Whether anyone in Washington or elsewhere likes it or not, clean energy technology is going to be a huge part of a 21st century global economy.\xc2\xa0 We can make choices now that ensure that those industries are domestic, that we dominate those fields of endeavor and we create the jobs associated with those industries here in America -- or we can substitute our dependence on foreign oil for a dependence on imports of clean energy technology.\xc2\xa0 So the President believes that would be shortsighted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So he looks at this in a more holistic way, and he will move forward in implementing some of the actions that he took in the first term, and building on the progress that was made in the first term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he dedicated more of that speech to climate change than any other specific policy area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would encourage everyone who looks at the speech not to break it apart, because we view the inaugural address -- the President views the inaugural address, and the speech he will give to Congress on February 12th, the State of the Union address, as part of a package -- as two parts of a package.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as has been tradition, and a tradition the President is keeping, inaugural addresses tend to be about the President\'s vision -- that certainly was the case yesterday -- about how we move forward together as a country.\xc2\xa0 Policy specifics and -- I think for those who do this in Washington, like number of words dedicated to each issue and which position they achieve in the address -- I\'ll probably discourage you from doing that after he gives the State of the Union, but it\'s more appropriate for an address like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why did it get such a prominent focus in this speech and such a relatively narrow focus, if at all, in the campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I contest that assertion, because, in fact, he raised the challenge of climate change frequently in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 He talked about it in press conferences, at recent press conference, as well as when asked about it, he addressed fully his commitment to dealing with this challenge and the impact it has on our economy and our people.</p>\n<p>So it\'s an important issue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a priority.\xc2\xa0 But it is not a singular priority, it is one of a host of priorities that he believes we can act on if we work together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he run a single ad during the entire campaign that invoked climate change?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the ad-makers.\xc2\xa0 I decided early on in that process not to view every ad that was broadcast, because who would have the time?\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t remember, but it was certainly an issue that he talked about frequently on the campaign trail, and it\'s one that he believes is a priority.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to follow up on Jonathan, cap and trade, that legislation that died in the Senate in 2010 -- is that the beginning point for the President?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said that the President has long supported congressional action, but he recognizes that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a lot has happened --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- there is bipartisan opposition to legislative action, as there was in the first term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- something new needs to be drafted?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speculate for you about future actions.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that he believes it\'s a priority.\xc2\xa0 He has a record already of historic accomplishments in this area, but more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to building on the progress that was achieved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m just trying to figure out how his prioritization translates into new legislative action.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about next steps on that issue.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure, as he made clear yesterday, that it is an important priority that we need to work on together for the sake of the economy.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to doing that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the President would not stand in the way if a piece of legislation similar to what is being voted on in the House tomorrow passes.\xc2\xa0 That means he would sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It means he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the way.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clearly, we support extension of the debt ceiling without drama or delay.\xc2\xa0 That has been his position forever -- as President and since we\'ve had these rather novel debates about whether or not we should engage in games of chicken over the full faith and credit of the United States.</p>\n<p>He believes that we ought to do this for longer periods of time.\xc2\xa0 He believes that if it\'s too onerous for Congress -- Republicans in Congress to deal with this responsibility that they can turn it over to him.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll take the heat for making sure that we pay our bills, because it\'s the responsible and right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 So if that were what transpires after this next round if Congress produces something, he would welcome that.</p>\n<p>But again, we cannot forget -- and I think -- I\'m sure you talked about, if not wrote about it -- the major step that seems to have been taken by Republicans in acknowledging that using the debt ceiling for leverage did no one any good.\xc2\xa0 The President wasn\'t going to negotiate over this.\xc2\xa0 The threat of default alone was already causing harm to the economy and concern to business. And we certainly welcome what appears to be a decision by many Republicans to not pursue that strategy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable with what appears to be a coincidental convergence of the sequester and the continuing resolution, and if this is passed and signed, a debt ceiling conversation all coming together roughly later on this spring?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will not negotiate over Congress\' responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has already incurred.\xc2\xa0 That is true today.\xc2\xa0 It will be true in three months. It will be true for as long as he is President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He has always indicated his interest in and desire to work with, engage with, and negotiate with Congress over how we continue to reduce our deficit in a responsible balanced way, and he will do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I take, and the President takes some of the statements by Republican leaders and important and prominent Republicans about the absolute folly of pursuing a strategy that ties raising the debt ceiling to demands on spending cuts, the fact that it is folly -- we take heart in that because we believe it\'s good for the economy to cease that practice.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to engage in it any more in three months than we were going to engage in it now.\xc2\xa0 But we will work with Congress on moving forward with balanced deficit reduction because it\'s important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on the other questions -- do you reject some of the characterizations of the speech as different in tone, different in substance from what the President has said before?\xc2\xa0 There are those who are describing it as a "more forceful and more confident embrace of the President\'s underlying liberal approaches to politics."\xc2\xa0 Many described his speech that way.\xc2\xa0 You would reject that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that it was forceful.\xc2\xa0 I would say that it was confident.\xc2\xa0 And it was confident not in the sense of self-confidence, but confident about the potential that America has at this moment if we seize the moment and work together.</p>\n<p>I would reject the idea that this was an "ism" speech.\xc2\xa0 This was in fact the opposite of that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it is tied I think very clearly to the speech that the President, then Senate candidate, gave in 2004 in Boston, and is linked to so many other major addresses that he\xe2\x80\x99s given, which is he focuses on the fact that we are Americans first.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I hardly think that pursuit of equal rights, pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform, pursuit of sensible policies that deal with climate change and enhance our energy independence are ideological.\xc2\xa0 The only \xe2\x80\x9cism\xe2\x80\x9d that was a part of that speech was his rejection of absolutism.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure it was confident and it was forceful because he believes we have to act. We have to come together and act.\xc2\xa0 We have responsibilities that we need to act on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not on behalf of liberalism or progressivism?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on behalf of ideas that represent who we are as Americans.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I would reject the idea that pursuit of equal rights is a Democratic-only pursuit.\xc2\xa0 Or pursuit of energy legislation that enhances our independence, increases our production of domestic forms of energy and addresses climate change is only a province of liberalism or the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I would hope -- I know that Republicans would reject that, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is his vision for how we can move together forward. And one of the things he made clear is we can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to resolve all our differences before we act because those differences that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for generations about the role of government and the balance between what we do to assist our citizens -- senior citizens and others, versus what we collect in revenue -- those debates will continue and we can have them, but we should not allow them to become an excuse for inaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you told John, don\xe2\x80\x99t break up the speech into pieces, the White House itself was breaking it up into pieces.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday afternoon I got an e-mail about gay rights -- here\xe2\x80\x99s what the President said on that issue, here\xe2\x80\x99s a link to it, he\xe2\x80\x99s moving forward on this.\xc2\xa0 You did that with specific issues.\xc2\xa0 So my question is you broke up the speech into pieces, told your supporters, hey, he\xe2\x80\x99s pushing on these things, but now it sounds like today you\xe2\x80\x99re saying on climate change you don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait, Ed, first of all --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you going to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will build on, when it comes to climate change, the progress that was achieved in his first term. And he looks forward to doing that on behalf of the economy, on behalf of the environment.\xc2\xa0 He will build on the progress that was made in achieving equality for LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that is not a proposition that should be -- that he believes will be embraced only by one political party or faction of the country, because there is a link here between the March on Washington and Seneca Falls and Stonewall.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are -- the pursuit of equal rights is one that Democrats and Republicans have worked on together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Major said cap and trade, and you said, well, he wants legislation.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t say -- so he does still support cap and trade, or no?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 But we -- he put forward and worked on legislation that did not succeed in Congress because of the opposition that exists there.\xc2\xa0 And we are mindful of the fact that opposition exists there.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\'t mean -- going back to the sort of overall premise of his speech -- that we can\'t or shouldn\'t continue to make progress to deal with what is an important issue and a priority of his.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you said the speech is confident, he wants action -- so then, why when he talked about entitlements did he only say essentially we need to protect these programs and make sure they\'re there?\xc2\xa0 Where was the call for sacrifice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the call for sacrifice has been evident in the proposals the President has put forward on how we achieve deficit reduction in a balanced way, in a way that represents real compromise.\xc2\xa0 And he made clear it is important to continue to reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 And I think anybody who has been in this room for the past couple of years knows that this is an issue that has enjoyed the focus of the President\'s attention quite a bit and will continue to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it is not the only priority that he has.\xc2\xa0 We need to, we must, because of the challenges we face, act on a series of priorities.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to work with Congress to achieve balanced deficit reduction in a way that ensures that we don\'t ask seniors and families with disabled children, or families struggling to send their kids to college to bear all the burden, but that we do this together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s been the approach he\'s taken.\xc2\xa0 That was the approach that he insisted on that led to significant achievement at the end of the year -- or the beginning of this year with the fiscal cliff deal that ensured that millionaires and billionaires will be again paying income tax rates at the level that they paid under Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And we need to move forward and continue to do this in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing -- a counterterrorism playbook.\xc2\xa0 I think The Washington Post reported over the weekend the administration is working on rules for counterterrorism moving forward in the days ahead.\xc2\xa0 I understand obviously pieces of that may be of a classified nature that you can\'t talk about.\xc2\xa0 But generally speaking, can you give us an update on where\'s the administration on kind of rewriting this playbook?\xc2\xa0 And specifically, there\'s an allegation out there that you\'re going to give drone strikes a pass.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to comment.\xc2\xa0 I will point you to statements that John Brennan and others have made about this.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s overall approach is that we need to do everything we can to keep Americans and America safe, as well as our allies, and we need to do it in ways that are consistent with our values and our laws.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly the approach that he has taken and will continue to take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this coming out soon, in days, weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware there\xe2\x80\x99s a playbook that we\'re going to publish.\xc2\xa0 But I would have to point you again to statements by John Brennan and others.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, also yesterday during his inaugural address, the President said "our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law." In the past, the President has said that same-sex marriage is an issue that should be worked out at the state level.\xc2\xa0 Does this suggest that he now believes it\'s something that should be worked out at the federal level?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\'s position on this has been clear in terms of his personal views.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that individuals who love each other should not be barred from marriage.\xc2\xa0 And he talks about this in a -- not about religious sacraments, but civil marriage.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to inform his beliefs.</p>\n<p>We have taken positions on various efforts to restrict the rights of Americans, which he generally thinks is a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 And you know his position on Section 3 of DOMA.\xc2\xa0 But the overall principle that we should not discriminate or treat differently LGBT Americans is one he believes in deeply.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it something that should be litigated at the federal level?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the reasons why we believe that DOMA, the Section 3 of DOMA is not constitutional is because we should not be addressing it in that way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about Proposition 8?\xc2\xa0 Will he now begin to actively oppose Proposition 8, which the Supreme Court is set to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the administration is not party to that case.\xc2\xa0 And I have nothing more for you on it.\xc2\xa0 We have, as you know, through the Department of Justice taken an active role in DOMA cases, which is why I can tell you the things I\'ve told you about that.\xc2\xa0 But on the Section 8 case, we\'re not involved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, just on Algeria -- the Britons and other nations have criticized Algeria\'s response, calling it "harsh," "hasty."\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that view?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that lives could have been saved if this was handled differently?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, I\'d like to say that the President extends his deepest condolences to the families of Victor Lovelady, Gordon Rowan, and Frederick Buttaccio, and all of those who were killed and injured in the terrorist attack in Algeria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists who carried it out.\xc2\xa0 And the United States condemns their actions in the strongest possible terms.\xc2\xa0 This attack is another reminder of the threat posed by al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups in North Africa.\xc2\xa0 We will remain vigilant against that threat, and we\'ll continue to work closely with all of our partners in the region to combat it.\xc2\xa0 We will remain in close touch with the government of Algeria to gain a fuller understanding of what took place, so that we can work together to prevent tragedies like this in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let\'s be clear in terms of the specific question that you had.\xc2\xa0 The blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists who carried it out, and the United States condemns those actions in the strongest possible terms.</p>\n<p>The Algerians have said, as you know, that these attackers intended to kill all of the hostages and blow up the facility.\xc2\xa0 Now, obviously, that outcome would have made the situation even more tragic.\xc2\xa0 But we are in touch with, as we have been -- we\'ll continue to be in touch with the government of Algeria to gain a fuller picture of what happened.\xc2\xa0 But we cannot lose sight of the fact that the blame for this lies with the terrorists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President talked yesterday about the drought and fires and severe storms.\xc2\xa0 And I wondered, does he think that\'s changing the political climate in a way that creates an opening for legislative action maybe now that wasn\'t there a few years ago?\xc2\xa0 Or is he really just putting his eggs in the administrative action basket?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to go -- I appreciate the interest in this issue, one that the President shares.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to preview or speculate about actions beyond what I\'ve said already.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that climate change is real.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly a conviction held by most Americans, and certainly backed up by the vast majority of the science.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>No specific storm or weather event can be tied to climate change, but the fact is we have seen more severe storms.\xc2\xa0 We have seen more severe weather events, droughts, and fires.\xc2\xa0 And as we are experiencing -- or certainly, the people of New Jersey and New York especially are experiencing -- the impacts of those storms are devastating.\xc2\xa0 The impacts of those events can be devastating.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s all the more reason for us to act together.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\'m having a hard time thinking about the counterterrorism strategy, particularly with drone strikes and the President\'s comments yesterday about, "We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war."\xc2\xa0 At a time when troops are coming home from Afghanistan, drone strike are intensifying, which feels like that is leading -- is there an end to that, in other words, or is that -- does he not see a drone strike as an act of war?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will continue to pursue a strategy that protects the country, protects the American people, protects our men and women overseas, and do so in a way that is consistent with our values.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that after more than a decade of war, we are entering a new phase, we are entering a new time in our effort to combat al Qaeda and its affiliates and like-minded extremists who threaten the United States, threaten our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President is very clear-eyed and understanding of the fact that that threat remains.\xc2\xa0 Even as we have done great damage to al Qaeda central, to the core al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, we are dealing with al Qaeda affiliates in different parts of the region and the world, and we will continue to have to deal with them, working with our partners to make sure that those threats are contained and that we continue the President\'s overarching goal, when it comes to al Qaeda, which is its disruption, dismantlement, and ultimate defeat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\'s made great progress, the administration has made great progress, thanks to the remarkable work of our armed services, the remarkable work of our intelligence services.\xc2\xa0 But that effort is not done, and we cannot be anything but vigilant in pursuit of that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other.\xc2\xa0 Israelis vote today, and it looks like the government that will emerge -- some of the key components of the coalition will be opposed to any talks with Palestinians, any talks -- the idea of the two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the administration\'s strategy to engage a government like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we don\'t want to get ahead of election results.\xc2\xa0 Israel is a vibrant democracy, and we look forward to learning the results of that election when they are available.\xc2\xa0 And we have to wait and see the make-up of the next Israeli government, and how it approaches long-standing critical issues, including the one that you talked about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States remains committed, as it has been for a long time, to working with the parties to press for the goal of a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 That has not changed and it will not change. We will continue to make clear that only through direct negotiations between the parties can the Palestinians and Israelis address all the permanent status issues that need to be addressed, and achieve the peace that they both deserve:\xc2\xa0 two states for two peoples with a sovereign, viable and independent Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with a Jewish and democratic Israel.</p>\n<p>We also continue to believe that unilateral action by either side does not help the cause of reaching a peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we have made that clear to both sides, whether it\'s settlement activity or unilateral actions at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 We make our view very clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In long-term planning on this issue, which the President has cared about in the first term, do you think about the possibility that in this term, that framework that began in the early \'90s may collapse, and how to manage it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is a challenge and always has been for U.S. Presidents and administrations, and for everyone in the world, each country that has been engaged in this process in trying to help bring about a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If it were easy, obviously it would have been achieved.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to continuing to work with both parties, continuing to encourage both parties to engage in direct negotiations, to help bring about resolution of the permanent status issues that can allow for the outcome that I just described.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there is no question that it\'s hard work, and for that reason alone I would refrain from predicting success over the next four years.\xc2\xa0 I think we will simply continue to work on it.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, yesterday, how was the President -- how and when was the President briefed on the Algerian hostage situation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was updated on it throughout the last several days.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific mode of how he was updated on it by his national security team, but he has been very on top of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But during the inauguration ceremonies or if anything, was he ever pulled aside?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that for you.\xc2\xa0 As you know, wherever he goes he travels with a national security official.\xc2\xa0 He\'s obviously in constant communication with his national security team on matters like this and other matters.\xc2\xa0 And he was regularly updated on the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there wasn\'t any particular moment yesterday where he was told Americans had died?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, not that I have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that level of specificity for you.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that he was updated regularly on the events, as he has been and had been over the previous several days going into late last week, and updated on both what we knew and on various reports that were conflicting.\xc2\xa0 And this was a process that played out over a number of days and obviously ended in a tragic result, and he was updated all along.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, related to the other question about Israel, I know you\'re not going to read out any travel plans at this point, but can you talk about the priorities for the President in terms of international travel as he begins his second term?\xc2\xa0 For example, would a visit to Israel and Palestinian territories be in that list?\xc2\xa0 A visit to Moscow for talks with Putin, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling plans to announce or priorities to put forward.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to travel, as he did during his first term, continuing to pursue the development and deepening of our important multilateral and bilateral relationships around the world.\xc2\xa0 He will participate in various summits and conferences as he has in his first term, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific travel announcements to make.</p>\n<p>I think Reid, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Kristen\'s question earlier, does the President believe that gay marriage should be a state issue or a federal issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I addressed that.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it\'s an issue that should be addressed by the states.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and I can make it clear, that the President\'s personal view is that it\'s wrong to prevent couples who are in loving, committed relationships and want to marry from doing so.\xc2\xa0 The values that the President cares most deeply about are how we treat one another and respect one another.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For him, it just boils down to treating others the way that we would want to be treated ourselves.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made it absolutely clear that his views are about civil marriage, as I said, not religious sacraments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Victoria, and then -- well, Victoria, and then we\'ll see.\xc2\xa0 Maybe Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how confident are you that U.S. intelligence isn\'t lagging behind events on the ground in Algeria with the recent siege and in Mali with the coup by U.S.-trained junior officers -- and in other countries in that region?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that we have confidence in our intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the siege in Algeria was of a private British petroleum facility.\xc2\xa0 It was not a government facility, a U.S. facility.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with France and support their effort in Mali, and believe that the goal of preventing terrorists a safe haven is an important one as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about.</p>\n<p>Yes, in the back, in the purple shirt.\xc2\xa0 Identify yourself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeffrey Cunningham, Saudi Press.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you, too.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In the second term, does the President plan on addressing his first campaign promise to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President remains committed to that.\xc2\xa0 He agrees with military leaders as well as his immediate predecessor that we ought to do that.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously obstacles in Congress to that, but we will continue to work towards that goal because he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of our national security.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did say Cheryl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Friday on your debt limit statement, you urged Congress to pass a clean debt limit increase.\xc2\xa0 Did you have a specific concern that you used that language?\xc2\xa0 And also, do you think that the Senate should be required to pass a budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Senate leaders -- Democratic leaders have addressed this question and have said that they intend to move forward with a budget.\xc2\xa0 Having said that, I would note, as I have in the past, that anyone who believes that the stalemates and confrontations we\xe2\x80\x99ve had over fiscal and budget policy over the last couple of years have been because of the Senate action on the budget I think misunderstand the situation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has been very clear about his budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward specific and detailed budgets.\xc2\xa0 He has engaged with Republican leaders to try to achieve bipartisan compromise resolutions that reduce our deficit in a balanced and fair way, and he will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 So I would point you to what the Senate said -- Senate leaders have said about their intentions.</p>\n<p>In terms of clean, we simply -- I think that reiterates the point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making all along that we won\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate -- we won\xe2\x80\x99t allow the American economy, the American people be held hostage over whether or not the Congress is going to -- in this case, the Republicans are going to allow the debt ceiling to be raised because it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly damaging.</p>\n<p>And you can\'t -- again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve hopefully crossed this bridge, at least for now, which is a welcomed thing, and I think welcomed by the business community; welcomed by middle-class Americans, regular folks; welcomed by the global economy and the markets.\xc2\xa0 And that can only be to the good.</p>\n<p>Thanks, all.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:27 P.M.
