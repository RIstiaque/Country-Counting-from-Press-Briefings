Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t11:18 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 I just want to do one quick thing at the top before we go to questions, and this is just in response to a number of questions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve received over the last couple of weeks about the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are aware that Iran has made important progress in fulfilling the obligations and commitments that they made in the context of that international agreement to dismantle significant portions of their nuclear infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 There are important steps that they have committed to take, and they will not be receiving any sort of sanctions relief until the IAEA has been able to independently verify that those steps have been completed and the IAEA also, moving forward, will preserve significant capability to monitor Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just as a quick reminder, it seems useful to walk through very briefly the steps that Iran has committed to take before any sanctions relief will be provided.\xc2\xa0 This includes essentially -- or completely shutting down every pathway that Iran has to acquiring enough fissile material to develop a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That meant that Iran had to follow through with a commitment to eliminate 98 percent of their uranium stockpile.\xc2\xa0 We do actually know that this is one element of their commitments that they did fulfill -- they shipped 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of the country over the holidays.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They also made a commitment to stop spinning thousands of centrifuges, and to remove and to place into storage 13,000 of those centrifuges.\xc2\xa0 And those storage facilities will also be monitored by the IAEA to ensure that they remain there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, most importantly, there will be ongoing monitoring by the IAEA of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s critical because we do have the ability if we detect that Iran is not fulfilling all of their commitments that we can snap sanctions back into place.\xc2\xa0 And that is written into the agreement, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on timing -- I think that is a key question, and there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously understandable interest in that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on timing.\xc2\xa0 But we know that Iran is making important progress.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the limiting factors here are both Iran\xe2\x80\x99s completion of these tasks, and the ability of the IAEA to independently verify that those tasks have been completed.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially what remains to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And all of it underscores the significance of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And obviously critics of the agreement and critics of the administration note that Iran will get sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 The amount of that sanctions relief is often exaggerated by the critics.\xc2\xa0 But somehow they fail to acknowledge that when President Obama took office, the world was quite concerned that Iran was racing to enhance their military -- or enhance their nuclear capacity so that they could build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, because of the tough and principled diplomacy that was advanced by President Obama, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen Iran dismantle so much of their nuclear architecture that we have blocked every pathway they have to building a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial accomplishment.\xc2\xa0 It certainly makes the world safer.\xc2\xa0 It strengthens the security of our closest allies around the world, particularly Israel.\xc2\xa0 And it enhances the national security of the United States, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President pursued it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Question on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9ctiming,\xe2\x80\x9d do you mean waiting for the IAEA to issue a statement of verification?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting on; that we are both waiting for Iran to complete the steps that they said that they would take, and for the IAEA to independently verify that those steps have been completed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important not to separate those two things because it may, in fact, be, Mark, that they have completed all of the steps that they need to take, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take their word for it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to make sure that we have independent verification by nuclear experts.\xc2\xa0 So we see those two things -- they\xe2\x80\x99re two steps, but we see them as inextricably linked, primarily because we\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to take the Iranians\xe2\x80\x99 word for it if they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve -- that they have taken the steps that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to take.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that makes it sound like the IAEA is what you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to leave you with that impression because it may be that Iran hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken actually the steps that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to take.\xc2\xa0 So these are just inextricably linked. But I think the leadership in Iran has made quite clear that they are working aggressively to fulfill their end of the bargain.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the zeal with which they are pursuing the fulfillment of their commitments.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, Mark, we also want to make sure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t cut any corners. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why independent verification has been in some ways the key part of this agreement from the beginning because there is, based on their history, a lot of distrust about the way that Iran talked publicly about their nuclear program in particular.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, they are two steps, but they are inextricably linked.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron, did you have something on this, too?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 You said that the amount of sanctions relief that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get is often exaggerated.\xc2\xa0 What is the accurate amount, or how would you describe what they are getting currently?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my colleagues at the Treasury Department can give you a little bit more detail on this.\xc2\xa0 The number that is often cited by critics of the deal is $150 billion, and our experts have indicated that that is, like I said, an exaggeration.\xc2\xa0 The number that I have heard is that it\xe2\x80\x99s closer to $50 billion or $100 billion, not $150 billion.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is, in part, that Iran has a lot of bills that have come due, and so much of the sanctions relief that they will receive will immediately be devoted to paying off debts that they have incurred.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is that the sanctions relief that they receive will merely allow them to get access to their own money that is currently in the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there\xe2\x80\x99s an impact on the taxpayers of the United States here.\xc2\xa0 These are essentially sanctions that were designed by the United States, enforced by the world, to essentially limit or outright prevent Iran\xe2\x80\x99s access to their own money that was in the international system.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re getting the growth on that money.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re getting the growth on that money as well, plus debts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that Iran is not getting anything.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just suggesting that they\xe2\x80\x99re not getting any financial resources from the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s their own money.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth being accurate about what the amount of money that is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not $150 billion.\xc2\xa0 For a more precise calculation I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that I wanted to go through this exercise is it\xe2\x80\x99s often described by our critics as what Iran is getting, but they fail to note what the international community is getting and what the United States is getting, and what impact that has on our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting is verifiable confirmation that Iran won\xe2\x80\x99t have a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And as recently as five or six years ago, there was a real concern about what would happen to Israel and to our security interests in the Middle East because of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive pursuit of a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago -- a year ago -- that the assessment of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 intelligence community that Iran was within three months -- that essentially they had a three-month breakout period.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we know that once this deal goes through and hopefully that will be soon, that breakout period will be extended to a year.\xc2\xa0 And because of our verification measures, we\xe2\x80\x99ll know right away once they have begun to take those steps.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, the benefits for the United States, for Israel, for our other allies and partners in the region when it comes to our national security are significant, despite the fact they are often overlooked by our critics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Israel.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any -- have there been any discussions, or is there a strategy to talk to Israel? Are there discussions going on as this becomes more imminent?\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s that task force examining the overall aid package.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there something specific going on with the Israelis to reassure them now as we approach this implementation day?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you touched on the main part of that, which is the work that is ongoing between senior officials here in the United States and senior national security officials in Israel to discuss the extension and expansion of the memorandum of understanding about U.S. military support to Israel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President has talked about how the commitment on the part of the United States to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security is unshakeable.\xc2\xa0 And Prime Minister Netanyahu has himself observed that kind of assistance that\'s been provided by the United States under the leadership of President Barack Obama to Israel has been unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re seeking to further extend and deepen that kind of coordination and cooperation in the context of these discussions.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that they\'re working on hard, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go back to Darlene.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to skip Darlene, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The governor of Michigan has asked President Obama to issue an emergency disaster declaration over the crisis with lead in the drinking water in Flint.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of how quickly the administration expects to make a decision on that request?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a formal process at FEMA for considering these kinds of requests.\xc2\xa0 That process is ongoing, and given the nature of the kinds of requests that are made in that system, those requests are considered expeditiously.\xc2\xa0 Just a matter of course, this one will be as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, Darlene, there are already a number of things that the federal government has done to respond to this ongoing situation.\xc2\xa0 There actually already are FEMA personnel that have been deployed to Flint to serve as a liaison between the long-term recovery committee that was established by the governor and the relevant federal agencies that may be able to assist with existing programs and funds.\xc2\xa0 There also was FEMA staff that was deployed to Michigan to provide some logistical and technical support to the state and local officials who are on the ground responding to the situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also know that there has been some physical supplies that have been provided by FEMA to the state of Michigan to respond to this situation, specifically bottled water.\xc2\xa0 FEMA has a regular process where they stockpile commodities for use in responding to emergency situations.\xc2\xa0 And just as a matter of course, what FEMA will do is that when those commodities get close to their expiration date, they often will donate those resources to charity.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, they had bottled water that was nearing its expiration date that they were prepared to donate to charity that has been redirected to this ongoing response effort in Michigan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of resources that have already been dedicated by the federal government to assist state and local officials who are responding to this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I didn\'t mention is that both the EPA and the Department of Justice have indicated that they\'re taking a close look at this situation in terms of the science and in terms of the impact that it has had and could have on local populations.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice is obviously taking a look at the decisions that led to this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that\'s already going on in Flint.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the governor has made a request through the formal process, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a request that we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider expeditiously.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a chance there could be a decision as early as this weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The potential for that certainly exists.\xc2\xa0 For an update on the timing, I\xe2\x80\x99d actually refer you to FEMA.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, to follow up on the terrorist attack in Indonesia the other day, what does it say about the strength of the Islamic State that they\xe2\x80\x99ve now carried a terrorist in Indonesia, which is kind of far away from some of the other places they have carried out similar attacks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of concerns when it relates to the ability of ISIL to spread their violence, mayhem and murderous ideology.\xc2\xa0 The first is concern about foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who have traveled from around the globe to Iraq and Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The concern obviously is that these individuals could use their foreign passports to return to their home country and organize and carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial number of individuals from Indonesia who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And so the threat that is posed by foreign fighters is significant, one the Indonesians are keenly aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is also a concern that the President himself is keenly aware of.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why, almost a year and a half ago now, the President convened a meeting of the National Security Council -- or the United Nations Security Council to discuss how the international community could coordinate our efforts to combat foreign fighters, to share intelligence, to share information about individuals who are traveling.\xc2\xa0 And that has enhanced the security of nations around the world.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there is more that we can do when it comes to information sharing to try to combat this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second source of concern, Darlene, is actually a concern that is acutely held here in the United States, too, which is the way in which ISIL has capitalized on social media to spread their ideology and to try to radicalize vulnerable individuals.\xc2\xa0 And so there obviously is an effort -- an aggressive effort that we have mounted both here in the United States and around the world to try to combat their online radicalization efforts.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, when the President was in Southeast Asia -- he was in Malaysia -- he talked about how the United States was supporting the Malaysians as they established a regional fusion center that could be used to coordinate the effort to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s online radicalization attempts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are a variety of ways in which we are supporting the Indonesians as they counter this threat.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to leave you with the impression that we know exactly at this point -- or at least that we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to talk publicly at this point about who carried out the heinous attacks that you referred to or how they were able to carry out those attacks.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s still under investigation by the Indonesians, and we have offered our support to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned yesterday, it certainly bears repeating that our thoughts and prayers continue to be with those Indonesians who were affected by this terrible act of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there\xe2\x80\x99s another big selloff on Wall Street today. How closely is the White House tracking this?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about it, and is it any signal of maybe some other problems with the economy despite the President\xe2\x80\x99s optimism that he expressed earlier this week at State of the Union?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I\xe2\x80\x99m always reluctant to talk about day-to-day movements in the stock market.\xc2\xa0 That reluctance continues today.\xc2\xa0 I would note that most of the market indexes, indices, closed somewhat higher yesterday, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re down again today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, these are market movements that are closely watched at the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 They watch financial markets all around the world and are carefully evaluating what sort of impact they could have on the broader economy here in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has been briefed on today\xe2\x80\x99s movements at all, but I think they highlight -- I guess there are three things that come to mind.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first is, there are a lot of other data points to indicate the strength and durability of the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 We just got jobs numbers one week ago today that showed at the end of last year that 292,000 jobs were created just in December of 2015, and that was the continuation of the longest streak of private sector job growth in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history -- 70 months now, north of 14 million jobs created over that period of time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the U.S. economy continues to be quite durable despite -- and this is the second point I wanted to make -- despite the kind of volatility that we see overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that weakness in other markets with whom we do extensive business is going to be a headwind for the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that.\xc2\xa0 Particularly as the international economy becomes more integrated, we have to be sensitive to movements that we see in the economies of other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President continued to aggressively advocate in his State of the Union for additional policies here in the United States that would allow us to build on the momentum that we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing in the job market, but also allow us to strengthen the U.S. economy particularly for middle-class families that could be vulnerable to some of the effects that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing from weaknesses in other countries\xe2\x80\x99 economies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has championed nearer-term solutions, like investments in infrastructure and raising the minimum wage, but also encouraging Congress to take the kinds of steps now that will position our economy over the long term to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And these are investments in early childhood education and other policies that would open the door to a college education to more students and workers and their families.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has obviously got a lot of ideas.\xc2\xa0 And I think that even some of those who are concerned about the impact of the market volatility today on the U.S. economy should join the President in thinking over the long term about what we can do to better prepare the country to withstand that kind of volatility in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, following up on Michigan, did the EPA drop the ball on this issue?\xc2\xa0 This is something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been aware of.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill their duties on this apparent crisis in Michigan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite limited in what I can say about attributing any sort of blame for this particular situation, primarily because the Department of Justice is taking a look at this question.\xc2\xa0 The EPA has obviously been involved, and they\xe2\x80\x99re involved now in trying to respond to the situation.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of who could be to blame, what actions state officials took both before this incident and its immediate aftermath are questions that ultimately are being investigated and will have to be answered by the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on the Iran deal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the IAEA issues this report and the member states look at it, Secretary of State Kerry will review, sign off, and that triggers the process for sanctions being lifted.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to read this IAEA report or be briefed on it before that happens?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that the President will get a briefing on the findings, but I also would not anticipate that the need to review the IAEA report would lead to a significant delay in moving forward.\xc2\xa0 Part of that\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99re in ongoing communications with the IAEA about their work, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely there will be any surprises, which I think would allow us to review that report without any significant delay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could do this all in one day, a matter of hours?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of what the timing would look like or how quickly we could turn it around.\xc2\xa0 My colleagues at the State Department may be able to give you a better assessment of that.\xc2\xa0 But I would not anticipate a lengthy delay once a final IAEA report has been issued, primarily because we continue to be in regular communication with them about their ongoing review.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when you heard from the Secretary of State this week, he stood up at a podium and said Iran poured concrete into their reactor at Arak.\xc2\xa0 We had a press release saying they\xe2\x80\x99d shipped out uranium.\xc2\xa0 It seems the U.S. is independently verifying some of these things.\xc2\xa0 So I know that technically we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting on this IAEA report, but, frankly, it seems that the U.S. is saying we are full speed ahead, going ahead with this deal, regardless of that IAEA report -- that\xe2\x80\x99s just a technicality.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I assure you that when this agreement was being negotiated, the important, independent work of the IAEA was considered to be much more than a technicality.\xc2\xa0 As I noted earlier, getting the IAEA access to the information that they need to verify the initial steps that Iran is taking and be positioned and have the access they need to verify their compliance with the agreement on an ongoing basis was a critical part of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And primarily that\xe2\x80\x99s because there\xe2\x80\x99s ample reason to distrust what Iran says about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Their track record on this is less than stellar.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And rather than be in a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99re quibbling with them about what we assess and what they claim to have done, we have basically created a system that will allow independent, international nuclear experts significant access into Iran and their nuclear program to verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that was a critical part of these negotiations, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to rely on those international experts moving forward to ensure that Iran is living up to their commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you had not only the incident with the sailors this week -- it was quickly resolved -- but you also have Iran testing ballistic missiles in the past few months and, as you continue to note, Iran meddling elsewhere in the world.\xc2\xa0 So when you hear from the administration implementation day is just days away, it seems like a sure thing, it seems like no matter what misbehavior you see with Iran right now, this deal is on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been quite clear from the very beginning -- long before a deal was even reached -- that the negotiations were focused primarily on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That was our number one concern.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also the number one concern of our allies in Israel, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason that the United States, Israel, and the broader international community was concerned about the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon is that in so many other areas Iran is a pretty bad actor.\xc2\xa0 Iran supports terrorism.\xc2\xa0 Iran has an aggressive ballistic missile program that is under development.\xc2\xa0 Iran regularly menaces Israel.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the kind of country you want to be sure doesn\'t have access to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we made it a priority.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why our international partners made it a priority -- that includes the U.K., France, Germany, China, and Russia.\xc2\xa0 They all made that their priority.\xc2\xa0 And we have succeeded -- or hopefully will soon succeed in verifying that Iran has taken the necessary steps to block every path they have to developing that nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t eliminate the long list of concerns we have with their other behavior, but I think it does help explain why we\xe2\x80\x99ve made preventing them from getting a nuclear weapon a top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there are a variety of ways that we\'re going to continue to impress upon the Iranians the need to address our other concerns, as well.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about the fact that Iran is potentially subject to significant sanctions as a result of the ballistic missile testing that has been reported. So we\'re going to continue to apply pressure to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron mentioned the enhanced support that we\'re going to provide to our allies in the region, and that includes the Israelis, but also our partners like Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think the other thing that is notable from all of this is that the diplomatic engagement that has brought us quite close to this international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon is also helping the United States in other ways.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because of that established diplomatic channel that we were able to promptly resolve the situation of the U.S. sailors that ended up in Iranian territorial waters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- incentive of sanctions relief just days away.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me explain why I brought this up.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot, again, of our critics who suggested rather rash and irresponsible reactions to this situation.\xc2\xa0 One U.S. senator suggested that the United States should delay the State of Union address.\xc2\xa0 There was one U.S. senator who was on television last night who was apparently suggesting that in response to the situation the President of the United States should have bombed or invaded Iran or both.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me exactly how either of those proposed responses would have resulted in a better outcome, because the outcome, as we all saw, was that these sailors, 14 hours after they were picked up in Iranian waters, were released unharmed with their boats.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I do think that the kind of diplomatic engagement that the President has aggressively pursued in the face of blistering criticism from our critics has I think quite clearly shown how it advances our national security interests to pursue the approach that the President has.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it is difficult for our critics to make an argument otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you mentioned that Iran could be sanctioned for its ballistic missile testing.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the U.S. can now sanction Iran for testing ballistic missiles once this deal goes through?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have never taken off the table the ability of the United States to impose sanctions on Iran based on our other concerns about their behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve delayed that action?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there has been significant discussion about the possibility that the United States could impose sanctions on Iran over their ballistic missile program.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that that\'s something that could be imposed here at any time.\xc2\xa0 So that has always been an option on the table.\xc2\xa0 And we talked about how the nuclear agreement would not resolve the long list of concerns that we have about their ballistic missile program or about their human rights record or about their menacing of Israel.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been clear that this nuclear agreement did not in any way impair our ability to hold Iran accountable for those kinds of nefarious activities, either.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, once this is -- the technicalities of all this are done, would you anticipate that the President might call President Rohani and perhaps personally ask for the return of the five American civilians -- at least five Americans who are still held in Tehran?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any presidential phone calls to preview for you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any current plans for the President to telephone his Iranian counterpart.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it relates to those Americans who are currently and unjustly held by Iran, we have -- in the context of these nuclear negotiations, Secretary Kerry made clear that every time he met with his counterpart to discuss their nuclear program, he also made it a point to raise our ongoing concerns about these Americans who are being unjustly detained.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that we have made this a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about how this issue is quite personal to him.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you of our ongoing efforts to secure their release, but we certainly believe strongly, and have made it a priority, to tell the Iranians that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready for our American citizens who are being unjustly detained in Iran to be released.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, in short, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the U.S. loses leverage on Iran to get the American civilians back by giving the sanctions relief and taking the pressure off of its economy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is our view that these are -- we have always made clear that we would not -- and it would not be in the best interest of those unjustly detained Americans to make their cases somehow contingent on this nuclear agreement.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make it easier for us to get them -- to bring them home. We continue to have -- to make a strong case to the Iranians that these Americans are being unjustly detained in their country and that they should be released.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s a priority.\xc2\xa0 And it will continue to be until they\xe2\x80\x99re brought home.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday night at the Republican debate, as usual, the President was attacked several times on foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Did he watch the debate?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s his reaction to those candidates saying America is a mess and does not have any more influence all over the world?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, I did watch part of the debate last night.\xc2\xa0 I regretted it deeply.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President made that same mistake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for a response or a rebuttal, the President had the opportunity on Tuesday night to address the nation, where he delivered his fundamentally optimistic and confident view about how the United States is the greatest country in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have the most stable and durable economy of any nation in the world.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have the greatest fighting force of any nation in the world.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to have the capacity to advance our interests around the world.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re using them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you annoyed by those critics during the Republican debate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, primarily because we hear a lot of overheated rhetoric but not a lot of facts to substantiate it.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that was notable about last night for me is I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d pine for the days of Herman Cain, but at least he had a 9-9-9 plan.\xc2\xa0 It was outrageous, but at least he had an affirmative governing proposal and agenda.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anybody with even a semblance of a 9-9-9 plan.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I mean, next to all these guys that were on the stage last night, Herman Cain looks like a policy wonk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the reason that that is disappointing is the President is working hard to implement a forward-looking agenda that is going to expand economic opportunity for the middle class, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to make America safer around the world.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress just in the last few months with members of Congress reaching the kinds of legislative agreements that are going to advance that agenda.\xc2\xa0 We reformed No Child Left Behind in a way that will improve our education system and not subject our students to too much testing.\xc2\xa0 We passed a five-year transportation bill that will allow us to at least, over the long term, lock in some level of infrastructure funding.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we need to increase that level of funding, but at least locking in that five-year guarantee will allow state and local governments across the country to invest in the kind of infrastructure projects that are good for our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are other things, right, that we -- we made permanent tax cuts for middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We reached a budget agreement that would allow us to adequately fund our economic and national security priorities $50 billion over the sequester levels that were advocated by a bunch of Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has an affirmative agenda, and we are actually having success in advancing it, despite the kind of opposition we see from the Republicans who are actually in the majority of both houses of Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what leadership is, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people expect out of their President.\xc2\xa0 And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything close to that on the stage last night.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction about the Donald Trump comments on 9/11?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually see that part of the debate that he delivered it, but I obviously read about his remarks.\xc2\xa0 Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that people all across the country and around the world were inspired by the response of the people of New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doug.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration at all troubled or embarrassed that Iran is using these images and video of these soldiers with blindfolds -- sailors with blindfolds on, or on their knees with their hands behind their back, for propaganda purposes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Doug, primarily what we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about when it came to our soldiers is making sure that they were released promptly and unharmed.\xc2\xa0 And all of that happened within 14 hours of their originally being taken into Iranian custody when they drifted into Iranian territorial waters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And were you troubled or embarrassed by Iran using these photos?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason for anybody to be embarrassed.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s reason for us to be certainly relieved that our servicemen and women who are protecting America in a very dangerous part of the world were released very -- pretty shortly after they were taken into custody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the rules are engagement that these sailors in these boats were operating under in the Persian Gulf?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense could give you a better sense of the kind of instructions that they were given before their mission began.\xc2\xa0 What the Secretary of Defense has said is that they erroneously ended up in Iranian territorial waters.\xc2\xa0 The circumstances that led them to this particular situation are still being investigated by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s conducting interviews with the soldiers who were involved, so there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we\xe2\x80\x99ll learn about the particular situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of cryptic blocking of information coming out.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been well over 24 hours now; we have instant communication. These soldiers have been interrogated by their superiors.\xc2\xa0 Presumably either the Pentagon or the White House would know precisely what went on.\xc2\xa0 Yet so many -- there are so many gaps.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we had a senior Pentagon official tell us yesterday that the administration is blocking the facts from getting out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty transparent about this.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been transparent about the fact that if we had followed the advice of some of the Republican critics of the administration, we\xe2\x80\x99d probably be in a bloody war with Iran right now over our sailors.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact is our sailors right now are out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 Their boats were released and there was no loss of life.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me, by the way, exactly how the safety and security of the United States or our men and women in uniform is advanced by starting a war with a nation like Iran that has an advanced military.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These sailors are part of the Fifth Fleet.\xc2\xa0 If their instructions are to do nothing -- and from all appearances, they were apprehended by much smaller boats, much less armed boats -- and we understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a state of war with Iran, which, again, raises questions about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior -- blindfolding these guys and holding them at gunpoint -- but they\xe2\x80\x99re members of the Fifth Fleet.\xc2\xa0 Is the Fifth Fleet under instructions to do nothing in the event of something like this happening?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the Fifth Fleet.\xc2\xa0 I feel pretty confident in telling you they didn\xe2\x80\x99t just do nothing.\xc2\xa0 But you can go ask them exactly what their response was.\xc2\xa0 Whatever it was, it was consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy that led to the prompt and safe return of those sailors about 14 hours after they were originally taken into custody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 JC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Although I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everyone is pleased, especially the sailors and their families, that they are returned safely, and diplomacy did lead the day, in a sense --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the only people who are unhappy about it are Republicans for some reason.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s their problem, I guess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess it is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact is that this could be very well seen as a violation of the Geneva Convention, where they were traipsed out in front of cameras -- which is totally a violation -- as prisoners, in a sense, under their jurisdiction.\xc2\xa0 Has anyone given that any thought?\xc2\xa0 And will there be a particular protest to that?\xc2\xa0 Or are you pleased that it\xe2\x80\x99s over and you\xe2\x80\x99re moving on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, JC, we certainly are pleased that it\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased that our sailors were released unharmed and promptly, 14 hours after being taken into custody, and without shots being fired to secure their release.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the Geneva Convention, my understanding is that it primarily applies to prisoners of war.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, as Doug noted, we\xe2\x80\x99re not at war with Iran.\xc2\xa0 So based on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told, the Geneva Convention doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply in this particular circumstance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, what we were focused on from the very beginning, from the earliest reports about this incident, was the safe and prompt return of our sailors.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we secure. And we did that without delaying the start of the State of the Union, and without launching any sort of military action against the nation of Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could understand how the visual effect is a serious one.\xc2\xa0 There were guns, they were blindfolded.\xc2\xa0 War or not war, it depends on your definition of what that kind of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, from that standpoint, JC -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not at war with Iran.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m also not denying that this is a dangerous situation.\xc2\xa0 Clearly it is.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for us to be appreciative of the sacrifices and risks that our men and women in the military take to keep us safe and to keep us free, and to advance our national security interests even in one of the most volatile regions of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also think it underscores the value of responsible, mature presidential leadership.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t start a war over this.\xc2\xa0 The President pursued diplomatic engagement through his Secretary of State, who had an open, diplomatic channel of communication with his Iranian counterpart.\xc2\xa0 And because of that important diplomatic work, our sailors were released, unharmed, 14 hours after being taken into custody, in their own boats.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said earlier, I think Republicans would be quite hard-pressed to make the case that a better outcome was possible here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Greg.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A year ago yesterday, Warren Weinstein was killed in a drone strike in the border region of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Both you and President Obama, I think, after that strike, promised a review of what went wrong.\xc2\xa0 And I guess, a year on, I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that you can share some of the conclusions of that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if you had the opportunity to share those conclusions with Mr. Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s family.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Greg, as the President stated last spring, there are no words that can fully describe the pain and sorrow that Dr. Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s family must be feeling about his loss.\xc2\xa0 That pain and sorrow is felt by the President himself, who took responsibility for the counterterrorism operations that are conducted in that region of the world, including the one that claimed Dr. Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s life.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President took the extraordinary step of directing his national security team to make public as many details as possible about that operation, and to be forthright about the tragic loss of life.\xc2\xa0 I should point out that Dr. Weinstein was not the only innocent civilian that was tragically killed in this incident.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s another individual from Italy, Mr. Lo Porto, who was also killed in that counterterrorism operation, and we mourn his loss as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the American people, especially the Weinstein family, deserve to know the truth about what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President directed that his team make as much of this public as possible.\xc2\xa0 Out of respect for the family, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot of more information that I can discuss publicly.\xc2\xa0 There have been -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 The handling of this particular case has allowed the government to develop some better tools to more effectively engage with families who are in this tragic situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the summer, we announced a whole set of reforms to the way in which the U.S. government is structured to ensure that we are effectively integrating the capabilities and information of a variety of government agencies that are responsible for trying to rescue American citizens.\xc2\xa0 We want that process of trying to rescue American citizens as efficient and as effective as possible, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.\xc2\xa0 But the other thing that we wanted to improve was our ability to communicate with their families and to share as much information as we possibly could about what the United States government is doing to secure the release of their loved one, and to make sure that they are updated as frequently as possible with reliable information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we put in place those reforms and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that those reforms will allow us to do this work more effectively, both in terms of rescuing more Americans, but also in terms of being more sensitive and being more effective when communicating with their families back here at home.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the investigation into the strike led you to any conclusions about drone strikes and signature strikes?\xc2\xa0 Has that led to any changes in the way we prosecute that portion of the war?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For any changes in policy, Greg, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to the intelligence community on this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, over the last several years, the President has tried to implement some reforms to our counterterrorism operations more broadly and tried to more transparent.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is clear is that there continues to be an incredibly high standard for avoiding civilian casualties when carrying out counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 That standard hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, that very high standard is also applied to operations that are carried out the United States military, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I would note, just for your reference, that just earlier today Central Command issued a news release laying out a couple of incidents in the context of our counter-ISIL campaign that led to some civilian casualties.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, that is consistent with the approach that the President has prioritized -- to be as transparent as possible about our operations, and also to be forthright when the civilian casualties that we work so hard to avoid are nonetheless sustained.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Joe, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You, too, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on one question about the sailors.\xc2\xa0 Is there no protest for the United States to file?\xc2\xa0 Or is the administration and the Pentagon leaning in the direction of saying that these were simply bad choices by the sailors?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Joe, they\'re still looking at exactly what led -- what circumstances led to these American sailors ending up in Iranian territorial waters.\xc2\xa0 And so that aspect of this particular situation continues to be under investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve talked a little bit about the linkage between the sailors and the engagement with Iran.\xc2\xa0 How much of it was improved relations with Iran that led to the release of the sailors, and how much of it was just a sense that this situation as it occurred might have thrown a wrench into the program as the IAEA report approached?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is hard to fully assess the motivations of the Iranians who ultimately made the decision to release these sailors promptly.\xc2\xa0 I think what is beyond dispute is the fact that effective diplomatic engagement from the earliest reports of this incident was critical to our success in securing their prompt release.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of diplomatic engagement, that channel of diplomatic communication was established by Secretary Kerry and his Iranian counterpart in the context of the protracted, years-long negotiations over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And look, in his inaugural address in January of 2009, the President talked about how the United States of America and our national security interests could be advanced by appropriately engaging through tough, principled diplomacy even adversaries of the United States like Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that was subject to a lot of criticism not just by Republicans, by the way.\xc2\xa0 There was a spirited debate about this in the context of the presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008.\xc2\xa0 But I think that what we have seen in terms of our progress in getting Iran to take steps to all but dismantle their nuclear infrastructure in a way that actually shuts down every pathway they have to building a nuclear weapon and quickly defusing dangerous incidents like the one that we saw with the sailors earlier this week I think is a powerful endorsement of that approach.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick El Chapo question for you.\xc2\xa0 He bragged in this Rolling Stone interview that he moved more heroin and other drugs through here than anybody else.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense as to whether that\'s true?\xc2\xa0 And is there a feeling here that extraditing him to the United States will somehow dismantle his organization where others have failed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you heard the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough say that that kind of bragging was disgusting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The desire to capture Mr. Guzman was motivated by the sense that his capture could at least disrupt the ability of an international criminal organization to traffic a variety of things, including heroin and other narcotics, through Mexico and around the world.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think, unfortunately, that we can say that this kind of capture, while significant, will succeed in dismantling that organization.\xc2\xa0 But we are hopeful that it will be a little harder for them to operate and do the damaging work that they do without their leader.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve been asked about the debate last night.\xc2\xa0 The President has sort of renewed his push to try to create reconciliation among the parties at a time when he is being harshly criticized by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Is it realistic to try to push for reconciliation at a time like this?\xc2\xa0 Or is this just going to turn into the President\xe2\x80\x99s work on getting out the base for the general election?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President made a pretty solemn commitment in the context of his State of Union to do more and to redouble his efforts to try to bridge the stark partisan divide that\'s on full display in the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are couple of ways to talk about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is, sometimes that divide is exaggerated -- because I went through some of the things, in answering Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to accomplish at the end of last year -- reform of No Child Left Behind, the transportation bill, the budget agreement, locking in the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t mention things like reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank and finally moving through IMF reform.\xc2\xa0 All of these are long-sought priorities of the administration, and all of them were accomplished in the space of like six weeks at the end of last year, and all of them by finding common ground with the newly appointed Republican Speaker of the House -- or newly elected Republican Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the kind of doom and gloom along party lines that\'s being advanced by a lot of Republicans, both in Congress and on the campaign trail, I think does make some people pessimistic about our prospects for legislative accomplishments over the course of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just over the last couple of days -- been talking about this a lot, this particular issue -- and it has become clear that there are at least six things that this administration has made a priority that seem to be priorities that are shared by at least some Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And I think in most cases, actually a majority of Republicans have identified these things are priorities, and we\'re hopeful that we can work with Republicans on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just walk you through them.\xc2\xa0 The first is criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s probably the one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the most.\xc2\xa0 There appears to be significant bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate for common-sense legislation that would reform our criminal justice in a way that would make that system more fair and make our communities more safe.\xc2\xa0 The President is certainly interested in trying to advance legislation that would accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also talked a lot about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 A lot of Republicans -- there\xe2\x80\x99s strong Republican support on Capitol Hill for that agreement.\xc2\xa0 There obviously are a lot of Republicans in Washington, D.C. who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in Congress but often support congressional campaigns who are pretty enthusiastic about the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that gives us some confidence that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to build a bipartisan majority to see that agreement be ratified this year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing I would point out, the President talked about how he was going to put Vice President Biden in charge of redoubling our efforts and ramping our investments in trying to cure cancer.\xc2\xa0 That got a lot of applause in the hall where the President was speaking on Tuesday night, and that\'s because we have seen even some conservative Republicans who don\'t have too many compliments for the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda say that they strongly support investment in medical research and development\xc2\xa0 -- both because of the economic benefits associated with those kinds of investments, but also because of the medical breakthroughs that could be realized that would save people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fourth thing I would point out, the President had pretty direct praise for Speaker Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to trying to find new ways to fight poverty.\xc2\xa0 The President singled out one policy idea that\'s Speaker Ryan had put forward this would be expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to include those workers that don\'t have children.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that actually sets up a pretty good incentive.\xc2\xa0 And we even saw some comments earlier this week after the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech from some Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee saying that they thought this could be a promising idea and that there might be an opportunity to work with the administration to advance it.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in considering.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fifth thing is fighting prescription drug abuse and heroin addiction.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of Republican presidential candidates on the campaign trail talking about this issue.\xc2\xa0 This is something the President has been talking about for quite a long time.\xc2\xa0 The Director of the ONDCP, Mr. Botticelli, has obviously made this a priority.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s got his own personal, powerful story about fighting addiction and countering addiction and helping Americans overcome addiction.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously welcome the opportunity to work with Republicans on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The sixth thing is something that at least some Republicans support, and this may be an area where there\xe2\x80\x99s not a majority of Republicans, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just on an AUMF -- an authorization to use military force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously something that the President is enthusiastic about.\xc2\xa0 I know that Speaker Ryan has been hosting discussions on Capitol Hill, asking other Republicans to start talking about how to advance this kind of legislation through the House.\xc2\xa0 I know there are some members of the Senate who feel strongly, both on the Democratic and Republican side, that this is something that Congress should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we obviously have demonstrated a willingness to work with members of Congress on this issue.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we actually -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t just call on them to pass an AUMF; we actually wrote a suggested AUMF and sent it to them so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do too much work.\xc2\xa0 And then we actually sent senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team to testify about this legislation in an open hearing in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re clearly committed to this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, those are six important things, and if we could make some progress on those six things, even in the context of an election year and even in the context of a Democratic President and a Republican-dominated Congress, that would be a pretty good thing.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly hopeful that we can do that.\xc2\xa0 Sorry for the long answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for taking the question.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the situation with Iran and the sailors.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see their actions as a violation of the Military Code of Conduct, and specifically the \xe2\x80\x9cI will not surrender under my own freewill\xe2\x80\x9d -- the command, \xe2\x80\x9cI will never surrender the members of my command while we still have the means to resist\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Did they have the means to resist?\xc2\xa0 Was the boat disabled, so they didn\xe2\x80\x99the?\xc2\xa0 What was the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is precisely part of the ongoing Department of Defense investigation.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m quite limited in what I can say about this just because I speak on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of sensitivity about the Commander-in-Chief even being seen as interfering in an ongoing Department of Defense review, particularly one that I guess as you point out could have some criminal consequences.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave all of that to the Department of Justice and just out of an abundance of caution, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much I can say about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense whether they made this video statement under duress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s unclear.\xc2\xa0 I think common sense tells you that that certainly is a possibility, but this is something the Department of Defense is taking a look at as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then you guys put out a factsheet this morning talking about the momentum in the fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I just had -- you guys are talking about all the progress and everything that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made really over the last year and a half -- that ISIL hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had any major strategic victories since May, 2015.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view that we\xe2\x80\x99re winning this war?\xc2\xa0 Can you put on your football hat and say maybe what the score is, what quarter it\xe2\x80\x99s in, or anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 The President has been quite clear from the beginning that there would be areas of progress and some periods of setback.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is the nature of any sort of military conflict, particularly one that\xe2\x80\x99s as unwieldy as this one.\xc2\xa0 I think, John, the best way to answer your question is that over the last several months, the United States and our 65 coalition partners have enjoyed a lot of progress, and there are a variety of ways to measure that, which is -- a couple of the best ways that come to mind would be the successful completion of the operation that was carried out by Iraqi forces to retake Ramadi from ISIL forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously it was a pretty significant setback, one that we acknowledged here, when ISIL did capture Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 And it was a long planned and long -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 It took significant effort and a lot of planning to mount the kind of campaign that succeeded in driving ISIL out of Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 And that was an important indication that the kind of strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve long discussed from here could work -- and that is, the United States and our coalition partners working closely with Iraqi forces to offer training, advice, and assistance to those Iraqi forces, to make sure that they have the necessary equipment, and then to back up their efforts on the ground with airstrikes from the United States and our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 That was the recipe that allowed them to drive ISIL out of Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an encouraging development.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the other thing that I would point to is -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this was listed on the factsheet, but we can get you more details on this -- is that in the last couple of weeks in December, the United States and our coalition partners undertook the kind of strikes that allowed us to take 10 ISIL leaders off the battlefield just in that relatively narrow period of time, including a couple that had connections to the network that carried out the attacks against innocent civilians in Paris.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that is an indication of the resolve that\xe2\x80\x99s being demonstrated by the United States and our coalition partners to hold ISIL accountable for their efforts to try to target innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also an indication that our efforts to develop intelligence and to learn as much as we can about ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s leaders is yielding some fruit.\xc2\xa0 And the more pressure that we can apply to those ISIL leaders, the more worried we can make them about their own personal safety, the harder it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be for them to plot and plan and carry out attacks against the West.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that element of our strategy is also functioning at a high level and yielding some important results.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this reluctance to say whether you\xe2\x80\x99re winning or losing, is that a reflection of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ability to launch these one-off attacks in Paris and the connections with San Bernardino, and now Jakarta?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is a reflection of the fact that these kinds of military conflicts often don\xe2\x80\x99t lend themselves very well to sports metaphors; that that\xe2\x80\x99s not an accurate way or an apt way to help people understand exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly mindful of the ongoing risk that ISIL poses both because of foreign fighters and because of their sophisticated use of social media.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also undeniable is that when you take a look at the battlefield inside of Iraq and in Syria, there\xe2\x80\x99s important progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made by the United States and our coalition partners, including Iraqi forces in Iraq and some of the moderate Syrian opposition fighters that are taking the fight to ISIL on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few questions, mostly nut-and-bolt ones.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any opinion on the New York law that would force backdoor encryption access?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk that local governments could have access to information of the federal government, if that New York law were passed?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I have to admit, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that New York law, but why don\xe2\x80\x99t I have my colleagues at the NSC who work on this issue see if we can get you a response.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the person who\xe2\x80\x99s very familiar with it at Bloomberg.\xc2\xa0 And then another nuts-and-bolts question -- the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate yesterday said they were working on an effort to address international corporate tax law, including both inversions -- which the White House is certainly quite concerned about -- and repatriation.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House going to engage with them on this?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of whether you can support this effort for a legislation that would address these specific international tax law consequences?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the specific proposals that they have put forward, but I think that the things that you have identified -- or I guess that you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified that they have identified -- are also problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to engage in a discussion with Republicans on Capitol Hill about making our tax code more fair, more simple.\xc2\xa0 And particularly when it comes to the corporate tax code, there is the potential that we could close some loopholes that only benefit wealthy and well-connected corporations, and potentially even lower the rate for everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we want to do this in a fiscally responsible way.\xc2\xa0 We want to do this in a way that reflects sort of our priority of expanding economic opportunity for everybody in America, particularly middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And the President has talked about how there are some elements of our corporate tax code that are quite unfair.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not middle-class families that are stashing their profits overseas to try to avoid taxes; it\xe2\x80\x99s well-connected corporations that are taking advantage of those tax havens.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Part of the idea is for you to let them bring that money back --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, and so that\xe2\x80\x99s -- so the question is can you do that in a way that actually is fair?\xc2\xa0 There are -- the previous time that this was done -- I know that there are a number of studies that have taken a close look at this -- that the previous time that this occurred, the revenue that was generated by that repatriation holiday was dedicated much more to things like corporate bonuses and padding the bottom lines of the companies, and not on like creating jobs and other things that would actually be good for the broader economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think we can find some optimism in the idea that both Democrats and Republicans agree that these kinds of loopholes in the corporate tax code are a problem.\xc2\xa0 But thus far, our proposed solutions have been quite different.\xc2\xa0 And I think that just, frankly, reflects the differences in the priorities that have been identified by the individual parties.\xc2\xa0 But that certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent us from having a conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious how you can say, if we accept that Islamic State is following a terrorist strategy -- which I think most people do -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had no strategic victories in recent months.\xc2\xa0 I realize short of taking over a country\xe2\x80\x99s capital, victory can be in the eye of the beholder.\xc2\xa0 But given that the whole idea of a terrorist strategy, conventional military thinking is to affect audiences, domestic, foreign, your own organization, your potential sympathizers, how can you analyze that attack in Paris as not a strategic victory for a terrorist strategy, or an attack -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a tiny one -- in the United States as not a strategic victory for the kind of terrorist strategy that they\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the factsheet that we put out was specifically related to our military efforts to counter ISIL, and the sentence is just that ISIL has not had any major strategic victories in Iraq or Syria since May of 2015.\xc2\xa0 So they were pretty specific -- but I definitely want to make sure that you take a look at the factsheet when you get a chance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some reporting suggesting that the White House national security team is in the final stages of reviewing a Pentagon proposal to close Gitmo.\xc2\xa0 True?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can confirm for you is that the Pentagon, at the instruction of the President, has been working on developing a plan for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 The thing that -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on that for some time.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated time frame for you in terms of when that will be produced, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that the White House is reviewing now that they have sent over, essentially?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I know this is something that the Pentagon has been working on a lot.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of conversations with White House officials about the development of that plan.\xc2\xa0 So, presumably, the White House has some insight into the work that they are doing and has had an opportunity to talk to them about that work.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ve e-mailed over a draft version or anything.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The thing that I would tell you about that plan is that, first of all, it is something that we are planning to present to Congress.\xc2\xa0 When we do, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll also make public so all of you will have an opportunity to take a look at it as well.\xc2\xa0 And I would also encourage you to not give into a sense of mystery about the plan.\xc2\xa0 I think our strategy that we have been pursuing for quite some time is familiar to those of you who have been watching this issue for years now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a strategy for working with partners around the world to transfer those individuals who can be transferred into situations where the threat that they pose to the United States is sufficiently mitigated.\xc2\xa0 We also have a strategy for putting some of these Gitmo detainees through a legal process, either military commissions or Article 3 courts, to bring them to justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a certain other group of individuals who are not likely to be able to be transferred because they\xe2\x80\x99re so dangerous, but yet, they\xe2\x80\x99re also probably not going to -- the evidence that\xe2\x80\x99s been collected against them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily lend them to the kind of military commission that has been successful in other areas.\xc2\xa0 So those individuals, resolving their case is the hardest part of all this.\xc2\xa0 And the case that we would make to members of Congress is that continuing to hold those individuals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for our national security interests because we know that terrorist organizations around the world use the operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is it\xe2\x80\x99s also an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 It costs right now about $4 million per detainee per year to keep them at the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 We could confine them in a different place in a way that would fully protect our national security for much less money, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to say that the plans that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at -- there are still a group of detainees whose fate will not be resolved by transfer or by prosecution?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still this group -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s several dozen -- that will be in this legal limbo now for perhaps as long as 10, 12 years?\xc2\xa0 That clearly is not a good situation for the United States from a propaganda point of view or from a values point of view.\xc2\xa0 What happens to them?\xc2\xa0 Do they just go to one of these three federal prisons or detention centers in the United States and languish further?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we have to do is we have to figure out, frankly, a more effective way to confine them than we do right now at the Prison at Guantanamo Bay -- a way that reflects our national security interests but also our commitment to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that working through the challenges of their situation continues to be difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the number now?\xc2\xa0 About 25, is it, 30?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of those individuals?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A couple dozen is the way that I would describe it.\xc2\xa0 But we can get you a more precise number.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Time frame on turning this plan over to Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on timing. And just to be as candid as I can here, back in July I was asked about it and I told all of you that it would be relatively soon. It\xe2\x80\x99s now January and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been produced at this point, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to make any more promises on the timing.\xc2\xa0 But once it is something that we have produced to Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that all of you get a chance to take a look at it, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, is it fair to say that the plans that the administration is looking at will still result with a couple dozen detainees whose situation is not resolved and who will still be in a legal limbo many years later?\xc2\xa0 You still can\xe2\x80\x99t figure that out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is true, Ron, is that the goal of this plan is not to resolve all of the status -- the individual status of every single detainee at the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 The goal of this plan is to put forward a strategy for actually closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that will mean putting individuals through military commission proceedings.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, and in the vast majority of cases, it means transferring those individuals to other countries who have appropriate security arrangements in place to take them on.\xc2\xa0 But for this other group of individuals, it means finding a more effective way to detain them so that they don\xe2\x80\x99t pose a threat to our national security, so that they don\xe2\x80\x99t serve as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations around the world, and do all of that in a much more cost-effective way than we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot.\xc2\xa0 So yesterday, 10 detainees from Guantanamo arrived in Oman.\xc2\xa0 I believe the Joint Task Force on Guantanamo deemed that five of them were a grave risk to the U.S. and American interests.\xc2\xa0 The word that you\'ve used, the Pentagon uses is that they were transferred.\xc2\xa0 Are these individuals essentially going from one prison cell in Guantanamo to another prison cell in Oman?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The security arrangements that are in place for these individual detainees -- all 10 of these were Yemeni detainees -- and these are individuals that were essentially placed in a rehabilitation program that Oman runs.\xc2\xa0 That rehabilitation program, as you would expect, also includes significant security limitations.\xc2\xa0 That is to say --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\'re not in prison?\xc2\xa0 They come and go as they please.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they are monitored around the clock, and their ability to travel is limited.\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t speak to whether or not they\'re in a prison cell or not, but I can tell you that steps like monitoring all their activities, keeping close tabs on their communications, limiting their ability to travel, and also putting them through this rehabilitation program that has a track record of rehabilitation radicalized individuals is a way to get them out of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, but do it in a way that mitigates the risk of the threat that they pose to U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not just my assessment.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the assessment of the President of United States.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense himself has to personally certify that the appropriate security precautions have been taken.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, they have.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true that other detainees that have gone through rehabilitation programs have ended back on the battlefield, essentially rejoining the fight against the United States and American interests.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if that\'s true or not.\xc2\xa0 We can check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 What is true is that the track record of detainees that have been transferred under the regime that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place with other countries, that essentially the recidivism rate is actually much lower, which is to say many fewer as a percentage of those individuals that have been transferred have rejoined the fight than those who were transferred under the system that was in place prior to the President taking office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These 10 individuals, Yemenis, they can\'t go back to Yemen because of the civil war that\'s going on there right now.\xc2\xa0 The President once called Yemen a \xe2\x80\x9cmodel of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does he stand by that statement?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That statement, John, was referenced specifically to our counterterrorism efforts inside of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President ever made the case that Jeffersonian democracy was sprouting in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was making the case that the United States, at a point in time, had an effective counterterrorism relationship with the Yemeni government that put significant pressure on extremists that were operating in that country and had aspirations for trying to harm the United States and the West.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll also point out that there have been occasions, even since the onset of this strife inside of Yemen, where the United States has preserved our ability to carry out strikes against extremists inside of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 So, again, Yemen is a dangerous place with a lot of problems, but it is a place where we have been very effective in applying significant pressure to leaders of terrorist organizations that are operating in Yemen and occasionally taking those leaders off the battlefield.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You and the President have both cited that the number-one reason for closing Guantanamo is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a recruiting tool for terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Can you think of another example where the United States government sort of bases its policy on what terrorists think -- which is what you\'re doing when you say it\xe2\x80\x99s a recruiting tool for terrorists, right?\xc2\xa0 You\'re worried about how terrorists view Guantanamo, and that\'s the reason why you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to close Guantanamo.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, John, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just reading the minds of terrorists.\xc2\xa0 We actually have tangible evidence that extremists use images from the prison in Guantanamo Bay and language describing the prison to try to recruit people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past six months, can you think of or cite one video in which Guantanamo has been mentioned or seen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you the intel community that keeps tabs on these kinds of things, but I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think -- just to go back to sort of your broader question -- one of the reasons that we spend a lot of time thinking about how to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s online activities is because we are concerned about the way that they\'re able to recruit and inspire vulnerable individuals to take up the cause of these extremists.\xc2\xa0 So it is important for us to do as much as we can to try to counter their efforts to influence the thoughts and emotions of vulnerable individuals around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s the essence of this social media strategy that we\'re trying to implement -- both in terms of the conversations that senior administration officials had in Silicon Valley last week, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also part of the kinds of fusion centers that we\'re setting up in places like the UAE and in Malaysia to serve as regional operations to try to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in those regions of the world, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll also point out that, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just me and the President who are concerned about the way that extremists use the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.\xc2\xa0 People like President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, who served both George W. Bush and Barack Obama as Defense Secretary, they agree with us, too.\xc2\xa0 They agree with this concern about the way that the prison at Guantanamo Bay and its continued operation undermines our ability to fight terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s your belief that if Guantanamo were closed today that recruitment of individuals by ISIS, by Al Qaeda would be so much more difficult because Guantanamo is no longer around?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that they would have one less recruiting tool in the toolbox to inspire people to carry out acts of violence against innocent Americans or, frankly, innocent people anywhere in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And when you couple that with the fact that right now it costs $4 million \xc2\xa0per detainee per year to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not a good use of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even if there are Republicans who are skeptical of the claim that the recruitment value of the prison at Guantanamo Bay is minimal, well, surely these guys who are strongly opposed to government spending would enthusiastically embrace an opportunity to save taxpayers some money.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly has embraced that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And the President I think would be the first one to tell you that this has been part of basically every conversation that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with the Department of Defense</p>\n<p>\n\t-- about the need to put this plan together is to do so mindful of the impact that it has on taxpayers and the way their money is spent.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is there a specific reason why you put out the ISIL factsheet today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just be blunt with you -- it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday.\xc2\xa0 This was a document that we had planned to release in the context of the State of the Union address, and because there was so much interagency and international coordination involved in putting it together, the deadline slipped a little bit, so we got it out today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of the State of the Union address, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a leftover question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware that Senate President pro tempore Orrin Hatch didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend the speech so that he could be the designated survivor in the case of a catastrophe, even though you guys said that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson was in that role?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We were aware of that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that this is actually something that Congress has done more than once since 9/11.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that they make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But because he\xe2\x80\x99s President pro tempore of the Senate, he would not only be able to take over Congress, he would -- he\xe2\x80\x99s ahead of Jeh Johnson in the statutory line of succession for President.\xc2\xa0 So he would be in a dual role there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House ready to accept him in that role in the line of succession?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the White House was hopeful that this was an eventuality that would not occur.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you were aware of it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Hatch would even be in that category.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does it mean that by designating Jeh Johnson, it was duplicative?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that these kinds of actions are always taken out of an abundance of caution, obviously.\xc2\xa0 You have to ask my colleagues in Congress about Senator Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s decision to not attend the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about whether or not Senator Hatch just stayed home or went back to Utah or was in the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Undisclosed location.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- or an undisclosed location.\xc2\xa0 But look, we take all of the necessary contingency steps, even the ones that are taken solely out of an abundance of caution, to ensure that the United States government, even in the event of the unthinkable, needs to persist.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why we took the steps with Secretary Johnson this year that we have in previous years.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that even when Democrats were in charge of the Senate, that this is something they periodically did, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Susan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wanted to follow up on a Gitmo question.\xc2\xa0 How long -- quickly -- how long are these detainees that were released -- how long are they staying in Oman?\xc2\xa0 And how long is the rehabilitation center?\xc2\xa0 And why is that so opaque to the American public?\xc2\xa0 Why is this process -- why don\xe2\x80\x99t I know, for instance, who -- I follow this pretty closely?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Department of Defense did put out a news release on this, so we can certainly get you the paperwork that describes the circumstances of their transfer in more detail.\xc2\xa0 So it is something that we have made public.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the news release in front of me.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been a couple days since I looked at it in terms of the -- so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know off the top of my head whether or not there was a description of the amount of time that they would be in this rehabilitation program, but we can check on that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I guess let me say one other thing.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, there are actually diplomatic sensitivities with the other countries in terms of making public the circumstances of them taking on these individuals.\xc2\xa0 So sometimes, I think as you would anticipate, there is some complicated diplomacy that goes into these transfers, and so sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s a little less transparency than there otherwise would be in deference to, frankly, the sacrifice that our partners and allies are making in taking on these individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- his State of the Union regrets, his statements about his regrets -- about the partisan rancor in Washington and how he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to deal with it -- hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to bridge that divide -- I had spoken to Representative Murphy last week about his mental health bill.\xc2\xa0 This is a bill that he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on for years, since the Sandy Hook shootings.\xc2\xa0 And he said he\xe2\x80\x99s tried repeatedly to contact the White House about this and to engage the White House Leg Affairs office, the President himself, and he said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had his phone calls returned; that this is something that he really wants to work with the White House on.\xc2\xa0 It seems like -- he said he was sort of blindsided by the mental health money that you all released last week and your gun initiatives.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this an example of something where it was an obvious place where you could work together? Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that groundwork done from the White House to Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 And can you foresee that happening in the future with Tim Murphy and others on mental health issues? And is your -- basically, my own overall question is, is the White House Leg Affairs going to beef up now that the President has said he wants to work with Republicans where we can work with Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Susan, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to all of the conversations between the White House and Congressman Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 Based on the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking your question today, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty high likelihood his office will get a phone call today.\xc2\xa0 I think in general we are interested in working with Congress on trying to expand mental health care to Americans all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken with varying proportions of frustration and disappointment about the fact that Republicans profess a sincere interest in mental health care expansion while at the same time voting dozens of times to actually repeal the legislation that has done more to expand mental health care than any other legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s passed in decades -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There are millions of Americans that have been able to get access to mental health care services as a result of Medicaid expansion, for example, that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously have.\xc2\xa0 But yet, Republicans are dogged in their attempt to try to repeal that legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think there is reason for us to be skeptically, generally, of Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 interest in this particular area.\xc2\xa0 I am skeptical of their sincerity about this.\xc2\xa0 But they have an opportunity to prove us wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Congressman Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s office will get a call today.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to previous conversations that may have occurred around this, but there is a genuine interest on the part of the White House in trying to make progress when it comes to expanding access to mental health care, and we are certainly willing and ready to work with Republicans who share that priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Victoria, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that the U.S. sailors had mis-navigated.\xc2\xa0 Is it the thinking that one or both of the boats mis-navigated?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the circumstances that led them to end up in Iranian territorial waters is something that\xe2\x80\x99s still under investigation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Secretary of Defense has access to more information about that ongoing investigation than I do, but I made note of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s comments as well, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak with any firsthand knowledge of what exactly happened that resulted in them being in Iranian territorial waters.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something the Department of Defense is looking at.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The area where they were is known for espionage by many different countries.\xc2\xa0 Can you assure us that they were not engaged in spying?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, for details about what operation they were pursuing, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any firsthand knowledge of what their operation was.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President and First Lady will participate in a community service project in the Washington, D.C. area to celebrate the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.\xc2\xa0 There will be travel pool coverage of that community service project.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will welcome Prime Minister Turnbull of Australia to the White House.\xc2\xa0 It will be the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s first trip to Washington since taking office.\xc2\xa0 The leaders will hold a bilateral meeting and a working lunch, during which they will highlight the extraordinary breadth of the U.S.-Australian alliance, and discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues, including our cooperation in Iraq and in Syria, our trade relationship, the successful conclusion of negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and other developments in Asia and the Pacific.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAustralia has made substantial contributions when it comes to our counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 There are Australian military pilots that have flown with American military pilots in the skies over Iraq and Syria, taking strikes against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we know that Australia has also made a substantial contribution to the training, advising, and assist effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously deeply appreciative of what the Australians have done to further our coalition\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that will be a part of the discussion between the two leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will travel to Detroit, Michigan, to experience firsthand the remarkable progress made by the city, its people, and neighborhoods, and the American auto industry.\xc2\xa0 While in Detroit, the President will visit the 2016 North American International Auto Show to highlight the more than 640,000 new auto industry jobs that were created since the auto rescue, and the record auto sales in the United States in 2015.\xc2\xa0 Additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Michigan will be made available either over the weekend or at the beginning of next week.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will deliver remarks and host a reception for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s mayors here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President will spend time -- the mayors will spend the evening at the White House, interacting with Cabinet members and senior White House officials to expand the partnerships between cities and the federal government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then next Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hope you all have a good weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you briefing on Monday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will not.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully I will still be savoring the glow of the Chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 playoff victory on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See you guys.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</p>\n<p class="rtecenter">\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 12:51 P.M.
