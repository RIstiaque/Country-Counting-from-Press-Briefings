Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:50 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see that the month of August did not dissuade you from participating today. \xc2\xa0So appreciate you making it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements at the top, Josh, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0In Texas, the attorney general, Ken Paxton, has been charged with a felony and booked into jail. \xc2\xa0And I know that you tend not to weigh in on criminal investigations, particularly those in states, but in this instance, this attorney general has really been the driving force behind the legal challenges to the President\xe2\x80\x99s immigration policies and has really been a thorn in your side on some other environmental issues, including the Clean Power Plan. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any thoughts about how his criminal investigation may affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, I heard about the news reports of this particular legal matter only recently, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in on what appears to be an ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0The Department of Justice continues to be an aggressive advocate for the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, including the executive actions that the President took at the end of last year to bring some much-needed accountability to our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there has, in fact, been a concerted partisan effort to try to undermine the implementation of those rules. \xc2\xa0But we continue to aggressively advocate in the courts to continue the implementation of those rules, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that regardless of any sort of legal problems that may be faced by some of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the Clean Power Plan that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be discussing, the President will be discussing later today, already a lot of reaction from both sides of the aisle in the presidential race. \xc2\xa0And one of the things that seems notable about what the Republicans have been saying is they\xe2\x80\x99ve been making some specific criticisms about costs or other factors that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like in this, but they seem to be shying away from the kind of blanket ignoring of climate change as a problem that you have discussed it being the way that they had in the past and that you pointed out they had in the past. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you see a shift there, and whether Republicans seem more willing to embrace the issue as an issue, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t like your specific plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting observation. \xc2\xa0I had not reached that conclusion. \xc2\xa0It sounds like you may have studied some of these statements from the candidates more closely than I did.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, if acknowledging that you have a problem is the first step in trying to solve it, then we welcome the renewed interest by Republicans in confronting this issue. \xc2\xa0The fact is, this is an issue that politicians in Washington have been putting off for too long. \xc2\xa0And in this case, I think they have a decent excuse, which is there are some tough choices. \xc2\xa0And one of the challenges that we have in our political system is getting our system oriented to focus on addressing problems over the longer term. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, that is what has contributed to this becoming a more significant problem over the years. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in some ways, this is exactly the kind of issue that the President ran for this office to address. \xc2\xa0In 2007 and 2008, much of the President\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric was directed toward changing business as usual in Washington and confronting the tough issues. \xc2\xa0And this is a great example of that. \xc2\xa0And that is why you heard the President himself describe this issue, or these rules as the most significant steps that our country has ever taken to fight the causes of climate change and to curb carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the other reasons that we may see at least a slightly muted response from some Republicans is that in designing this rule, the administration has focused on the successful implementation of the rules. \xc2\xa0That is why this is all geared toward setting targets that states must meet, but also giving states ample opportunity and freedom to design a plan that will allow them to meet those targets in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the needs of the people in their state.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the other things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is, since this proposed rule has been made final, the Environmental Protection Agency has considered 4 million different comments from the public about the initial proposed rule that was put forward. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why in the final rule you see that states have a full year under which they can submit their plans. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also given states a couple of additional years to begin implementing those plans, all while preserving the incentives that exist on the front end for states to continue to make investments in renewable energy that we know can be good for the planet, can be good for our economy, and can actually save consumers on their utility bills.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the approach that we have taken has been to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation. \xc2\xa0And that should be an indication to you that this administration is not so much worried about the politics, but actually worried about trying to get these rules right. \xc2\xa0Because implementing these rules accurately and successfully will allow us to achieve a significant economic benefit for us to protect public health in a way that we can reduce incidents of asthma and reduce the number of asthma attacks, and also save consumers on their utility bills.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if successfully implemented, this could benefit the American public in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a number of industry groups that are planning to sue the administration over this rule have written already to the administration today asking you to put the rule on hold while those legal challenges play out. \xc2\xa0Will the administration grant that request?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any consideration to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to defend Syrian rebels with air power, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s loyal to the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. concerned that it\xe2\x80\x99s deepening its role in the Syrian conflict, or raising the risk of a direct confrontation with Assad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that question in a couple of ways. \xc2\xa0That first is that the train-and-equip program that the President announced almost a year ago now has been focused on preparing adequately vetted Syrian opposition forces to counter ISIL. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that a critical element of our counter-ISIL campaign is finding partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. \xc2\xa0The President has said, even in the face of criticism from some Republicans, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to commit a significant number of U.S. military personnel on the ground in a combat role in either Iraq or in Syria. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged for some time that we had a little bit of a head start in Iraq because we had a central government in Iraq that was willing to pursue a multi-sectarian agenda and to lead the military in a multi-sectarian and inclusive way. \xc2\xa0And that meant that we did have a fighting force on the ground in Iraq that the United States and our coalition partners could partner with.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have seen significant progress in terms of rolling back ISIL gains inside of Iraq. \xc2\xa0And the latest statistic is that up to 25 percent of the populated area that was previously controlled by ISIL is now an area -- are now locations where ISIL can no longer enjoy freedom of movement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe story is a little bit different in Syria because there is not a fighting force on the ground with which the United States has been -- the United States and our coalition partners has been able to partner with. \xc2\xa0We have had some success in partnering with some Kurdish groups on the ground inside of Syria, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress against ISIL, particularly in northern Syria. \xc2\xa0But building up the capacity of a force of opposition fighters is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on for quite some time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the goal of training and equipping those opposition fighters has been to focus our efforts on ISIL. \xc2\xa0And at the commencement of our campaign against ISIL, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the United States sent a clear signal to the Assad regime that they should not interfere with our ongoing counter-ISIL efforts, even inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And that same admonition applies when it comes to the activities of these new Syrian fighter -- or new Syrian forces on the ground that have been trained and equipped by our coalition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are already steps that our coalition has taken to protect these counter-ISIL fighters from attacks, and we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, so that these fighters who are put on the ground to fight ISIL can succeed in that mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Unrelated -- over the weekend, there were reports that the U.S. Olympic committee -- sorry, not U.S. -- the Olympic committee is looking at U.S. cities, three U.S. cities to take the place of Boston, since they dropped their bid. \xc2\xa0The President did not publicly campaign for Boston to be considered. \xc2\xa0Would he do that for another city? \xc2\xa0Or is it now his policy, since he was not successful in getting Chicago to be considered -- is it his policy to stay out of any campaigning for American cities to host the Olympics?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think once the U.S. Olympic committee has selected an American city to bid on the -- I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s the 2024 Games, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will be supportive of a U.S. bid. \xc2\xa0It sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s still some work to be done to determine exactly which city will mount that effort. \xc2\xa0But if the President would willingly lend his support to that bid.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would he go so far as to -- actually, at that point, I guess maybe he could be out of the White House. \xc2\xa0But when he was campaigning for Chicago, he went so far as to travel -- meet with an international body and put his public support behind that. \xc2\xa0Is that something that he\xe2\x80\x99s refraining from doing, since he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t successful with Chicago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where they are in the process either, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly when those bids will finally be considered by the international Olympic committee. \xc2\xa0But certainly once the U.S. OC has selected an American bid city, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will be strongly supportive of that American bid.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0Nadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on Syria -- so basically you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there is an agreement between you, the United States government, and the Syrian regime not to attack the opposition that you are training because they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting ISIS?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would not describe it as an agreement. \xc2\xa0In some ways, I would describe it as an admonition -- one that we directed to the Assad regime at the very beginning of this effort last fall, where U.S. officials made clear to the Assad regime that they should not interfere with our ongoing counter-ISIL efforts inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0At that point, we were principally referring to any temptation that the Assad regime may have to interfere in the air campaign against ISIL inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that that same admonition that the Assad regime should not interfere in our counter-ISIL activities also applies to the opposition fighters that we have trained and equipped to fight ISIL. \xc2\xa0So far, the Assad regime has followed that admonition from the United States, and we encourage them to continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what will happen when these Syrian groups that you are training are engaged with the Assad forces? \xc2\xa0How can you stop that? \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a theoretical question. \xc2\xa0I mean, it could happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the fact that it could happen is a hypothetical. \xc2\xa0At this point, it has not. \xc2\xa0And we have made clear that these fighters have been trained and equipped to participate in the counter-ISIL effort. \xc2\xa0And our coalition has been involved in that train-and-equip effort, and our opposition will be engaged -- and our coalition will be engaged in protecting their ability to take the fight to ISIL on the ground. \xc2\xa0And that means protecting them so that they can carry out that fight against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Syria again, you often say that the Assad regime has no future in running the country. \xc2\xa0And now there is talk that the Russians and the United States, and maybe Gulf countries are meeting in Doha as we speak with Secretary Kerry, that they will discuss a plan whereby Assad will be part of the coalition. \xc2\xa0Does this contradict your stand, or this is a new development, a new strategy regarding Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Nadia, what we have made clear is that because of the frequency with which the Assad regime has used the military power of that country and directed it at Syrian citizens, that President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0That has been our policy for some time, and that continues to be our policy today.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have tried to do for years, and admittedly with not a lot of success, is to facilitate a sustainable, durable political process that would allow a transition, a leadership transition, to occur inside Syria. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard to try to bring the opposition together, sit them down at the negotiating table to make a determination about this political transition, and we have not made a lot of progress on that. \xc2\xa0But we continue to believe that that actually is the way to resolve the situation inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe chaos -- the political chaos that has persisted inside of Syria for so long is what\xe2\x80\x99s allowed extremist organizations like ISIL to gain a foothold in that country. \xc2\xa0And to try to bring that violence to an end, we certainly need to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0But to solve this problem over the long term, we need to bring about a political transition inside Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry to push again, but he\xe2\x80\x99s an ally with you against ISIS, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not an ally with you when he\xe2\x80\x99s fighting his own people and killing Syrians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I would *not describe him as an ally in our fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0Certainly he has indicated, and even ordered, some military action against ISIL fighters. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the Assad regime should not interfere in the ongoing efforts of the United States and our coalition partners to execute a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Iran. \xc2\xa0The President has a big speech planned this week that we already know about. \xc2\xa0Can you fill us in beyond that on kind of how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pace himself through the month of August? \xc2\xa0And maybe since this week is right in front of us, is he doing daily calls? \xc2\xa0Is he talking to individual members of Congress? \xc2\xa0Is he letting the pro-deal, lobbying interests work their way first? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific telephone calls to tell you about, but the President over the course of this week will continue to be in touch with individual members of Congress on this particular issue. \xc2\xa0House members have left Washington, as we talked about a little bit at the end of last week. \xc2\xa0But United States Senators remain, so I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional conversations or meetings with members of the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tI also would anticipate that the President would be in touch with other stakeholders who have shown an interest in this particular issue. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that tomorrow the President will convene a meeting with the leaders of some prominent Jewish American organizations who have shown a particular interest in this issue, primarily because of their concern about its impact on the national security of the nation of Israel. \xc2\xa0The President will come prepared to make a strong case that all of you have heard about how he believes that this historic agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn\xe2\x80\x99t just in the best interest of the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly within the national security interest of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. \xc2\xa0And the President will have the opportunity to talk to them about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the other thing, Margaret, I think that is notable is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress and are building up some momentum on Capitol Hill, and that over the last 48 to 72 hours, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some notable names come out in support of the agreement. \xc2\xa0This includes Iraq war veteran, Seth Moulton, from Massachusetts, who talked about his firsthand experience fighting a war in the Middle East -- led him to conclude that this agreement makes a future war in the Middle East at least less likely. \xc2\xa0We also saw powerful statements from Adam Schiff, who\xe2\x80\x99s the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee -- somebody who initially described himself as a skeptic of the agreement, who, after hearing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s case, came around to supporting the agreement. \xc2\xa0And even Senator Warren indicated her strong support for this deal. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re building some momentum on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say, we\xe2\x80\x99re not taking any of these votes for granted. \xc2\xa0And the President and other senior members of his national security team will continue to make this case not just through the remainder of this week, but over the course of this month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the leaders tomorrow, is that the kind of usual -- is that the donor group or is that the organization\xe2\x80\x99s group, or is it both in one? \xc2\xa0And is it at the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of those who will be attending, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some more information about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just slide in one more question?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You may have heard over the weekend a flurry of speculation about whether the Vice President was going to run for President. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did hear a little bit about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So has the President talked to him since that flurry of speculation? \xc2\xa0And did this come up? \xc2\xa0And can you kind of articulate for us, in light of the coverage over the weekend, how the President intends to handle either private discussions with him about it or public speculation between now and September when he decides?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I would anticipate is that the President will keep his private discussions with the Vice President of the United States private. \xc2\xa0And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of insight to share with you about either the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking or his discussions with the President on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the Vice President has said publicly is that a possible campaign for the presidency is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s considering, and he anticipated that he would make a decision by the end of this summer. \xc2\xa0And so obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re in the first week of August and we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to the end of the summer, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet. \xc2\xa0And somebody with the extensive experience of the Vice President, and somebody who has made such a significant contribution to the safety and prosperity of his country should be afforded the opportunity to make that decision on a timeframe that he chooses. \xc2\xa0And it sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on Iran. \xc2\xa0The President seems to have gotten the support that he wanted from the Gulf States -- that Secretary Kerry came out of those meetings and there\xe2\x80\x99s at least tacit vocal support for the deal. \xc2\xa0So, one is, what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that? \xc2\xa0And two, does that undercut the argument being made by groups such as APEC and others who are saying that this agreement is a threat to the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s Middle East allies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Carol, I saw this right before I came out here, too. \xc2\xa0And this is what I think is a rather rough translation of the comments from the Qatari Foreign Minister. \xc2\xa0And he said, just in part, all the efforts -- referring to the effort to negotiate an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 -- that have been exerted make this region very secure and very stable. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication, at least on the part of the Foreign Minister of Qatar, that completing a diplomatic agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is in the security interest of at least the nation of Qatar. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is certainly aware of the impact that this agreement would have on the national security not just of our closest ally in the region, Israel, but also on our partners in the Middle East that are often subject to some of the destabilizing activities of Iran and their proxies in the region. \xc2\xa0And that is why the President convened a meeting with some of the leaders of those countries at Camp David earlier this summer to discuss how the United States could deepen our security cooperation with the GCC countries. \xc2\xa0And much of that discussion centered on how the GCC countries, with the support of the United States, could better coordinate their own security activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one of the things that was discussed was trying to put in place anti-ballistic missile technology and capabilities that would provide for the joint security of those nations. \xc2\xa0And obviously the United States could be supportive of that effort in terms of providing some expertise and equipment and training. \xc2\xa0But ultimately this would be a joint capability that would be developed and maintained and operated by those GCC countries. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to deepen his cooperation with our GCC partners in the region. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as the President himself has said, he would not have pursued this agreement unless he was completely confident that it was in the best national security interest of the United States, first and foremost, but also in the interest of our allies and partners in the region. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to hear that at least some representatives of those GCC countries have now clearly stated that they agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does this help his case? \xc2\xa0And can you answer the question about does it undercut that particular argument that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do think it undercuts the argument because we have seen some who have made the case that this agreement would have a negative impact on the security situation of our partners in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0The President does not at all agree with that assessment. \xc2\xa0In fact, he thinks it strengthens the national security considerations of our allies and partners in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0And we welcome the statement from leaders of those countries who indicate that they agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, Josh, federal agents are going to assist Baltimore police to deal with a rash of homicides. \xc2\xa0And I was curious if the President, A, was advised, or that recommendation was brought to be signed off on it. \xc2\xa0What does he think is going on there? \xc2\xa0And in Kenya, and again today, the President has not hesitated to give admonishing words to young Africans in both cases about what they should do to address problems in their own countries. \xc2\xa0Does he have any desire or willingness to go to Baltimore to speak directly to that community that\xe2\x80\x99s in the grip of a historic level of violence?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Major, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that this required a presidential decision. \xc2\xa0The Department of Justice has been working with local officials and local law enforcement officials in Baltimore for some time to help them deal with a variety of challenges that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been confronting, particularly in some predominantly African American neighborhoods in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe commitment of additional resources and manpower to Baltimore is consistent with the kinds of consultations that have been ongoing for some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tCertainly the President is concerned about reports about an uptick in violent crime in Baltimore. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has directed his Department of Justice to continue to be very focused on what steps can be taken not just to strengthen the relationship between local law enforcement and the communities they\xe2\x80\x99re sworn to serve and protect, but also to take some additional steps to try to provide for better law enforcement in that area.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Stan Collender, who is somebody a lot of us pay attention to when it comes to budget matters, has now placed the odds in a government shutdown this fall at 60 percent from where he started a couple of weeks ago at 20 percent. \xc2\xa0I would like to get your assessment of where you think and this administration thinks things are in terms of negotiated settlement ultimately, but the prospect of a shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Major, let me start by saying that Senator McConnell -- Leader McConnell indicated that he did not believe that another shutdown would occur. \xc2\xa0This is something that he expressed some time ago, and he vowed to use his significant influence in the United States Senate to prevent a government shutdown, and we certainly take him at his word. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going to be required is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see Democrats and Republicans in Congress sit down at the negotiating table and try to resolve their differences, and they should do that sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In that context, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw Senator Shelby said over the weekend, Thanksgiving for that. \xc2\xa0How do you react to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that certainly would not be consistent with the promise that was made by Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell to use their new majority in the United States Congress to get Congress moving again. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, there is no reason we should wait until Thanksgiving. \xc2\xa0We know what the issues are, and that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why Democrats and Republicans should follow a template that has resulted in important agreements in the past. \xc2\xa0And that is for Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate to sit down and start trying to find some common ground. \xc2\xa0There are legitimate differences between the two parties, but there should be enough common ground that can be agreed upon to prevent a government shutdown, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a willingness on the part of Democrats to actually have those negotiations, but unfortunately, Republicans have resisted those kinds of talks and it\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible for them to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If Thanksgiving is the landing place, would the President veto CRs to get there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly would not -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it is in the best interest of the country for the most powerful, successful country in the history of the world to be functioning on a budget that lasts month-to-month; that truly there should be a better way for us to run the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0I know that\xe2\x80\x99s the preference. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard and fast rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, right now it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to a CR. \xc2\xa0What should happen is Democrats and Republicans should get together and start working on a longer-term agreement. \xc2\xa0I suppose they can wait until the end of November if -- assuming that there\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of extension passed in the interim period. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change between now and Thanksgiving, so why not go ahead and sit down and have these discussions now, and get this problem out of the way? \xc2\xa0That certainly would be in the best interest of our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Xi Jinping will be here in September for a state visit. \xc2\xa0There are reports -- and they may have just popped up before you came out, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of this, work on it if you could -- that Ling Wancheng, who was purged in an anti-corruption move in China, has stayed here in the United States and the Chinese government has launched a formal request to have him sent back to China. \xc2\xa0This is regarded as a complicating -- one of many complicating factors in the U.S.-China relationship. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us whether or not there has been any formal request from the Chinese government along these lines and if this is merited?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific request but let me take that question and see if we can get you a more formal response.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Just back on Iran for a moment. \xc2\xa0Some of the groups that are opposing the deal have announced pretty elaborate plans to go to congressional districts and air advertising there during the recess to try and advocate -- build up opposition against the deal. \xc2\xa0What is the President planning to do once all the members have left town? \xc2\xa0You noted senators are still here, but House members are back in their districts. \xc2\xa0Will he be traveling to make the case for the deal? \xc2\xa0Is the White House planning anything localized to try and counter the drumbeat of opposition in districts and states during the recess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Julie, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President has had a pretty high profile on these issues over the last couple of weeks, and the President is planning a significant speech later this week, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss this issue and elevate some of the arguments that the President believes are central to any sort of decision on this agreement. \xc2\xa0To put it bluntly, the President believes that Congress should be supportive of an international effort to resolve -- well, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon through diplomacy. \xc2\xa0And no one has put forward a legitimate workable alternative other than raising the prospect of using the military option. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the President has been clear that the military option has always been on the table and it will continue to be. \xc2\xa0But if we have an opportunity to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon using diplomacy, the President believes that we should seize that opportunity. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why over the last two years, or nearly two years, the President and senior members of his team, have spent so much time and effort trying to reach this agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is pleased that his team was able to work effectively with the international community to unite the international community, to present a united front to Iran, and get Iran to make commitments to reduce their nuclear stockpile by 98 percent, to remove 13,000 centrifuges and to render harmless their heavy-water reactor in Arak, and to submit to the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to ensure they\xe2\x80\x99re living up to the commitments that they made in the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of the argument and that is what we hope that not just Americans across the country will find persuasive but what individual members of Congress will find persuasive. \xc2\xa0And the President has given speeches, the President convened a conference call last week, where he talked with grassroots activists all across the country about this agreement to get them energized about this agreement to make sure that they understand the terms of the deal. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make that case and we are confident that a sizeable number of members of Congress will put politics aside and focus on what they believe is in the best interest of the United States and our national security. \xc2\xa0And if they do, a substantial number of those who follow that path will be supportive of the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you been encouraging Democrats who are supportive or who are coming onboard, as you put it earlier, to publicize that support as quickly as possible to try to build the momentum in support of the deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly welcome those public expressions of support but each individual member of Congress will take the time that they need to consider very carefully this agreement to receive a handful of briefings. \xc2\xa0Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s briefings in a classified setting or open testimony or even private meetings with the President of the United States, members of Congress have a variety of ways to understand exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the agreement and to understand what impact this agreement would have on national security and understand exactly how it will strengthen the hand of the United States and strengthen our national security. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make that case, and it certainly is understandable that members of Congress are going to take their time in considering the agreement, considering the information that they have taken in, maybe even consult with some of their constituents before announcing their position. \xc2\xa0But we certainly welcome the important expressions of public support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already received.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned put politics aside, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging members to do. \xc2\xa0Do you think the Democrats who are on the fence are motivated by political concerns or are they worried about political considerations and not the substance of the deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that there is intense political pressure on both sides of this agreement, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that people will do is put aside that political pressure and focus on the specific terms of the agreement. \xc2\xa0And, again, if you look squarely at the agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in place, these significant curbs on the Iranian nuclear program, the unprecedented level of inspections to which the Iranian nuclear program would be subjected, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that this is the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the national security interest of the United States; it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the national security interest of our closest ally in the region, Israel; and it\xe2\x80\x99s good for our partners in the Middle East like the GCC countries. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that the President will make and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a case that many members of Congress will be receptive to.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0May I follow up? \xc2\xa0Not long after President Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s American University commencement address, a partial nuclear test ban treaty was signed that summer by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in Moscow -- that was August 5th. \xc2\xa0U.S. ratification occurred in the U.S. Senate a few weeks later on the 24th of September. \xc2\xa0The treaty was signed by President Kennedy on October 7th, and the treaty went into effect on October 10th. \xc2\xa0Is this the kind of rapid action that President Obama is hoping for as a result of his American University address on the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, JC, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99ve done your homework in terms of that timeline. \xc2\xa0What I would say is that we hope that we would be able to move forward with implementing this agreement soon. \xc2\xa0Congress has 60 days to consider this agreement and we are going to, of course, give them those full 60 days to do their work. \xc2\xa0The United Nations Security Council, the members of the -- including all of the members of the P5+1 who negotiated this agreement -- voted in favor of moving forward with this agreement, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a 90-day period before the agreement will begin to be implemented. \xc2\xa0But after that, we would anticipate that we would move quickly to implement it, and that starts, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you, with Iran taking verifiable steps to curb their nuclear program before they receive any sort of sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the kinds of steps that we want to see in the short term are laid out in the agreement, and they involve Iran reducing their nuclear stockpile by 98 percent, removing 13,000 centrifuges, rendering harmless their heavy-water reactor at Arak, and beginning to comply with the basic -- beginning to comply with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And that also includes giving the IAEA the access to the information that they need to complete their report about the possible military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we need to see Iran comply in the short term before any sort of sanctions relief is given, but we hope to see Iran begin to take those steps within the next couple of months.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President will be making this case on Wednesday at AU?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This will certainly be an important part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s case. \xc2\xa0And since you mentioned President Kennedy, I think the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant here are two things that come to mind. \xc2\xa0The first is there are some who are critics of the deal who have worried that it\xe2\x80\x99s somehow not wise to engage in these kinds of conversations with a country like Iran, with whom we have such significant concerns. \xc2\xa0The fact is, we do have significant concerns with Iran. \xc2\xa0This is an agreement that is not based on trust but rather is based on our ability to verify their compliance with the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is, as the President himself as often said, you don\xe2\x80\x99t enter into these kinds of agreements with your friends. \xc2\xa0You have to resolve these kinds of differences with your adversaries. \xc2\xa0And given Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism, the way that they continue to menace Israel, the way that they continue to unjustly detain some Americans inside of Iran, that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the long list of concerns we have with Iran; that\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason we need to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll illustrate, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out -- and I think this is something that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a little bit more about over the course of this week -- the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s different about the agreement that the P5+1, the United States and our international partners, have struck with Iran, and the agreement that was struck between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Kennedy era is President Kennedy signed up the United States to make some significant concessions as a part of the agreement -- that there were significant reductions in U.S. nuclear activity that was a part of that agreement. \xc2\xa0That ultimately was an agreement that was in the best interest of our national security. \xc2\xa0The difference is, in the case of our negotiation with Iran, the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to make any concessions. \xc2\xa0This is about the Iranian regime significantly rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program and agreeing to a whole set of inspections that will verify their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States, after all, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to make any concessions. \xc2\xa0And I think, again, that should serve -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a useful way for us to illustrate the wisdom of this approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President see any similarities between Mr. Khrushchev and the Ayatollah?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a historical analogy that I would hesitate to comment on.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Getting back to the climate announcement that the President is going to make, I know you talked about this a little earlier with Josh, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that this will get tied up in the courts? \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it very likely that this is going to get tied up in the courts? \xc2\xa0Opponents of the Clean Air rules on mercury and other toxins -- that went all the way to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that this is just going to get tied up until the end of the Obama administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, I have no doubt that special interests and the politicians who are in their pockets will fight tooth and nail against this specific rule. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, this is a step in the right direction when it comes to strengthening our economy, improving public health and finally confronting the carbon pollution that leads to climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it could get tied up to the extent that this rule may not go into effect -- these regulations may not go into effect.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the special interests will make that argument, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also confident in the legal power of our arguments. \xc2\xa0And as you pointed out, there is a clear track record of how the Clean Air Act has been used in the past to implement regulations that are clearly in the best interests of our country and in the best interests of our economy, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out. \xc2\xa0One of the common arguments that we\xe2\x80\x99re most likely to hear from opponents is a suggestion that using the Clean Air Act in this way will have negative consequences for our economy. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, since the Clean Air Act went into place in the mid-1970s, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced pollution by 70 percent but the size of the U.S. economy has tripled. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of skepticism on the part of anybody who is paying attention when confronted with arguments that these kinds of thoughtful, flexible but common-sense rules are somehow not in the best interest of the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, our economy has done well when we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken wise and prudent steps to protect the environment in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s also good for our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Immigration also got stopped in its tracks. \xc2\xa0Those executive actions have not been put into effect because of legal challenges -- another legacy item that the President just is not going to see realized. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that this climate plan may be put in that same box?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I think that there is a clear legal justification for these rules. \xc2\xa0In fact, this is authority that the President is using that was given to the administration by Congress in the Clean Air Act. \xc2\xa0And this is authority that has been exercised by previous members of -- by previous administrations on a number of occasions. \xc2\xa0And, again, we continue to have a lot of confidence that the effective implementation of these rules, by working closely with states and giving them the flexibility that they need to tailor an approach that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the needs of the citizens in their states, is in the best interest of the United States, the best interest of our economy, and the best interest of our planet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And getting back to Ling Wancheng -- has he been in touch with the U.S. government?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on this particular matter but we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You have no information on this matter? \xc2\xa0Were you aware of this report when you walked out into this briefing room?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did not see this report before I walked out here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, so you\xe2\x80\x99re just not aware of it. \xc2\xa0And getting back to Vice President Biden, do you have any observations on how that would affect this race and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign? \xc2\xa0There are so many former members of this administration, this White House team who went to work for Hillary Clinton. \xc2\xa0If Vice President Biden were to get into the race, it would just undoubtedly change the dynamic of the race for the Democratic nomination. \xc2\xa0Do you have any thoughts on that? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not really. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be helpful here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President selected a team of rivals, and we may have a team of rivals running for President. \xc2\xa0Right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess it would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Team Rivals 2, or something. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Having worked on one successful campaign for the presidency, one of the recipes for success is focusing on the race at hand and on the things that you can actually control. \xc2\xa0And it sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that the Clinton campaign is pursuing, and it is in their best interest to not be focused on which candidates may or may not get in the race, but actually to focus on the candidate that you\xe2\x80\x99re working for and articulating his or her vision for the future of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that the Clinton campaign has said that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a wise approach. \xc2\xa0And again, they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take any advice from me, but that certainly is an approach that served the Obama campaign quite well in 2007 and 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Advice that you put into practice running against Hillary Clinton at that time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s one relevant observation, I suppose.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But getting back to the Vice President, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not sending any signals at all that his entry would be unwelcome in any way, shape or form.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the signal that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to send is that the Vice President has earned the right to make a decision for himself on his own timeline about whether or not to pursue a campaign for the presidency in 2016. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, when the President chose Vice President Biden to be his Vice President, he described it at the time, and many times since, that it was the smartest decision that he had made in politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s because the Vice President has been uniquely suited for this role. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that had a long career as a fighter for the middle class. \xc2\xa0He is somebody who, as the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, developed important relationships with world leaders, and has used those relationships to advance the interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so whether it is working with leaders in Iraq or the leaders of Ukraine, or other countries in Latin America, the Vice President has been a very effective advocate for U.S. interests all around the globe. \xc2\xa0That was true when he was in the Senate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been true as Vice President.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat gives him a very unique set of skills and experience. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that there are people who are talking about this possibility. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, when you have that kind of stature within the party, you\xe2\x80\x99re afforded the opportunity to weigh this decision and to announce it on your own timeframe. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the Vice President is doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone around the horn on this next item quite a bit, and I just -- to ask the question, it seems that part of the reason why there\xe2\x80\x99s so much talk and speculation about Vice President Biden running for President is because of this issue of the emails and Secretary Clinton; that it is just such a headache and such a concern inside the Democratic Party that that has given some life to the speculation. \xc2\xa0Agree with that, disagree with that? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I disagree with that, principally because there were a lot of people speculating about the possibility of a Biden presidency long before anybody knew what Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email address was. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to go back to the Syria issue -- to be clear, you said that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t struck the regime in response to attacks against your allies in Syria, but you have defended your allies against attacks from al Nusra, is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make clear is that we have not detected at this point an attack, or any interference, by the Assad regime in the activities of our counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that would be the reason why it has not been necessary for the coalition to take any strikes against the Assad regime, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear to the Assad regime that they should not interfere with our counter-ISIL activities inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0That was an admonition that we articulated at the beginning of our counter-ISIL campaign inside of Syria last fall, and that admonition at the time applied to airstrikes that the United States and our coalition partners were taking against extremist targets inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that admonition certainly applies to the counter-ISIL ground forces that have been trained and equipped by the United States and our coalition partners and are currently operating inside of Syria against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on a separate but related issue, an independent monitoring group has said that it believes 459 civilians have died in U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you think that -- does the White House believe that that death toll is credible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Andrew, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that particularly analysis but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense on this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, two different subjects. \xc2\xa0When it comes to Iran, you\xe2\x80\x99re tallying votes here at the White House, and it\xe2\x80\x99s suspected that you -- from administration officials -- that you have enough votes to sustain a veto. \xc2\xa0What is your tally so far? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific vote count to share with you. \xc2\xa0As you know, there are still many members of Congress who are deciding what their final vote will be on this. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe put -- one reason that we have projected a substantial amount of confidence in our ability to sustain a veto, at least in the House, is that back in May, there were about 150 or so House Democrats -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the letter in front of me; it\xe2\x80\x99s about 150 House Democrats -- who have indicated that they are -- that they at the time were supportive of an effort to reach a final agreement consistent with the parameters established in the political agreement that was announced the first week in April.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what you now know, since we announced the details of the comprehensive final agreement, is that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t just meet the standard that was set in Lausanne in the context of the political agreement, we actually exceeded it. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we have made to members of the House Democratic Caucus, in particular, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to be confident that we\xe2\x80\x99d be able to sustain a presidential veto in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat being said, we clearly are not taking any of those votes for granted. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen senior administration officials, including the President, participate in classified hearings -- or classified briefings in -- open hearings before relevant committees, and even in private meetings with the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what do you do for those Senate Democrats who feel they have six weeks to carefully look through this Iran deal? \xc2\xa0I know it\xe2\x80\x99s nail-biting here and you want an answer quickly, but how do you handle those senators who may wait up until the very last minute -- the 11th hour, 59 minutes and 59 seconds -- to make their decision? \xc2\xa0How do you handle those Democrats in the Senate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, I think our approach has been characterized by a desire to provide them with as much information as they feel they need to make their decision. \xc2\xa0Our operating assumption here has been that the more information that we can provide about the agreement, the more likely that people are to support it. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s simply because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of confidence in what was negotiated by Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz, Secretary Lew and others who are responsible for reaching this agreement, not just with Iran but with the broader international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on my second subject, I want to go back to Major\xe2\x80\x99s question on Baltimore. \xc2\xa0And primarily, when you have a police department that is accused of deliberately slowing down actively working crimes, and then you\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring in federal agents, is there some kind of quandary there? \xc2\xa0And do you think that the Justice Department should look at a possible police shakeup of that department if they are actively accused of deliberately slowing down responding and dealing with crimes in that city that has seen a number of violent crimes and homicides rise to record numbers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April, what I can tell you is that the Department of Justice is, and has been for some time, interested in working closely with officials in Baltimore, both elected political leaders but also local law enforcement officers, to provide for the needs of the people of the city of Baltimore. \xc2\xa0And we did see a pretty significant rupture in the relationship between local law enforcement in some communities inside of Baltimore, and there have been consequences for that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the Department of Justice has officials at the Department of -- has officials who have a lot of experience in trying to repair those kinds of relationships, and to try to make sure that local officials and local law enforcement officials can meet the need of the people in those communities. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re actively trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that assistance takes a variety of forms. \xc2\xa0So for some more details about what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re doing at the Department of Justice to help the people of Baltimore and to help the city of Baltimore meet the needs of the people in that city, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them. \xc2\xa0But this certainly is something that they\xe2\x80\x99re committed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does this White House find it acceptable, three months after that riot at Freddie Gray\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, that the police are deliberately slowing down actively working crimes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some reports about that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have facts to back up that accusation.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about clean power. \xc2\xa0Can you assure the American people -- I looked at a lot of the numbers and they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty impressive, but can you ensure the American people that their basic energy costs won\xe2\x80\x99t go up in the wake of this particular coup by the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, what we have seen and what our analysis shows is that as the Clean Power Plan is implemented, we will see individual states and individual utilities ramp up their investments in efficiency, ramp up their investments in renewable energy, which is cheaper to produce than energy that\xe2\x80\x99s produced by coal. \xc2\xa0And making those kinds of investments will lead to savings in the utility bills of customers down the line. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, both in terms of saving consumers money, but also a whole set of benefits that are associated with shifting to renewable energy, or the use of less energy. \xc2\xa0And that means fewer cases of asthma, fewer asthma attacks. \xc2\xa0It means accelerating the already-burgeoning clean-energy industry that exists in this country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going to lead to greater economic growth and more job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a really important opportunity for us to seize here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of this agreement moving forward, to say nothing of how important it is for us to take tangible steps to fight carbon pollution and the causes of climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You might, however, see how people in West Virginia, for example, and Kentucky and other places that would be severely impacted by a major economic shift like that -- what do you say to people who live in these places who rely on those energies -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, those jobs, from that particular industry?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, what we have seen is that for more than a decade we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a decline in the coal industry. \xc2\xa0And the fact is that using coal to power -- to generate power is more expensive than a number of alternatives, including natural gas. \xc2\xa0And that has had a negative impact on the coal industry. \xc2\xa0Just as one piece of -- one illustration here, there have actually been more jobs lost in the coal industry under Presidents Reagan and Clinton than there have been under President Obama. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I use that example to illustrate that this is a much broader trend that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the course of decades and not a phenomenon that has emerged just since Barack Obama was elected President. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you asked a relevant question, which is what is the administration doing about it. \xc2\xa0And, Kevin, we can get you some more details on this, but I would point you to -- at the end of last year, the administration rolled out something called the POWER Plus plan, and this was essentially a $10 billion package of incentives that would focus directly on workers in coal country -- those communities that rely on the coal industry and have for generations, particularly in places like West Virginia and Kentucky.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what this $10 billion would do is invest in things like job training and job creation to try to help those workers transition away from an industry that is facing some pretty stiff economic headwinds, and in the direction of better economic opportunities. \xc2\xa0It also would include a specific investment in the health and retirement security of those workers. \xc2\xa0We obviously know that working in the coal industry is one that can take a toll on a worker\xe2\x80\x99s health and job security and retirement security. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve made investments in that area as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the administration is serious about helping the coal industry and the workers that rely on the coal industry transition into an industry that has better long-term prospects.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Couple more -- one on Syria, one on Iran. \xc2\xa0On Iran, any update on the Americans that have been detained there unlawfully?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just, Kevin, to assure you and those who have been very keenly focused on the well-being of those Americans, that our efforts to obtain their release are ongoing. \xc2\xa0And the President himself indicated that this was a top priority, and that continues to be true even today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And in Syria, can you assure the American people that this country is not engaged in a proxy war against the Assad regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I mentioned to Andrew, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that the United States and our coalition partners are committed to using military force where necessary to protect the coalition-trained-and-equipped Syrian opposition fighters that are operating against ISIL inside of Syria right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have done is we have admonished the Assad regime to not interfere with our ongoing counter-ISIL efforts inside of Syria, and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just mean not interfering with our air campaign inside of Syria that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for almost a year now, but also not to interfere in the efforts of our -- of the coalition-trained-and-equipped fighters that are operating against ISIL in Syria right now. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken some steps that make sure -- to provide for the safety and security of those opposition fighters and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a proxy war? \xc2\xa0You can say that definitively?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yeah. \xc2\xa0And primarily because we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps to defend those fighters. \xc2\xa0But we have, so far, seen the Assad regime abide by the admonishment that we have offered to not interfere with our activities inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tLinsey.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0So back to Iran just for a moment. \xc2\xa0You can just reiterate again -- were you saying that President Obama does feel today confident that he has enough votes to sustain his veto?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Linsey, we do feel confident that when -- that if faced with the choice of sustaining the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto of a resolution of disapproval, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough support in the House of Representatives to sustain that veto.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we don\xe2\x80\x99t take those votes for granted, and there certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t been a sufficient number of House Democrats who have come forward publicly to say that that\xe2\x80\x99s what their position would be. \xc2\xa0But we do put a lot of stock in the commitment that was made by enough House Democrats to sustain a veto in the form of that letter that they signed back in May that indicated their support for a comprehensive agreement that reflected the outlines of the political agreement that was reached in Lausanne in early April.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have since indicated, since that letter was signed and delivered, is that we actually have a comprehensive agreement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just meet the parameters of the Lausanne agreement; our comprehensive agreement actually exceeds those parameters in a couple of ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does the President believe that the Vice President would be a good President? \xc2\xa0And does he believe that Hillary Clinton would be equally a good President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into rating the qualifications of any candidates or possible candidates. \xc2\xa0But I think the President has indicated that one of the reasons that he chose Joe Biden to be his running mate and to be the Vice President of the United States is that he thinks that he would be a good President. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that. \xc2\xa0But I would also point out that the President has spoken warmly of others who have served in his administration, including Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo ultimately, it will be the responsibility of Democratic voters all across the country to decide who they believe would be the best Democratic nominee for President. \xc2\xa0And the President will have the opportunity to vote in the Illinois primary, but at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any public endorsement decisions that the President\xe2\x80\x99s made. \xc2\xa0But if the President has decided to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, what does the administration make out of the last round of negotiations in Hawaii for the Trans-Pacific Partnership? \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that this is going to stumble after a long fight on the domestic front?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0What we are focused on, and what Ambassador Froman is focused on, is making sure that the final TPP agreement is one that sets -- that meets the criteria that the President has laid out. \xc2\xa0And that criteria is specifically that it enhances the economic prospects of middle-class families here in the United States, but also enhances the national security interests of the United States around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of agreement that the President has directed his team to try to broker. \xc2\xa0And the President has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign onto an agreement that falls short of that standard. \xc2\xa0And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly surprising to me that there might be some in other countries who are suggesting that the United States has not moven far enough in their direction. \xc2\xa0Principally, you can expect Ambassador Froman and others who are negotiating this agreement to be strong advocates for the United States and for our economy and for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is, is that there should be -- there should be some common ground where we can reach an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of consumers in another country, while at the same time being clearly in the best interests of the United States and our economy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the common ground that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hard at work at trying to find for several years now.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I think -- the President has, on a number of occasions, demonstrated a willingness to both walk away from the negotiating table or to bolt past deadlines to make sure that these kinds of agreements are clearly in the best interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0And whether that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the thing that comes to mind most readily is the trip that the President took to South Korea in the fall of 2010. \xc2\xa0And the expectation of many was that would be the place where the President and his team would complete a trade agreement with the Republic of Korea, and those of you who traveled on that trip remembered that we got a lot of bad press because that agreement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done. \xc2\xa0And the suggestion was that the President had somehow fallen short and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the international juice that he needed to have to complete that agreement. \xc2\xa0But about a year later, we completed an agreement, and that was an indication that the President was willing to endure a little criticism, even in the media -- in the short in pursuit of a longer-term agreement that is clearly in the best interest of our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You fielded a question last week about how domestic politics in some of the member nations, specifically Canada, might affect something like Keystone. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that domestic politics in Canada, the upcoming election there, is affecting the TPP negotiations in a negative way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what impact the Canadian political situation is having on the Canadian negotiators. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody at the USTR that does. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you about it publicly, but you can give it a shot.</p>\n<p>\n\tEdwin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a quick question about immigration. \xc2\xa0Even though this administration has broken records in the deportation of undocumented immigrants, the number of undocumented has stayed steady -- 11.3 million. \xc2\xa0Now, the White House website says that undocumented immigrants last stopped growing in the last decade. \xc2\xa0How can we say that if the number is still over 11 million?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Edwin, what the President announced when it came to his executive actions on immigration reform at the end of last year is that he wanted to make our immigration system more accountable and to add some much-needed accountability to our broken immigration system. \xc2\xa0And what that means is it meant focusing our law enforcement resources on those individuals who came to this country and posed a threat to this country, or to communities inside this country. \xc2\xa0That principally means going after those who perpetrated acts of violence, and making sure that those individuals are promptly deported; that we should be focused on felons and not on separating families that in some cases have been in the United States for a decade or longer.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President made an aggressive case that Congress should act decisively to bring some much-needed accountability to our broken immigration system, and allow those who have been in this country for some time, who have tried to contribute to our country in a positive way by getting a job and trying to provide for their families, that one of the things that we can do is actually bring them out of the shadows and make them undergo a background check and put them in a situation where they can pay taxes again. \xc2\xa0And this would actually be good for our economy, it would be good for economic growth, but it also would make the immigration system more fair and a better reflection of the kinds of values that are critically important in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President did using his executive action. \xc2\xa0But ultimately what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see is we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress take that kind of common-sense action that previously won some bipartisan for it, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to build it again.</p>\n<p>\n\tJessica, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just to get more clarity on the Clean Power Plan with respect to how it relates to Paris and the climate talks there. \xc2\xa0I know on the call there was this sense of this being part of building momentum. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about how these specific targets relate to what the U.S. and other major polluting economies want to see happen in Paris?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jessica, you know that we have had a lot of success in getting other countries to make significant commitments alongside the United States when we make important domestic commitments when it comes to reducing carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0So the President traveled to China last November, where he announced a significant commitment on the part of the United States to reduce carbon pollution in this country, and he was met with a similar commitment by President Xi to cap carbon emissions in China on or around 2030. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what that would require on the part of the Chinese is a historic investment in renewable energy on the scale that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen before. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that means it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant commitment that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the Chinese government but also is the kind of commitment that opens up significant economic opportunity for U.S. businesses, particularly those U.S. businesses that are looking to do business in the renewable energy industry inside of China. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of how we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously been able to leverage domestic commitments in the United States to broader international commitments by other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe saw a similar dynamic when President Rousseff of Brazil visited the White House, where both Presidents made a commitment to reduce carbon emissions. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen similar commitments from places like Mexico, which agreed to cap their carbon pollution in 2026. \xc2\xa0We saw commitments from India when it comes to the deployment of renewable energy technology. \xc2\xa0We also saw a significant commitment in just the last month or so from South Korea. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there is building momentum toward the climate talks in Paris. \xc2\xa0And I do think you can expect that the United States will seek to use this significant domestic commitment that the President announced today to leverage a commitment from other countries and even advance the talks in December.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so how would it affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s credibility and his representatives in Paris if this whole thing is undermined by industry groups and legislators who oppose it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jessica, we continue to be confident in the legal authority that the President was given by the United States Congress in the Clean Air Act to implement these rules in this way. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s why the administration has gone to great lengths to try to be flexible in working with states to implement these rules. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that what the administration will do is set targets for individual states, but ultimately individual states can devise their own plan for meeting those targets. \xc2\xa0And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that those states could spend most of the next year putting that plan together and submitting it to the federal government.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have done is essentially given them a two-year extension in implementing those rules. \xc2\xa0The proposed rule that we put forward was that the plans needed to begin being implemented in 2020, and what the final rule indicates is that states now don\xe2\x80\x99t have to begin implementing those plans until 2022. \xc2\xa0So they can use those two years to sort or refine and plan for the effective implementation of those strategies.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s notable is that what we have not done is taken away incentives for states to make early investments in clean energy; that our policy folks are calling this essentially a head start for renewable energy and for energy efficiency. \xc2\xa0So if we see that states are making a commitment and implementing renewable energy technology or energy efficiency technology in their states in 2020, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get the benefit of making those investments even though they\xe2\x80\x99re not required to begin implementing their plans until 2022.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I cite that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a little complicated -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of our desire to work effectively with states and to give states alto of support and incentive to begin to seriously commit to the implementation of these rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one other question on the renewables aspect, which is -- yesterday on the call, Administrator McCarthy mentioned how part of the economic argument of the opposition has been undermined by the fact that renewables prices are coming down. \xc2\xa0And part of that is due to global competition from solar panel manufacturers around the world, including China. \xc2\xa0And I wonder if the White House recognizes that some of the economic incentives behind what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do have been supported by some of the advances of other countries in this regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are two things that come to mind on this. \xc2\xa0The first is that part of the commitment that China made to cleaner energy production was an investment in nuclear technology -- essentially technology for nuclear power plants. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of U.S. companies that are the industry leader in that field. \xc2\xa0And that does open up really important business opportunities in China for American companies, and that means a good opportunity to expand economic growth and job creation right here in the United States because of opportunities that exist in China.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you recognize the reverse?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do recognize the reverse. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s principally because of those competitive forces that the President has made the case that that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States needs to get serious about accelerating the kind of investment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far in renewable energy. \xc2\xa0Obviously, because of the commitment that China has made to cap their carbon pollution in 2030, that means that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a significant investment in renewable energy technology. \xc2\xa0And if the United States wants to keep pace, we need to make sure that we see a sustained investment in this country and in this economy, too.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd one of the benefits of this rule -- and I think this is sort of going back to the beginning of the briefing -- I think this is one of the things that some industry leaders actually like about this proposal is it does give them some certainty. \xc2\xa0That right now, if you\xe2\x80\x99re an investor in the energy field, that you can look at these rules and say, well, this is a serious commitment that every state across the country is going to have to make to implementing this plan and investing in renewable energy by 2030. \xc2\xa0That means, as a private sector investor trying to determine whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a market for renewable goods in this country, that you can be confident that your kind of investment has an opportunity to succeed because you know that states all across the country are invested in implementing this technology. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going to create a whole new market.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the truth is, in the last several years we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen U.S. investment in U.S. companies perform very well in this sector, but we believe that those investments can essentially be turbocharged by making a significant long-term investment to that kind of technology.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:01 P.M.
