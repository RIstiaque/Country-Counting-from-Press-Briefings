Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I do not have any statements to do at the top, so we can go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to first start with the Putin meeting in New York next week. \xc2\xa0Can you give us a little context for what we should be expecting out of this meeting? \xc2\xa0Does the President see it as a meeting that could result in some agreements between he and Putin on Syria and Ukraine, or does he see it as an opportunity to kind of take Putin\xe2\x80\x99s temperature on both of these issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Julie, President Obama does look forward to meeting with President Putin -- at his request, at President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s request -- next week. \xc2\xa0Both presidents will be attending the U.N. \xc2\xa0The precise date of their meeting is still something we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to resolve before the end of the day today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Russians said Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know whether or not we can confirm that on our end. \xc2\xa0But when the President sits down with President Putin, the top item on his agenda will be Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And President Obama will once again use this occasion to reinforce to President Putin the importance of Russia keeping the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the context of the Minsk agreements. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a message that President Putin has heard from some of our European allies who have raised concerns with the way that combined Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine continue to destabilize that country, and they continue to receive important military support from the Russian government. \xc2\xa0That is a clear violation of the territorial integrity of that sovereign nation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the impact of the coordinated action of the United States and our allies on Russia as a result of those activities are not insignificant. \xc2\xa0They have contributed to a significant weakening of the Russian economy just over the last couple of years since those sanctions were put in place. \xc2\xa0The IMF projects that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy will contract 3 to 4 percent this year, and will stay in a recession next year. \xc2\xa0The Russian economy in 2013 was measured at one-eighth the size of the United States [as] the ninth-largest economy in the world. \xc2\xa0In 2015, the Russian economy is just one-sixteenth of the size of the U.S. economy, and is now just the fifteenth in the world -- one rung below Spain on the ladder. \xc2\xa0The Russian Central Bank, since the start of the crisis in eastern Ukraine, has lost around $150 billion in reserves. \xc2\xa0And both S&amp;P and Moody\xe2\x80\x99s have downgraded Russia\xe2\x80\x99s credit rating to junk status. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is clear that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s international isolation and their continued refusal to abide by basic international norms, particularly when it comes to these combined Russian separatist forces, has taken a significant toll on their economy. \xc2\xa0And this will be at the top of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda when the two Presidents sit down in New York next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And yet despite everything that you just listed there, they\xe2\x80\x99re not actually changing their behavior in Ukraine, nor has Putin really been deterred, it seems, from moving military personnel and weaponry into Syria. \xc2\xa0So as it relates to Syria, you guys -- your public stance has basically been that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing there. \xc2\xa0When the President meets with Putin privately, what is his message going to be? \xc2\xa0Where do we stand in terms of possible U.S.-Russian military cooperation on Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think in this regard the President\xe2\x80\x99s public message will be quite similar -- or private message will be quite similar to the message that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him deliver publicly, which is President Obama will make clear once again that Russia doubling down on their support for the Assad regime is a losing bet. \xc2\xa0The likely consequence of them doing so is only to deepen and expand the ongoing crisis in that country that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve the interests of either the Russian people or the American people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama will encourage President Putin to consider constructive contributions to the ongoing counter-ISIL effort. \xc2\xa0There are more than 60 nations that are involved in implementing a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the Russians make a constructive contribution to that ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would just note that these kinds of concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s stepped-up military involvement in Syria are not at all inconsistent with some of the concerns that I know Prime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to raise when he traveled to Moscow -- I believe it was earlier this week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I guess, finally, on this -- do you worry or was it considered at all that by having this meeting -- which seems like it\'s going to be in a much more formal way than some of the sideline conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had over the last year or two -- that this thickens your argument that you are isolating Putin on the world stage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I think -- well, you do raise an important point about sort of the length of time it\'s last been since the two leaders sat down in a formal way. \xc2\xa0There have been a couple of conversations around -- the President last spoke to President Putin in July to discuss the completion of the P5+1 agreement with Iran. \xc2\xa0And in the context of that call, the President rightfully acknowledged the constructive way that Russia had participated in those multilateral talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey had spoken a month earlier than that, back in June, to discuss the situation in Ukraine, which the President raised some of the concerns that I\'ve just outlined. \xc2\xa0And they had face-to-face interactions last fall, I believe both at the G20 and at APEC.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is the first opportunity that the two leaders will have had to sit down in a formal way to discuss some of these issues. \xc2\xa0And, look, President Putin requested the meeting, and I think at this point, considering the significant concerns that I have just raised, I think it makes sense for President Obama to sit down with his counterpart and see if he can get some greater clarity about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s intentions inside of Ukraine and whether or not they are going to begin to take steps to abide by the commitments that they have made but failed to live up to in the context of Ukraine, and whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to at least consider President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advice when it comes to reinforcing their military support for the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned that by giving him the meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99s requesting and giving him sort of the photo-op portion of it, I assume, that you\'re weakening this isolation aspect of what\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be punishment for Ukraine?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not at all. \xc2\xa0And there will be -- the fact is -- I mean, I chronicled the toll that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s international isolation has taken on the domestic economy over there. \xc2\xa0And that\'s not going to change because of one in-person conversation. \xc2\xa0But a meeting like this does have the potential for giving the United States greater insight into exactly what Russia\xe2\x80\x99s intentions are. \xc2\xa0That insight is not likely to be gleaned based on one conversation, but it could lay the groundwork -- it could potentially lay the groundwork for better coordination. \xc2\xa0I think that remains to be seen, but at least it\'s a proposition worth testing.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve emphasized in your remarks that President Putin requested the meeting. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering, if in the long period of time between the two leaders meeting, whether President Putin had requested other meetings that the White House or the President had turned down.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I probably won\xe2\x80\x99t chronicle the meetings that didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur. \xc2\xa0But I would note that in the June call that the President placed to discuss Ukraine with President Putin, we noted in the readout that that was also a telephone call that President Putin had requested.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in the attention of the leader of the United States of America. \xc2\xa0And given the lengthy list of concerns that we have about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in a couple of these international hotspots, a face-to-face sit-down seems appropriate at this juncture.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s about a week to go before a potential government shutdown, and we saw the veto threat this morning. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could outline for us or update us on what efforts the White House has been making just in the past day or so, if any, to avert the shutdown. \xc2\xa0Is there something that the White House is doing to sort of move things forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t detail all of the conversations that may have taken place between the White House and Capitol Hill, but I can confirm for you that there were -- that there have been conversations between White House officials and members of Congress up on Capitol Hill to discuss the need to avoid a government shutdown and to ensure that the sequester is not locked in, and that there\xe2\x80\x99s eventual bipartisan agreement around an effort to adequately fund both our national security and economic priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the White House is worried at all or concerned at all about the optics of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit overshadowing the President of China\xe2\x80\x99s visit tomorrow. \xc2\xa0Are you worried about that having any impact on sort of the diplomatic goals that you hope to achieve?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not heard anybody raise that concern. \xc2\xa0I think the sense is, is that this is a week that we have long identified as being one filled with a lot of intensive diplomacy, and that includes not just welcoming the Pope to the White House or hosting President Xi for a state dinner, but also the important work that will be done in New York early next week in the context of the United Nations General Assembly. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in each of those meetings, the President will be considering how the United States can continue to use our international influence to advance our interests around the globe. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we\xe2\x80\x99ll have ample opportunity both over the course of this afternoon but also tomorrow in the context of the formal visit to discuss what interests the United States and China share in common, and how talks can be productive even on those issues where that might be characterized by what you could describe as competition.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thank you. \xc2\xa0Keeping on President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit, there is a sense that a deal is coming together over cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0Can you update us on that effort given that they will in fact be having dinner tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s dinner is essentially the same kind of engagement that was planned when President Obama visited China last fall. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that China hosted APEC, the APEC conference, where nations from around the Asia Pacific traveled to Beijing for a set of multilateral meetings. \xc2\xa0At the end of APEC, President Obama remained in China for another day or two to engage in a series of meetings with his counterpart, and he kicked off those series of bilateral meetings with a private dinner that President Xi hosted for him in Beijing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know the President found that in-person interaction, where sort of outside of the glare of the klieg lights and away from sort of the formality and pomp and circumstance, to be pretty insightful. \xc2\xa0And I think the President, despite the language barrier and some obvious stylistic differences, the President found that to be a useful format for talking about issues that were important to both leaders and to both countries. \xc2\xa0And so the idea here is to try to reciprocate that kind of -- to reciprocate that invitation with one of his own. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President and -- President Obama and President Xi will be having a dinner tonight over in Blair House. \xc2\xa0There will be some other senior U.S. officials there and some other Chinese officials there, but not very many. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a readout at this point, although the two leaders will do a news conference tomorrow, and maybe one of you will choose to ask the Presidents about their private meal. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut our hope is, is that can be a good way to begin what will eventually be a day-long set of meetings to try to advance the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the ultimate goal to get a deal on cybersecurity? \xc2\xa0And has that happened yet? \xc2\xa0Have they reached a deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Certainly, there\xe2\x80\x99s no agreement that I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to talk about at this point. \xc2\xa0But we have made clear to the Chinese, both publicly and privately, that issues related to cybersecurity and our concerns with China\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in cyberspace will feature prominently on the agenda. \xc2\xa0And that will start tonight at the dinner.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that it is clear -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve cited this before -- President Xi a couple of weeks ago dispatched a senior Chinese official, Secretary Meng, to travel to the United States and meet with a variety of U.S. officials, including in law enforcement, the intelligence community, and even here at the White House specifically to address the concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised related to cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And President Xi made some comments in Seattle, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chinese government will not in whatever form engage in commercial theft, in hacking against government networks, crimes that must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 And I wonder what the President makes of those comments? \xc2\xa0Does he feel like President Xi is someone we could trust? \xc2\xa0And if there is, in fact, any type of agreement, does he trust that he will stick to it -- the Chinese will stick to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think this will be a situation where we will pay particular attention to China\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and their conduct, that we put more stock in their actions than their words. \xc2\xa0But obviously those kinds of comments are at least consistent with what we have urged the Chinese to do when it comes to their policies. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, it certainly is not going to eliminate the concerns that we have. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is not going to reduce the priority that we place on trying to make progress on those issues in the context of the meetings that are coming up in the next 36 hours.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one on the refugee crisis. \xc2\xa0The EU summit seems to be devolving. \xc2\xa0Is there more that the United States can and should be doing to help Europe with this crisis? \xc2\xa0And is there any conversation about increasing the number of Syrian refugees that might be let in from the current 10,000 figure?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, there is no -- well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to what we said. \xc2\xa0A couple of weeks ago, we did make clear that the United States, based on a decision made by the President, is prepared to accept at least 10,000 refugees in the next fiscal year. \xc2\xa0And that reflects a significant scaling up of our response. \xc2\xa0And you\'ve heard announcements over the course of this week from Secretary Kerry indicating that the overall level -- or overall number of refugees that we intend to try to move through the process and bring into the United States will increase both in the next fiscal year and the one after that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But just in terms of the Syrians, Josh -- I mean, right now it seems like the urgency is there. \xc2\xa0Why not increase that number?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is a sense of urgency, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why earlier this week I announced that the United States would be committing more than $400 million in additional humanitarian assistance to this ongoing effort. \xc2\xa0And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the most effective way to meet the urgent need of those Syrians who are in such a desperate situation, beefing up that humanitarian response is the most effective way to meet those needs in the near term. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut certainly, over the longer term, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is a continued commitment on the part of European nations to confront the challenges that they face together, and not just rely on contributions and generosity from one or two countries on the continent. \xc2\xa0But ultimately the situation will only be resolved when we can effect the kind of political transition inside of Syria that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s morning. \xc2\xa0Did he get a chance to see the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s speech and his remarks on Capitol Hill? \xc2\xa0And what did he think about them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President did have the opportunity to see at least part of Pope Francis\xe2\x80\x99s remarks to Congress today. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to talk to him about his specific reaction, but I know that he would have been struck by the kind of message that Pope Francis had to deliver not just to the leaders of this country, but to the citizens in this country. \xc2\xa0And Pope Francis made the appropriate observation, I believe, that it was important for the United States to live up to the high standard that we\xe2\x80\x99ve set for ourselves, and that was met by those who came before us.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe cited the examples of people like Dr. King and President Lincoln for the role that they played in shaping our country and the values that guide the leaders of this country. \xc2\xa0So I thought it was a powerful speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to also ask you a bit about China. \xc2\xa0Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s sense that China is helping Russia economically, and in doing so blunting any potential punishment? \xc2\xa0For example, economically -- you sort of listed a number of ways that the U.S. economically has been able to sort of sanction the Russians for their misbehavior in places like Ukraine, and yet it seems like China might be sort of girding them up just a bit. \xc2\xa0Is that your sense? \xc2\xa0And if so, what does that say about China\xe2\x80\x99s respect for our wishes and the wishes of, frankly, many in the international community that the Russians be punished for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in Ukraine?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert on relations between Russia and China. \xc2\xa0I did take note in the last month or so ago that there was an energy contract between Russia and China that would have yielded a significant economic benefit for Russia, and that was cancelled. \xc2\xa0So to the extent that there is any cooperation that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing, it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have been flawless. \xc2\xa0And again, to the extent that there may have been efforts by the Chinese to try to strengthen the Russian economy, based on the statistics that I read earlier it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that their efforts were particularly successful. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, Russia is isolated and their economy has taken a hit as a result of it. \xc2\xa0And as Julie pointed out, rightly, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve admitted this on previous occasions, it has not yet resulted in the kind of change of behavior that we would like to see from the Russians. \xc2\xa0They continue to offer support to these combined Russian separatist forces inside of eastern Ukraine, and that continues to be a source of concern not just to the United States but, in particular, to France and Germany.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see is Russia live up to the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the context of the Minsk agreements. \xc2\xa0And the President has been quite clear since the very first day that these sanctions were imposed that the United States would be prepared to offer relief from those sanctions as soon as there was evidence that Russia was actually following through on what they said they were going to do. \xc2\xa0But we haven\'t seen that so far, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why those sanctions remain in place. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s contributing to the kind of economic weakness that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Russia right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any way to further drive down the value of oil, at least domestically in terms of international supply, to further weaken the Russian economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The global price of energy is one that we have, for a variety of reasons, usually in a much different context, have acknowledged that we here in the U.S. government don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot of control over.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is it\xe2\x80\x99s influenced by such a wide variety of things, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the low price of energy on the global markets has also had a negative impact on the Russian economy. \xc2\xa0And again, those who know more about the energy markets than I do have observed that the increased supply in the United States along with the reduced consumption in the United States have at least played -- been one factor in the declining price.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can stand here and say that our efforts to promote energy efficiency and the production of oil and gas in the United States is directly related to our Russia policy. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it really is; it\xe2\x80\x99s more directly influenced by the U.S. economy and our needs here. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that it has had an impact.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, I want to ask you about an interesting piece in the Times today about intelligence assessments. \xc2\xa0And I know you and I have talked about this previously. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re getting bad information, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t rely on the information, then the veracity of that information, how do you make good decisions? \xc2\xa0How concerned is the President that some of the assessments of not just Iraq but Syria in particular has been faulty, and therefore the policies haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shaped by the right type of information?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I think as that story pointed out, there is an ongoing independent review of some of these intelligence processes. \xc2\xa0But what I have said is -- essentially echoes the point that you have just made, which is the President seeks accurate, up-to-date, timely, robust information about what is exactly happening on the ground in places like Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe kinds of policy decisions that the Commander-in-Chief needs to make are more effective when they are informed by accurate, timely intelligence. \xc2\xa0And the President is deeply appreciative of the work of our intelligence agencies and the intelligence community for the work that they have done to try to bring that information to him and to provide him the kind of keen analysis that he relies on every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there should be no doubt about the appreciation that he has for our intelligence officials, but also the kind of task that he sets before them to bring forward the most accurate, timely information -- even if that information yields bad conclusions. \xc2\xa0Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s bad news, the President wants to know about it so that we can confront it and figure out how to adjust our policy to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re maximizing the impact and benefitting from the desired effect.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What should be the punishment, if you will, and what should be the result if the investigations reveal that a particular person or persons did try to shade or cook the books? \xc2\xa0What does the President believe should happen to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on the specific investigation or what could potentially arise from it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say as a general matter that the President holds the intelligence community to a very high standard because of the importance of their work. \xc2\xa0But I can also say that the work that is done by the intelligence community is work that the President deeply appreciates and has a lot of confidence in.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, good to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nice to see you, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you describe for us what the administration would accept in terms of a CR?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What the administration has -- what the President has made clear is that he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress to take action before September 30th to avoid a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0And he has made clear that he does not want to see the Congress pass legislation that includes ideological riders like the one that is included in this Senate bill. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we would veto this one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has also said that the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to resolve this budget disagreement that exists on Capitol Hill is for Republicans and Democrats to sit down together and to resolve it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would a clean CR be a bridge to that and acceptable to the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly could be. \xc2\xa0And we have in the last couple of -- maybe it was the last week or so -- made clear that the President would be willing to sign a CR that did not include ideological riders for a relatively short period of time --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Essentially maintain the status quo.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- for a short period of time to allow members of Congress to come together and try to reach a bipartisan agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that we would not like to see a CR for a long period of time is it would have the effect of locking in the sequester, which would badly underfund some of our national security priorities and some of our economic priorities. \xc2\xa0But the President has indicated a willingness to tolerate that for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you define that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not specifically, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, considering that negotiations have not really gelled in any way that I can tell, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a couple of weeks at least.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They haven\xe2\x80\x99t gelled any way that we can tell either. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, it would take a couple of weeks it would seem.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So a month? \xc2\xa0You could do it with a month?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t want to set a deadline here at this point. \xc2\xa0But what we have made clear is that we\'re not looking at locking in the sequester. \xc2\xa0And in fact, we would be willing to agree to a short-term extension at current funding levels in order for Congress to reach an agreement that would not lock in the sequester. \xc2\xa0And --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s a precondition.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not setting preconditions here. \xc2\xa0You asked what we are interested in, and we\'re interested in the kind of agreement that would ensure that the national security and economic priorities of this country are adequately funded.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to put a fine point on it, would the President therefore not sign a CR to keep the government open if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- included with that was a pledge from Republicans to engage in negotiations that would lift the sequester, or in some ways give more room for defense and domestic spending than the current sequester limits allow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to offer up any ultimatums from the podium today other than sort of the outlines of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve already established about preventing a government shutdown, adequately funding our economic and national security priorities, making sure that this is not clouded by ideological riders. \xc2\xa0The good news with all of that is I think that those are broad outlines; I would readily concede that. \xc2\xa0But I do think that there is bipartisan agreement about all of that. \xc2\xa0I think that there is a sufficient bipartisan majority that generally supports all that stuff. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would also concede that the devil is in the details in these kinds of things. \xc2\xa0So that\'s why the President would be willing to sign a short-term CR to give Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill the opportunity to work through those details and arrive at the kind of bipartisan budget agreement that would certainly not be perfect in the eyes of anybody, but would fulfill that criteria that I think most members of Congress agree is important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Syria you said that notion of Russia doubling down on behalf of Assad is a losing bet. \xc2\xa0But then you also said the President wants to obtain clarity on what Russia is doing there. \xc2\xa0It sounds like you already decided what Russia is doing there -- doubling down on behalf of Assad. \xc2\xa0I\'m trying to reconcile those two things.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, and I think what we have acknowledged is I think a lot of people have said, well, the fact that Russia is committing these additional military resources into Syria is an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to do more of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve already been doing. \xc2\xa0And what we have said is that there actually does continue to be the potential for Russia to not do that and actually find a way to use their military resources inside of Syria or other places to constructively contribute to the ongoing efforts of our counter-ISIL coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it also possible that Russia is there, that in case there\xe2\x80\x99s a transition of a government they can be there militarily to influence the new government and play a role on the ground that the United States can\'t play?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what is also clear and the other observation that we\'ve made about this --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You think that\xe2\x80\x99s possible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s possible is that Russia is growing increasingly concerned about the fact that their sole remaining client state in the Middle East is descending further and further into chaos, and the autocratic leader that they have propped up in that country for a number of years now is on a downward trajectory, you might say. \xc2\xa0And so they might be concerned that the investment that they have made over the years is something that they\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared to lose, and so they are scrambling to try to shore up that investment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they could be doing that with an eye toward the future -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that. \xc2\xa0But I would quibble with the suggestion that they may be doing that from a position of strength. \xc2\xa0I think the fact is they are -- that these kinds of decisions are decisions that are being made because their hand is being forced and because they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about ultimately losing a significant bet that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already placed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, on cyber. \xc2\xa0In the conference call earlier this week -- it was a prelude to the Xi visit -- it was suggested -- and maybe I misinterpreted -- that the administration draws a very sharp distinction between espionage in the cyber world and private companies being infiltrated by state or non-state actors. Is that true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0And that\'s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As regards to China.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0And this is a distinction that we\'ve drawn previously. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this distinction before. \xc2\xa0But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So in the context of conversations, there is a sense from the administration that if you\'re conducting espionage it\'s not nearly as bad as if you\'re going after private intellectual property or other cyber-crimes, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think I would characterize one as not bad or worse than the other. \xc2\xa0I think what we would merely --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Your higher priority is the private sector, yes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what we would want the Chinese to do is to acknowledge the difference between the two. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And work out an agreement on the private side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly recognize the difference between the two, and we have raised significant public concerns that have been echoed in private conversations about the continued government-enabled cyber theft that is used for financial gain or at least financial advantage by a bunch of Chinese companies. \xc2\xa0Again, this is a concern that we\'ve raised many times with them. \xc2\xa0It even resulted in some Chinese military officials being indicted by the Justice Department because of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m just trying to get the sense of priorities in these conversations and what you\'re trying to get at in terms of an arms control agreement on cyber. \xc2\xa0Is the priority on the private side and less on the espionage side because you can\'t get agreements on that because that\'s going to be something that states are going to do no matter what? \xc2\xa0And the biggest priority for the President is to try to lock something down on the private side of this equation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what you could -- I would say that we are concerned by all of China\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0So stipulating that -- I wouldn\'t want anybody to misunderstand that -- the concerns that we have raised most loudly are those concerns centered around government-enabled cyber theft for financial gain. \xc2\xa0This is something that China has been engaged in for quite some time, and it has drawn significant rebukes from the administration. \xc2\xa0These are concerns that President Obama has raised directly with his counterpart on previous engagements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, yes, the possibility of using sanctions against any country or any actor that engages in this kind of behavior or benefits from it is a tool that continues to be at the President\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How do you think Pope Francis has changed the debate on immigration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it remains to be seen. \xc2\xa0I think the outlines of the debate are quite clear based on the degree to which we have engaged in this debate over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it is quite clear right now that there is strong bipartisan support across the country for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform because of the kind of economic and fiscal benefits that are associated with it, to say nothing of the moral component of this policy initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why you\'ve seen leaders in the Catholic Church, other religious leaders across the country, business interests, law enforcement leaders all come forward in support of that -- of a comprehensive, common-sense approach to immigration reform. \xc2\xa0That kind of support was effectively mobilized to advance legislation in bipartisan fashion through the United States Senate in 2013. \xc2\xa0And that bipartisan support across the country actually mobilized what we believe would have been a majority of votes in the United States House of Representatives, had that legislation not been blocked by Republicans in the House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve lamented this outcome for quite some time now. \xc2\xa0But the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with just lamenting the outcome; he was determined to act. \xc2\xa0And he set out to initiate a whole series of executive actions to do as much as he possibly could to try to address some of the flaws in our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we have never viewed that as a substitute for legislative action. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President has promised that he would actually repeal all those executive actions if Congress were to take action. \xc2\xa0But I think ultimately --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the Speaker expressed any -- is there a remote possibility that this could resurface before the President\xe2\x80\x99s time is up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to this issue has not waned. \xc2\xa0If anything, his commitment to this issue has only strengthened. \xc2\xa0But ultimately I think the person who needs to answer this question is the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And during the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s speech, he called for the abolition of the death penalty. \xc2\xa0And I know the President has called for a review of executions in the federal prison system in the past. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously called for criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0Would the President like to see the death penalty abolished in this country?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, you\'ve heard the President speak about this a couple of times. \xc2\xa0And in the context of answering this question in the past, the President has noted his concerns with the way that the death penalty has been applied. \xc2\xa0There is all kinds of data to indicate that there may be some racial disparities associated with the death penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a variety of concerns that have been raised by some charitable organizations that have taken up the cause of those who have been on death row who have mobilized enough evidence to actually have those individuals exonerated, and serious questions raised about those who have already been put to death. \xc2\xa0So certainly those kinds of results are troubling.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are influenced by statements that are made by the Pope most recently, but by the Catholic bishops previously. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have a new policy position to announce at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed his position on that at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any policy position to announce.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on China, getting back to China, is the administration aware -- just getting back to the OPM data theft -- of any of that data being improperly used at this point? \xc2\xa0Has that surfaced?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think for that question I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Homeland Security. \xc2\xa0Let me check on that. \xc2\xa0I have not heard that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know we asked that question maybe a few weeks ago, and I don\'t know if we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten an update on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten an update on that, but let me see if I can follow up with you in terms of which government agency may be able to give you a steer on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, the Pope visited Little Sisters yesterday evening. \xc2\xa0Did the White House take that as a message from the Pope about I guess the difference that the Catholic Church has with the administration over this contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0It seemed to be intended as a message. \xc2\xa0Is that how it was received?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to the Vatican for what was intended by the visit. \xc2\xa0As it relates to the specific case that has been brought to the courts by this particular organization, I believe now that seven appellate courts have considered the steps that the administration has taken to both protect access to health care for women while also protecting the religious liberty of the members of this particular organization. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSeven of those appeals courts have found that our efforts to strike that balance between access to health care and religious liberty was effectively reached. \xc2\xa0There was one appellate court that concluded that it had not, and it may mean that there will end up being additional legal action in this area. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think, if anything, this particular case does illustrate the lengths to which this administration has gone to protect religious liberty while at the same time protecting access to health care that millions of women rely upon.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to pinpoint -- when you were talking to Major about the CR, you said the White House is willing to accept a short-term CR, not a long-term CR. \xc2\xa0So is it safe to say this idea of a continuing resolution that would fund the government until the end of the year or until December, the White House would oppose that, right? \xc2\xa0Is that what you mean by long term? \xc2\xa0I mean, that takes us all the way to the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that the -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at this point prejudge what that length would be. \xc2\xa0I mean, I think, as Major pointed out -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got more experience covering these issues than I do -- that sometimes it could take a little while for these differences when it comes to the budget to be resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you might be willing to accept a continuing resolution that would fund the government all the way until December?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what we\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to do is to join Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill in support of a piece of legislation that would prevent a government shutdown while also providing Congress enough time to work in bipartisan fashion to reach the kind of an agreement that ensures adequate funding for both our economic and our national security priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When was the last time the President spoke to Speaker of the House Boehner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, as you know, the President does have on occasion the opportunity to speak with Republican leaders in Congress. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every single conversation that occurs between those two leaders. \xc2\xa0Occasionally, we\xe2\x80\x99ve found that it\xe2\x80\x99s more productive for those conversations to be kept confidential. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut certainly the expectation that we have is that Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell will engage in conversations with Democratic leaders in Congress; that ultimately it is the responsibility of Congress to pass a budget. \xc2\xa0Both Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell have attempted to pass legislation strictly along party lines to fund the government, but those efforts have not yielded legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s arrived on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk. \xc2\xa0And that means that, ultimately, Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner are going to have to confront the differences that they have with Democrats in Congress before any legislation will arrive at the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged them to do that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear our willingness to facilitate those conversations, to contribute to them so that whatever bipartisan agreement is able to be reached would be one that the President is willing to sign. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then quickly on Putin -- you said Putin requested the meeting. \xc2\xa0Did he say why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because obviously a lot of things to talk to Vladimir Putin about. \xc2\xa0Did he say why he wanted to speak with the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Kremlin for their explanation about why President Putin would like to meet with President Obama. \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make clear to you why President Obama believes that a conversation with President Putin could be useful.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, well the Kremlin has been quite forthright in saying that, first of all, that Putin wanted a meeting, being the first to be out there to say the meeting would happen, and then now the only one to tell us exactly when that meeting is supposedly taking place. \xc2\xa0Was the President kind of reluctant to take this meeting? \xc2\xa0It seems like the Kremlin has been certainly more forthcoming in talking about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think some might conclude that that means the Russians are --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0More transparent? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, or --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know, I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. \xc2\xa0Or more desperate, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is he more eager to have this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They certainly -- I think it is fair for you to say that based on the repeated requests we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Russians, that they are quite interested in having a conversation with President Obama. \xc2\xa0And after, I think what I would acknowledge, is some careful consideration on our end, the President did make a decision that it was worth it at this point to engage with President Putin in a face-to-face meeting to see if the interests of the United States could be advanced in the context of those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis has been a hallmark of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to a range of foreign policy issues that, despite our significant disagreements, the President has been willing to engage in conversations with the hope that they may be able to -- that those conversations could advance our interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this case, it appears that President Putin is convinced that his position would be -- would benefit from a conversation with President Obama. \xc2\xa0And if that\'s the case, hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find some common ground and have the kinds of conversations that would result in advancing our mutual interests. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also -- we\'re also quite aware, and I think one of the reasons that an offer like this is something that receives a lot of deliberation is that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the Russians be particularly willing to live up to the commitments they have made in the context of diplomatic talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a number of times that President Putin has sat down with Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande to discuss Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And in the context of those conversations, Russia has made any number of commitments about their ongoing support for combined Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. \xc2\xa0But Russia hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really been willing to follow up -- or follow through on those commitments. \xc2\xa0So I think that would explain why an offer from President Putin to meet face to face with President Obama is one that is carefully considered and deliberated upon before it\xe2\x80\x99s accepted.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to get a little more window into that consideration in what has changed so that you feel like this is a productive time to meet with Putin after more than a year of giving him the diplomatic cold shoulder.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there have been -- we talked before that there have been some engagements between President Obama and President Putin -- a couple on the phone this summer, and a couple in person last fall. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t know if I can point to a specific thing that has changed. \xc2\xa0But I do think that the President and his team have concluded that there is the potential for something constructive to come out of a meeting between the Russian President and President Obama. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn\'t mean that there will be a major announcement out of the meeting. \xc2\xa0In fact, I would be surprised if there is. \xc2\xa0But could it lay the groundwork for some more constructive conversations and more effective cooperation between our two countries? \xc2\xa0That possibility does exist. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, President Putin himself says that he -- or at least he claims to share the goals of our counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0If that\'s true, then it seems like it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard to convince him to contribute to our ongoing effort. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what President Putin is willing to commit to, and if he does make any commitments, if he\xe2\x80\x99s actually willing to follow through on them. \xc2\xa0When it comes to matters like Ukraine, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been willing to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So while Ukraine is at the top of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, how much was Syria a factor into deciding to take this meeting now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'re certainly aware -- and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed here -- of the concerns with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And the President has spoken publicly about how Russia doubling down on their support for Assad would be a losing bet, so we\'re certainly mindful that that\'s on the agenda, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not what the President believes is the most pressing issue between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To follow up on Scott, you just mentioned two individuals vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the Ukraine issue, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande. \xc2\xa0Is David Cameron in the mix? \xc2\xa0And might the President have a conversation -- does he look forward to a conversation with the leaders who are involved in the sanctions for Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Ukraine before he meets with Mr. Putin kind of as a rallying call or conversation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out any consultations with Prime Minister Cameron. \xc2\xa0In fact, if you stick around today, we may have a little news in that regard. \xc2\xa0And I think this sort of reflects the kind of international consensus there is about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing behavior inside of Ukraine and concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s intent when it comes to the use of their military inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, Russia is operating from a position of weakness in confronting challenges in both those countries. \xc2\xa0But they have taken steps that we believe in both situations are counterproductive when it comes to both their own interests but also the broader international community\xe2\x80\x99s interests. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a collective interest in respecting the basic territorial integrity of sovereign nations. \xc2\xa0We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest to observe those international norms. \xc2\xa0Instead, they\xe2\x80\x99ve flouted them for more than a year now. \xc2\xa0And that has been a source of some concern not just on the part of the United States, but on the part of the United States and our European allies. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the kinds of steps that have isolated Russia and taken a toll on the economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned earlier, if I may, that Mr. Putin has a reason for staying in involved with Syria. \xc2\xa0It seems to be his -- I don\'t know -- I don\'t want to put words in your mouth -- is it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a surrogate nation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve described them as a client state. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s been that way for some time now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the former Soviet Union, under Mr. Khrushchev, also had influence and a desire to find a client state with Mr. Nasser during that era in Egypt. \xc2\xa0Do you think that Mr. Putin may have his eyes on some other countries, as well, in the Middle East to get that stronghold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that -- well, let me confront this in a couple of ways. \xc2\xa0The first is, when you\'re the -- when you\'ve been reduced to the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, it means that you\'re going to have to be very judicious about how you choose to invest your resources. \xc2\xa0And it means that President Putin will have to choose wisely as he considers how to account for some of the weakness in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest in some of these other locations. \xc2\xa0So I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that he may choose other venues to try to exercise some influence. \xc2\xa0But his ability to do that is going to be constrained by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s international isolation and their declining economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When the President spoke to the Business Roundtable recently, and he talked about China and how the administration was preparing steps or initiatives to show China that they were more than mildly upset, was he referring to the economic sanctions? \xc2\xa0And was he also referring to just sort of the business -- U.S. business intrusions, or also U.S. government intrusions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\'re talking about on China here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What the President talked about in the context of the Business Roundtable is raising the kinds of concerns that we have in the past about government-enabled cyber theft that we have suggested that China has previously been involved with for the financial gain of corporations inside of China. \xc2\xa0There are other instances where it certainly has given them a competitive advantage over U.S. businesses. \xc2\xa0That\'s been the source of significant concern. \xc2\xa0This is something that President Obama has raised with President Xi in previous meetings between the two leaders. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s also -- these are also concerns that President Obama raised with President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in meetings that he had with President Hu. \xc2\xa0So these are long-running concerns, and these are concerns that have long been priorities of the business community. \xc2\xa0They recognize that some of this behavior has had an impact on their ability to do business around the world and do business inside of China.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President made the observation that many times he would attend either a meeting like the Business Roundtable, or a private meeting with business leaders here at the White House -- which the President does occasionally -- where business officials would get exercised about the conditions inside of China and the impact that it\xe2\x80\x99s having on their company.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut yet they\xe2\x80\x99ve also been reluctant to have the United States aggressively press their case on their behalf because they\xe2\x80\x99re worried about either some sort of retribution or retaliation on the part of the Chinese. \xc2\xa0So the President made clear that that had previously hamstrung efforts that were undertaken by the U.S. government to try to protect those business interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo overall, though, this is an issue that will be -- will rate highly on the agenda when President Xi is here to meet with President Obama. \xc2\xa0And what is clear -- I guess the one piece of good news that is here is that what is clear is that it is clear that China now understands just how seriously we take this issue, and how serious we are about getting them to try to address it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t blamed China for the OPM hack, but is that specifically -- will the President raise that specifically with President Xi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge any of their conversations. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99re right that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t publicly made any pronouncements about --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you privately?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- who may have been responsible for that particular incident. \xc2\xa0The work of our investigators continues, and there are some conclusions that they have drawn that have been aired publicly, but nothing that we have made a pronouncement about at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge whether or not an incident like that would come up in the context of the private conversation between the two Presidents, but certainly the broader issue will.</p>\n<p>\n\tColleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0There are reports today that the U.S. and Russia have reached some sort of agreement on how to end the crisis in Syria. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s an Assad advisor saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- this person calls it \xe2\x80\x9ctacit agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d and that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some change in the West\xe2\x80\x99s position. \xc2\xa0Any truth to that? \xc2\xa0Is there any sort of agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report, but based on the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described it I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put a lot of stock in it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any change in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Angela, you had your hand up earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Following up on Pam\xe2\x80\x99s question and your emphasis on the word \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of assigning blame for the OPM hack, is publicly naming China as the perpetrator of that a potential bargaining chip when the President meets with his counterpart today and tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- at this point I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on what the eventual conclusion of our investigators who are continuing to look at this matter will be. \xc2\xa0So at this point, it would be too early to speculate on whether or not we would make -- we would publicly implicate China in that particular matter. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will just say that we have made clear our concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activity -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, China\xe2\x80\x99s activity in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re jumping back and forth here so I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to keep up -- and there are a range of tools that are at the President\xe2\x80\x99s disposal for responding to those concerns. \xc2\xa0And we do continue to believe that just having some of those tools on the table, including possible financial sanctions, have been effective in serving as a deterrent, and in advancing our interests in this regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as for anything that could come up in the context of their meetings, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to preview beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then to go back to Russia -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s top agenda item is Ukraine for that meeting, but your counterpart at the Kremlin spoke to reporters a couple hours ago and said that they plan to talk about Syria, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s time they\xe2\x80\x99ll also get to Ukraine. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There will be time. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0There will be time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does that portend a tense meeting, given these very different agendas?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It might. \xc2\xa0Look, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President has described his previous discussions with President Putin as \xe2\x80\x9cblunt\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbusinesslike.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate significant, overt hostility, but I do think that there are some serious issues that the United States and Russia have to discuss. \xc2\xa0And the President is not going to shy away from raising our significant concerns with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in Ukraine and other places around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Over the course of the past few months, even today, U.S.-Russian relations have been described as \xe2\x80\x9ctense,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cstrained,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cchilly,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ccool.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does President Putin bear sole responsibility for where U.S.-Russian relations are right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I would say it this way. \xc2\xa0My guess is that President Putin is not particularly concerned about the use of those adjectives to describe the relationships between our two countries. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think that he may feel that that may enhance his status one way or another. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is, because of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in Ukraine and their ongoing support for the combined Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, the United States has engaged in a policy of working with our allies in Europe to isolate Russia. \xc2\xa0And that could result in a relationship -- or it could result in at least some of those words being an apt description of the relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to waive those sanctions as soon as Russia is prepared to demonstrate a commitment to complying with the agreements that were reached in Minsk. \xc2\xa0Thus far, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been either unwilling or unable to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said in answer to my question that it may actually \xe2\x80\x9cenhance\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s status. \xc2\xa0I would imagine when you say that back home, perhaps --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I was alluding to is I think he thinks it may enhance his status. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Russia, certainly over the last year, and President Putin directly over the last year, seek to position Russia sort of as the chief competitor to the United States around the world. \xc2\xa0And the President has previously described Russia as a regional power to illustrate that they do have influence in the region and are seeking to hold on to the influence that they may be losing in places like the Middle East. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is different than the kind of influence that the United States wields all around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You have sometimes personalized things as it relates to President Putin, and so has the President. \xc2\xa0The President once said that \xe2\x80\x9cPutin\xe2\x80\x99s schtick is to look like the tough guy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He once also said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe does have a public style where he likes to sit back and look a little bored during the course of joint interviews.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does that help matters in terms of that U.S.-Russian relationship when you and the President himself personalizes things in that matter about President Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I suspect that that was a question that was in response to a question the President was asked about his personal relationship with President Putin. \xc2\xa0I think the irony of your question is -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean this as a criticism but I think it is a fact -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency on the part of all of you as you observe these interactions to personalize them. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has tried to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President could answer -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to answer in that matter, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s asked a question, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to answer it that way, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s true. \xc2\xa0But he goes to great lengths to try to answer your questions, and so that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think he was trying to do there.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me make one other observation about this, which is that anybody who subscribes to the Wall Street Journal may have seen a picture of President Putin -- just a little plug there, Colleen --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks for that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome -- may have seen the picture of the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Putin, where the two leaders were sitting side by side \xc2\xa0in their chairs, and President Putin was striking a now familiar pose of less-than-perfect posture and unbuttoned jacket, and knees spread far apart, to convey a particular image. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I guess the point is, President Putin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to project this image only when President Obama is around. \xc2\xa0I think this is an image that he seeks to project in a variety of international settings, and he did it as recently as his meeting earlier this week with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I would like to ask a question of Volkswagen, if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible. \xc2\xa0Considering the magnitude of its scandal and shaking up the very bedrock of German manufacturing and actually German economy, and giving this proud slogan, \xe2\x80\x9cMade in Germany\xe2\x80\x9d a completely new and surprising spin, has there been any communications between the Chancellor and the White House, or other parts of the two administrations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any conversations between President Obama and Chancellor Merkel on this particular issue in the last week or so. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency takes quite seriously the responsibility that they have to enforce the standards under the Clean Air Act. \xc2\xa0And the expectation is that, at least in the auto industry, that all companies that are seeking to sell automobiles in the United States will comply accordingly. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd based on the admission from Volkswagen executives, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t just fail to comply, they actually sought to actively circumvent those rules. \xc2\xa0And there will be -- we\'ve already seen some executive-level changes in the company, and we\'ll see what additional steps that company decides they need to take to repair what I think could be accurately described as evident damage to that company\xe2\x80\x99s credibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question about Syria. \xc2\xa0Chancellor Merkel said just recently basically there will be no solution without Assad. She said in solving the Syria crisis one has to talk to a couple of leaders, including Assad. \xc2\xa0Is that kind of an about-face to the West and the U.S. who so far basically said there cannot be a solution with Assad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I did not see the entirety of her remarks, but the position of the United States is quite clear. \xc2\xa0And I think that Chancellor Merkel is largely on the same page. \xc2\xa0She understands that so much of the chaos that we have seen in Syria is a direct result of the failed leadership of the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And in order to address that problem, and in order to eventually deal with the chaos that ISIL, for example, has capitalized on, to deal with the significant humanitarian crisis in the form of Syrian refugees, that we need to address the root cause of this problem. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why the United States has insisted that a political transition inside of Syria needs to take place that results in Bashar al-Assad leaving power. \xc2\xa0That ultimately will be the way to solve these problems. \xc2\xa0And there will be challenges that remain as long as he does.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would he have to leave before the transition or at the end of the transition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\'t get into sort of how we see these talks progressing, and unfortunately we haven\'t seen the talks progress very much of late. \xc2\xa0And that\'s been the source of some disappointment here. \xc2\xa0But we are going to continue -- the United States will continue to play a role in trying to facilitate those United Nations-led talks to effect that political transition that we believe is long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know the agenda between the President and President Xi is long, but does the President have any intention of bringing up Russia and the U.S. and global, international concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s disposition in Ukraine or Syria with the Chinese President while he\xe2\x80\x99s here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t rule out that that may come up. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think those issues feature most prominently on the agenda. I think the things that are most likely to be discussed are things certainly related to cybersecurity, which we\'ve discussed at length in here. \xc2\xa0I would expect that there will be continued efforts to cooperate on the issue of climate change, and there may be an opportunity for greater cooperation between our two countries. \xc2\xa0We\'ve certainly been pleased with the commitment that President Xi and the Chinese people have shown to this issue. \xc2\xa0And if there is more progress that we can make, we certainly would welcome the opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have obviously been some greater economic challenges inside of China, some volatility in their financial markets, and the United States obviously has some long-running concerns about China\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to more effectively tie their currency to market rates. \xc2\xa0This is something that Secretary Lew has talked about quite a bit. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are also some broader strategic issues that I would expect that would come up -- the South China Sea is probably the most prominent among them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as we always say, President Obama raises concerns about the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s respect for basic human rights. \xc2\xa0That is a central value of this country, and therefore, a national security priority of the United States and of this President. \xc2\xa0And I think that he would use the occasion of this series of meetings to underscore once again what a priority that is for the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0So we\'ll have a news conference tomorrow between President Obama and President Xi. \xc2\xa0It\'s early afternoon -- it\'s around noon. \xc2\xa0It will be a two-and-two. \xc2\xa0The plan right now is to do it in the Rose Garden, weather permitting. \xc2\xa0The East Room will be set up for the state dinner. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ll do that. \xc2\xa0And then we\'ll get a week-ahead out on paper tomorrow afternoon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa021-gun?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa021-gun salute. \xc2\xa0So there you go. \xc2\xa0Pop your popcorn. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:29 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
