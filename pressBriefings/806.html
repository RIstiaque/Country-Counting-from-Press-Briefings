EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being with us as we return to Washington earlier than expected.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of statements I want to give to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First -- and this just went out from me -- the President will no longer travel to Green Bay, Wisconsin tomorrow for a campaign event so that he can stay in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday and closely monitor the impact of and response to Hurricane Sandy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As he said at FEMA Headquarters yesterday, the President has instructed his team to make sure that needed federal resources are in place to support state and local recovery efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Additional details about the President\'s schedule will be announced as soon as they are available.</p>\n<p>Separately, when the President gets back to Washington he will lead a meeting in the White House Situation Room, where he will be updated on the latest forecast for Hurricane Sandy and the extensive federal efforts underway to support the state and local response of this historic storm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will convene the meeting via video teleconference with Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano, FEMA Administrator Fugate, Transportation Secretary LaHood, Energy Secretary Chu, and National Hurricane Center Director Richard Knabb.\xc2\xa0 Also participating at the White House will be Chief of Staff Jack Lew, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security John Brennan, Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromonaco, Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Richard Reed, and other senior members of the President\'s team.</p>\n<p>That\'s all I have at the top.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear from the President today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no scheduling announcements for you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you tell us how the decision unfolded for him to return to Washington without the political event today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we had already made adjustments to our schedule because of Hurricane Sandy.\xc2\xa0 The storm overnight picked up speed and intensity, and a decision was made that in order to return to Washington to monitor and oversee the efforts to prepare for the storm and respond to it, that we needed to leave earlier than planned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys tell us often that the President can do his job as President on the road, while he\'s campaigning.\xc2\xa0 Why decide to actually go back to Washington and be at the White House for this event when he\'s stayed out on the road for campaign events in previous incidents this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s priority right now is the safety and security of Americans who are in the path of the storm and who will be affected by it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s essential, in his view, that he be in Washington, one of the areas that will be affected and where his team is, to oversee that effort and to be updated on it.</p>\n<p>It is true that the President is President 24 hours a day.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the circumstances where, in his view, it makes the most sense for him to be in place in the White House fulfilling those responsibilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, the early departure today back to D.C., was that primarily for safety reasons -- would it have been unsafe to have flown in at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not an aviation expert, but it is the case that we had originally hoped to do the event this morning and then fly back, but because the storm was moving more quickly than was the case, as I understand it, yesterday evening, that it made it essential for us to leave earlier in the morning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is losing two days of campaigning then?\xc2\xa0 It won\'t be either today or tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no calls on Wednesday yet, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We have not made a call.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously closely monitoring the storm, relying on local and state authorities for their guidance, and will make adjustments to the schedule accordingly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, some of the utilities are saying that the power is going to be out in some areas for up to 10 days, which would obviously include Election Day.\xc2\xa0 Is there any contingency planning to alter the Election Day schedule because of this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that is not something I\'m able to address.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the storm is just taking effect now and having an impact now and making landfall I believe tonight.\xc2\xa0 We have to focus on not the campaign and not the election, but on making sure that all federal resources are both prepositioned and in place to help states and localities respond to the storm, to help Americans who are affected by the storm.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our focus right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President have the power to adjust Election Day?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re getting way ahead of yourself here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the utilities are saying 10 days of power outage, like Virginia, for instance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t -- I think we\'ll have to take that question.</p>\n<p>]\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have more confidence in Pepco, or Old Dominion Power?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is working with his team; FEMA is working with state and local governments who obviously liasse directly with utility companies to handle this kind of an event.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that means Pepco?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe how the schedule changes are going to affect the get out the vote operation in Florida and elsewhere?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.\xc2\xa0 As Jay has mentioned, our focus, the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus, the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s focus is ensuring the safety of the American people, of our volunteers, of our supporters.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on every single day.\xc2\xa0 There are places where -- in Virginia, for example, the State Board of Elections is now allowing voters who may be affected by the storm to vote absentee in person.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a step they took in response to this.\xc2\xa0 There are steps like that that obviously are encouraging.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we are -- where it is safe, our campaign is up and running in the places where our volunteers and our staff are safe.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s many parts of the country.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intercede with the fact that the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus over the next 48 hours, or however long it takes, will be on the storm and making sure people are safe across the country.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Also, before -- I meant to mention this at the top.\xc2\xa0 The President -- overnight, we announced several more emergency declarations, and that brings to eight the total of emergency declarations.\xc2\xa0 That includes Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New York, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland.\xc2\xa0 These declarations make federal aid available to make sure state and local responders have support they need as they work to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, as preparations and initial response efforts take place.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, emergence declarations are made in response to requests from states and also the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll just add, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking it, and our team is taking it, day by day, because no one can predict exactly where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in 24 hours or 48 hours.\xc2\xa0 So decisions are made on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 And that applies to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule but it also applies to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground where appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President to campaign with Bill Clinton later?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you going to try to reschedule that?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that.\xc2\xa0 As you know, or just to confirm for you, President Clinton is doing the event this morning in Florida.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be going on to Youngstown to do the event in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are big fans of having him out there advocating for the President.\xc2\xa0 So where possible over the next eight days we would love that but don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on them campaigning together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talk to us about the balancing act that the President obviously has to do right now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seven days out, eight days out -- what\xe2\x80\x99s he weighing, how is he doing it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that the balance tilts heavily towards, in a situation like this, his responsibilities as President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve made the changes to the schedule that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re headed back to Washington now. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President will be in Washington through today and tomorrow, and we will make changes to the schedule as necessary\xc2\xa0 -- if necessary, going forward.</p>\n<p>This is a time not for politics, but at a moment like this, with a storm as severe as this, with likely impacts as consequential as we will see, the President is very focused on making sure that the federal response effort is comprehensive, that every state and locality has what it needs.\xc2\xa0 And that includes all the prepositioning of resources that FEMA has done in key locations prior to landfall.\xc2\xa0 It includes embedding FEMA officials in state emergency centers so that that communication is immediate.\xc2\xa0 And it includes at the presidential level, directing all responsible parties in the federal government to be taking the necessary steps to ensure that everything possible is done to protect the American people in a storm like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, you guys have lost two campaign days now.\xc2\xa0 How does the President make up for that lost time?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think this is a case where politics takes a backseat.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s role is governing the country and doing what he was elected to do four years ago, which is to make sure people have the resources and the information they need.\xc2\xa0 That will be his focus as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s needed.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not worried about the other piece of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point did you make the call not to attend the event this morning?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that could have been made last night?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we were all looking at forecasts last night that made it seem like the storm was going to be in D.C. pretty early.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve based on our decisions on the information that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting about the storm and the recommendations of the various agencies that assess storms like these and also have responsibility for transportation and security for the President.</p>\n<p>As of yesterday evening, the intention was -- based on what we knew about the storm\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory and speed -- that we could have the event in Florida this morning and leave in time to get back to Washington.\xc2\xa0 The decision was made early this morning that we needed to leave earlier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the Vice President stay on the trail throughout the week during this storm?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will be in Ohio today with President Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know beyond today what his schedule is, but we can get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what kind of role do you think Governor Romney should be playing during the storm?\xc2\xa0 Is it appropriate for him to stay on the trail with a full slate of events, or scale back as well?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let the American people be the judge of that.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s role as Commander-in-Chief is to be focused on making sure the American people are safe and have the information they need.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what his focus is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been encouraging our supporters to donate online to the American Red Cross through BarackObama.com and through our Facebook site. Traditionally with emergency situations like Hurricane Sandy, the Red Cross asks for financial donations so that they can manage the distribution, and so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging people to do as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of pizzas did the President deliver last night?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question and get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President upset that he went all this way just to deliver six boxes of pizza?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 He was happy he was able to make some calls to some super volunteers.\xc2\xa0 If the President -- if the storm had allowed us to go to the event even early this morning, we would have done that.\xc2\xa0 And it just -- the circumstances just didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow that to happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:07 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
