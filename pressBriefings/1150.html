EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.\xc2\xa0 I have a quick announcement.\xc2\xa0 Later this week, the President will meet at the White House with the Senate Democratic caucus on Wednesday, and the Senate Republican caucus on Thursday, to talk about the range of important issues on the legislative agenda, including the need to adopt a balanced approach in confronting the nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-term deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 The President plans to meet with the House Democratic and Republican caucuses at the White House for similar discussions in the next few weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\'ll go to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that for you right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple topics, please.\xc2\xa0 We keep hearing about this good, cooperative relationship with Pakistan in the fallout of the bin Laden raid.\xc2\xa0 But to my knowledge they\xe2\x80\x99re still not making available the three wives that were taken into custody after the raid.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if they plan to do that, and if not, is that something that the White House is simply willing to accept?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, the United States and Pakistan have an important, complicated relationship, as we\'ve said.\xc2\xa0 The cooperation that we\'ve had with Pakistan has been important for years now in our fight against terrorism and terrorists, and more terrorists have been killed on Pakistani soil because of that cooperation than anywhere else in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s important to note -- which is not to say we don\'t have our differences, because we do.\xc2\xa0 We obviously do.\xc2\xa0 And those differences are frequently aired.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is that relationship is important.\xc2\xa0 The cooperation continues to be important for the United States in order to pursue al Qaeda and other terrorists as the war continues after the death of Osama bin Laden.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are in consultations with the Pakistani government at many levels about the matter you raised, Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wives, and some of the other materials that may have been collected by the Pakistanis after the commando team left.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue those conversations.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it is very important to maintain the cooperative relationship with Pakistan precisely because it\xe2\x80\x99s in our national security interest to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where do you think those conversations will lead, specifically on access to intelligence?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the essence of cooperation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we remain confident that we will continue to be able to cooperate with the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific announcement about what that cooperation will produce, but we do believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important and we do believe that it will continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President trust the Pakistani leaders when they say, in essence, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do a full investigation about whether anybody was complicit in harboring bin Laden?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said is that we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the Pakistanis do a full investigation.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously doing a full investigation and examining some of the substantial material that our operators collected in bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound for evidence of the support network that must have existed to allow Osama bin Laden to continue to live in Abbottabad from so long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will cite Tom Donilon from his interviews yesterday, where he said he was not aware of any indication at this point that anyone in the leadership in the Pakistani government was aware, had foreknowledge of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s presence there in Abbottabad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But obviously this is an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 And again, it is important to remember, as complex as this relationship is, despite the differences that we have, that it remains a very important and vital relationship for the United States because of our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we continue to make the effort to cooperate with Pakistan, because it\xe2\x80\x99s in our interest to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when they offer those assurances that there will be a full investigation, is that something that the administration believes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that they will investigate it, and we hope it will be a full and complete investigation, but we are also obviously investigating, ourselves.\xc2\xa0 And this is all part of a cooperative relationship that we need to have, and we have had, despite our differences in the past, and we think we will continue to have going into the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on one other topic.\xc2\xa0 The immigration speech tomorrow the President plans to give -- can you give us a sense of whether he will be making any points that are new?\xc2\xa0 Obviously he gave the big policy speech at American University.\xc2\xa0 Is this a new speech or a reiteration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there will be new elements to it and I encourage you to listen and watch, as I do Americans everywhere, because it will reflect his continued commitment to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to achieve it in the first part of this term, the President\xe2\x80\x99s term, but it remains a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- even though it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. He takes on hard things because he believes they\xe2\x80\x99re important to get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd hard things often mean bipartisan things.\xc2\xa0 And one thing I would note is that there was substantial bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform in the past, at the highest levels of the Republican Party, including the President, George W. Bush, including Senator John McCain, the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee in 2008.\xc2\xa0 So the capacity for bipartisan support for this kind of immigration reform, comprehensive reform,exists.\xc2\xa0 It was -- it existed in the past; we think we can build support for it again in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech tomorrow will be about trying to continue to build public support.\xc2\xa0 And I think he will make points about the steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken on border security, the fact that the number of border agents today is double what it was in 2004.\xc2\xa0 We have tripled the number of intelligence analysts working the border.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed unmanned aerial vehicles that now patrol the border from Texas to California.\xc2\xa0 We are screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south, even as we go after drugs coming north.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing results.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he will also talk about -- if I may -- the economic impact, the economic imperative of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It is simply foolish as a matter of policy, when we think about global competition -- economic competition that we face in the 21st century, to educate some of the smartest, most creative entrepreneurial young people from around the world in our universities -- the finest in the world -- and then not let them stay to start businesses, to launch startups to create jobs here in America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Mayor Bloomberg recently noted this fact, that in recent years a full 25 percent of high-tech startups in the United States were founded by immigrants, leading to 450,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 We need those jobs.\xc2\xa0 We need those good, high-paying, high-tech 21st century jobs.\xc2\xa0 So this is another point he\xe2\x80\x99ll be making.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Gilani of Pakistan, in his address to Parliament today, seemed more focused on what his government sees as a violation of sovereignty in the Osama bin Laden raid and not as much on the issue of getting to the bottom of whether anyone in his government was complicit in sheltering bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the administration that these kind of recriminations may severely damage relations that are already strained?\xc2\xa0 And he also warned of serious consequence if any further mission of this sort is undertaken.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. taking that seriously and going --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously take the statements and concerns of the Pakistani government seriously, but we also do not apologize for the action that we took, that this President took.\xc2\xa0 He said dating back to the campaign, if there is an opportunity to bring Osama bin Laden to justice and he is on Pakistani soil and this is the only way we can do it, do it unilaterally, he will take that chance and do it -- and he did.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply beyond a doubt in his mind that he had the right and the imperative to do this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So having said that, he -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to what I said to Ben\xc2\xa0 -- our relationship with Pakistan remains very important to us.\xc2\xa0 Our need for cooperation remains very important.\xc2\xa0 We will work with the Prime Minister and the President and other government leaders in Pakistan to work through our differences and continue the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past that has led to so many successes in the fight against terrorism and terrorists.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question on China.\xc2\xa0 The President will be meeting this evening with the Chinese delegation in the U.S.-China dialogue.\xc2\xa0 Will he be bringing up U.S. concerns about human rights?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I saw that the Vice President and the Secretary of State brought up our concern about human rights.\xc2\xa0 We have always done that within the context of our very important and broad relationship with China.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t see into the future in terms of what the President will say, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible, even likely, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring that up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut he\xe2\x80\x99ll also talk about the need we have for our overall strategic and economic dialogue.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why this group was formed was to maintain these high-level contacts in a regular -- on a regular basis, to look at all the issues that -- the bilateral issues we have between us, and to make progress on them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that speaks to the rebalancing in our foreign policy that President Obama sought when he came into office, that Tom Donilon has overseen -- both as Deputy National Security Advisor and now as National Security Advisor -- and that our whole national security team has been focused on.\xc2\xa0 And the Chinese-U.S. relationship is very important and that\xe2\x80\x99s what this dialogue is about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the Pakistani government does not allow the U.S. to have access to bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wives for questioning, or to the other materials seized in the raid, will there be consequences?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to anticipate something that we hope -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate happening.\xc2\xa0 We will work cooperatively with the Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are very interested in getting access to the three wives that you mentioned, as well as the information or material that the Pakistanis collected after U.S. forces left.\xc2\xa0 But we are -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have those conversations, and we hope and expect to make progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t want to anticipate something and speak to a hypothetical right now, because we think the relationship is important, the cooperation is important.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences in the past, and overcome them, and we think we can overcome them now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, they have yet to agree to allow the U.S. access to the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As far as I know.\xc2\xa0 But the point is, is that there are constant and regular communications between high-level officials in both governments, the appropriate counterparts, about our need for cooperation, about the concerns from each side, and that\'s the kind of interchange that you would want.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to work through differences.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to further cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And since we\xe2\x80\x99re having that kind of dialogue regularly -- and this week included -- that we anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue the cooperation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of immigration reform, I know the President has had a number of closed-door meetings with a number of stakeholders, I suppose you call them, ranging from Governor Schwarzenegger to Eva Longoria.\xc2\xa0 And given the vote-counting challenge that you have in terms of getting something through the Senate and the House, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t there any individuals at these meetings with whom the President disagrees?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but the important part -- and he has been meeting with stakeholders who view comprehensive immigration reform as a necessity -- maybe not in agreement on every detail of what you put into that package and how you get there --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- supporters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They are, but they also represent a cross-section, a broad cross-section, of America -- Republicans, Democrats, businessmen and women, NGOs, across the board.\xc2\xa0 And what I think that says in building\xc2\xa0 -- what a President needs to do in many cases is build public support.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things he does through this public campaign -- meeting with stakeholders, giving speeches -- is try to raise the profile of an issue, communicate to the American people and members of Congress why it\xe2\x80\x99s an imperative and what the positives are -- especially in this case, as I mentioned, the economic imperative, as well as the border security imperative -- to try to build the case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s -- the President, using his unique abilities because of the nature of his office to communicate, can build the support you\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And so meeting with stakeholders is a way of rallying supporters for comprehensive reform, asking them to go out and speak on behalf of that goal, and to try to generate some support and generate some pressure on Congress to take action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is wouldn\'t it be better -- if you\'re going to take that approach and you\'re not going to go directly to the Jon Kyls and John McCains of the world, but you\'re going to try to go to people who will influence them, why not try to win over the Governor Brewers and the Governor Martinezes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you do -- this is a process where you have meetings with stakeholders and maybe you have meetings with legislators who might be crafting legislation, if we get to that point, which we hope we will, or other elected leaders around the country further down the road.\xc2\xa0 One does not preclude the other.\xc2\xa0 This is an important part of the campaign to build public awareness and public support for comprehensive immigration reform -- which we have to do to make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s got the kind of momentum behind it that gets Congress\xe2\x80\x99s attention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We in Washington, you -- the government, the Congress, the White House -- are dealing with a lot of big issues and there\xe2\x80\x99s a competition for attention.\xc2\xa0 And to give immigration the attention it deserves, the need for immigration reform, the President gets out there and gives a speech like he gives tomorrow, and meets with stakeholders, and he\'ll take other steps as this process moves forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to any Syrian Americans who are looking at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in their home country and the lack of urgency that many perceive this administration to have when it comes to this issue -- can you explain what we\'ve done as a country or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that has had any impact whatsoever on the behavior of the government there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s the point I\'ll make, that you can take actions that have impact on behavior and the behavior may not change instantly.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that as we all witness the historic transformation and upheaval in the region as these unpredicted events have taken place, that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a desire for what\xe2\x80\x99s the endpoint, what\xe2\x80\x99s the closure, what -- why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we doing something to make this turn out well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the fact is, is that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a lot of things in the case of Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve strongly condemned the abhorrent violence that the Syrian government has used against peaceful protesters. We have, as you know, in addition to the existing sanctions against the Syrian government, instituted targeted sanctions against government officials to put pressure on them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with our allies to put united pressure on the Syrian government to cease and desist.\xc2\xa0 And we continue that call today.\xc2\xa0 And the isolation that Syria feels will, we hope, affect its behavior.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made it abundantly clear that the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s security crackdown will not restore stability and will not stop the demands for change.\xc2\xa0 In other words, the action they\xe2\x80\x99re taking is actually entirely counterproductive to the goals they seek.\xc2\xa0 If they seek stability, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually producing instability.\xc2\xa0 The protesters are there because they want -- as they have been in many other countries, they\xe2\x80\x99re demanding to be heard.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re demanding their rights.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re demanding a government that listens to their grievances and respects their aspirations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And stability comes when governments do that, when they engage in a dialogue with the opposition, when they produce the kinds of political reforms that, in this case, the Syrian leadership has promised but has not delivered.\xc2\xa0 We believe -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve called for this to happen.\xc2\xa0 We believe the Syrian government needs to act on its words, act on its promises, and that stability will come from that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move through the row.\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Can the U.S. maintain any kind of real relationship with Pakistan if it turns out, based on all this -- computers and other equipment and information seized from the compound, if it turns out that there\xe2\x80\x99s clear evidence that the government intelligence in Pakistan was helping Osama bin Laden?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a hypothetical, Dan, because we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously reviewing this intelligence, and we we\xe2\x80\x99re investigating the support network that presumably existed to allow Osama bin Laden to live in Abbottabad in that compound for as long as he did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say to you is that this relationship is too important to walk away from.\xc2\xa0 Our cooperation has been highly productive in the past, even when it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the result of agreement on every issue.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Americans to know -- and, understandably, Americans are asking some of these questions about bin Laden being found where he was found and the duration that he was there -- these are completely legitimate questions to ask, and we\xe2\x80\x99re asking them as well.\xc2\xa0 But they should also understand that this relationship, as complicated as it is, has produced results that have benefited American security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, in fact, I think the President said and others have said that while we did not inform Pakistan and Pakistan was not aware of the operation against Osama bin Laden, the overall assistance that they have provided over the last number of years helped in that mission.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s important to recognize, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a relationship that the U.S. will never walk away from?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s too important to walk away without careful consideration.\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\'s probably loose language that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use.\xc2\xa0 The point is that the relationship is complicated, but it is important.\xc2\xa0 It has been cooperative in the past in ways that have been very beneficial for the United States and for American security, and we look forward to continuing the relationship precisely because it\xe2\x80\x99s in our national security interests to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, you said shortly after Osama bin Laden was killed that nothing had changed in terms of the timeline of the withdrawal of troops.\xc2\xa0 With a few more days between --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I said then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Has anything changed at all?\xc2\xa0 Is the administration reviewing its strategies, its policy in Afghanistan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, not in the sense -- the administration -- let me back up.\xc2\xa0 The administration is, of course, in the process of reviewing the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made since the surge reached its full complement.\xc2\xa0 And the President will look at the recommendations from his military commanders for the beginning of that transition in July and the pace of the drawdown.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has not changed at all is the fact that there will be the beginning of that transition.\xc2\xa0 There will be the beginning of a drawdown of those troops.\xc2\xa0 And what also hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed is -- in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reinforced by the advance of eight days ago -- is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to refocus the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the AfPak region, on the fight against al Qaeda, has produced tremendous results for national security, for American security, obviously culminating most recently in the elimination of Osama bin Laden, a mass murderer and the most wanted man in the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But prior to that, we have, through that refocus, been able to put greater pressure on al Qaeda than ever before, reducing the ranks of its leadership and forcing -- putting the squeeze on al Qaeda in a way that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been done in a long, long time, and making them weaker -- which is good, again, for the primary goal. And remember what the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the first line in terms of what the goals of his strategy were, his AfPak strategy, his Afghanistan-Pakistani strategy, announced in December of \xe2\x80\x9909, was disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And remember, we had an interlude for a long time between the invasion of Afghanistan and the arrival of this President in office where the focus -- the principal focus in the national security sense of the administration was on Iraq, and not on Afghanistan and not on al Qaeda central.\xc2\xa0 And the shift was important in producing not just the elimination of Osama bin Laden but a lot of other clear victories in that fight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify, the beginning of the drawdown, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t attach a date to that.\xc2\xa0 It still remains the same --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 July 2011 -- unchanged, correct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President, in his interview, said that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether there might have been some people inside government who knew about -- the Pakistani government -- and then Donilon made very clear there was no indication that any one in the leadership knew.\xc2\xa0 Was he in any way --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what the President said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 Let me just make clear what Mr. Donilon said, was that at this point he was not aware of any indication we\xe2\x80\x99ve had that leaders in Pakistan had any foreknowledge of Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s presence in Abbottabad in that compound.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing obviously with this treasure trove of information is exploiting it for a lot of purposes.\xc2\xa0 One, obviously, looking at it in terms of potential threats, but also in terms of the support network for bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on what either the President or the National Security Advisor said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on the questions about the Prime Minister of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s speech today, his specific words were, \xe2\x80\x9cPakistan reserves the right to retaliate with full force\xe2\x80\x9d if the United States were to engage in another unilateral action.\xc2\xa0 Number one, does the administration object to that kind of threatening language?\xc2\xa0 And number two, do you think -- does that apply to drone strikes in addition to this kind of unilateral action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, all I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do is return to what I was saying which is that the relationship is important.\xc2\xa0 We are in communication at a variety of levels with the Pakistan government about both the operation that took place and the cooperation that we hope to get together with the Pakistanis going forward in our fight against al Qaeda and terrorism in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously the victims of the terrorism that is the focus of this fight are not just Americans alone; they are Pakistanis. Many Pakistanis have suffered the loss of life because of the terrorists in their midst.\xc2\xa0 So this is a fight that\'s in the interest of both countries.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to cooperation in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that sounds like a threat, \xe2\x80\x9cretaliate with full force.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Was it -- do you deem it a threat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, Pakistan has -- is a sovereign nation, and we understand their concerns.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that given the threat that Osama bin Laden represents -- represented rather -- to the United States, given that he was the most wanted man in the world -- a mass murderer, a terrorist who continued to plot against the United States and our allies -- that the President would use whatever means necessary to ensure that we could eliminate him.\xc2\xa0 And he did that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he did it -- look, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, too, the mission he undertook, the risky decision he made to deploy the commando raid option also ensured the minimal amount of collateral damage, the minimal amount of civilian casualties, which I think is an important point to note, because as we have throughout in the overall Afghanistan-Pakistan effort sought to reduce civilian casualties and collateral damage, this was very much an important aspect of the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final question.\xc2\xa0 That famous picture of the people watching, the White House staffers who were in that room, are they the only ones -- the ones in that picture, are they the only ones who knew what was going on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Beyond -- without getting into specifics about who -- there were others, obviously, who knew.\xc2\xa0 But it was a very, very tight group for an obvious reason, as the President made clear.\xc2\xa0 Most of his senior staff didn\'t know.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a game about who knew and who didn\'t -- because operational security was so important. And it really is, in this day and age of the kind of technology we have and how hard it is to keep something like that secret, it is really a remarkable testament to the fact that those individuals who did know in the administration -- I mean, in the White House, in the Defense Department, in the CIA, other agencies, understood how vital operational security was.\xc2\xa0 And there were no leaks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is important not like -- there are leaks every day of information and we get frustrated by it.\xc2\xa0 But this had -- would have had consequences that would have been terrible, because obviously any leak would have meant that Osama bin Laden would have been on the run again and perhaps at large again for a long time.\xc2\xa0 So it was -- the secrecy here, the operational security here was vital to the success of the operation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, polls indicate the President has gotten a political bounce from dealing with bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Would you hope to use that as you address other issues?\xc2\xa0 And what other issues?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are -- our agenda, the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, has not changed at all in the last eight days.\xc2\xa0 This was on his agenda, very high up, getting Osama bin Laden, but there are a lot of other issues.\xc2\xa0 One of the things I think I mentioned early on last week was how amazed I was by the fact that on the Monday after Osama bin Laden was eliminated, we had a meeting I was in that was policy-focused on a non-national security issue for 90 minutes with the President, and bin Laden was never mentioned -- less than 24 hours after the event.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to me that represents -- I mean, that indicates how -- the velocity of events here, the number of high-priority and serious issues that are on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and the things he wants to get done.\xc2\xa0 So it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Vice President doing -- working on the talks with Congress to lead to substantial further deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to deal with raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing a host of other issues, focusing principally on the economy and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s not taking his foot off the pedal on any of those issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect bin Laden to have an impact on those things?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I leave that for you and political analysts to judge about whatever impact it might have.\xc2\xa0 What I know is that he\xe2\x80\x99s just continuing to go about the business that he was engaged in before the bin Laden operation.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously -- I mean, we obviously think that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a takeaway from it, it is the resolve that he has, the focus he brings to bear on long-term objectives, that he keeps pushing to get them done -- talking about immigration reform, keeps pushing to get it done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that that was reflected in his approach to dealing with Osama bin Laden, the fact that years had passed in the effort to find him and bring him to justice, and he made clear when he came into office that he wanted to look again at the intelligence, reinvigorate the effort, not assume that he could never be found, but quite the contrary, insist that he be found.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of focus is the focus he brings to bear on the priorities that he sets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, last month several dozen Republican lawmakers wrote to the President requesting assurances that the U.S. will not share sensitive missile defense technology with the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his position on this?\xc2\xa0 I think this is in context of the missile defense in Europe --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of the START Treaty or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 If you want to touch base with me afterwards, we can look into it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Chuck.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there new concerns inside the administration that if Pakistan couldn\xe2\x80\x99t detect Osama bin Laden within their borders, that they can keep their nuclear arsenals safe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously take the issue of nuclear proliferation very seriously.\xc2\xa0 In my previous job with the Vice President, that was a focus point of his endeavors on nuclear security and nuclear proliferation, and we think that\'s a very important issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see a link there, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a link made internally between the issue of nuclear proliferation and security, and Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s presence in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Again, we are investigating this.\xc2\xa0 We understand the Pakistani government is investigating it, and we continue with our collaborative, cooperative relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it better to find if they were complicit or incompetent?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s better to find out what constituted the network, and then to assess that and move forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, when it comes to the deficit the President is doing two bipartisan meetings this week.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got Vice President Biden doing all these things.\xc2\xa0 It seems -- we know a pattern here:\xc2\xa0 When the President is serious about getting a piece of legislation passed he does all of these things.\xc2\xa0 When it\xe2\x80\x99s more about doing -- the timetable is much further out, we see things like he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing with immigration, which is three straight political meetings in the last week, then this tomorrow. I mean, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just -- Chuck, I just disagree.\xc2\xa0 Because I don\'t know if you were in my office asking this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that three or four or five weeks ago I had a number of reporters talk to me, and I know my colleagues, about how --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that last time you talked to John Cornyn and Jon Kyl about immigration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on a second.\xc2\xa0 About how -- the President is not really serious about long-term deficit reduction and fiscal reform.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to grab the tail of that tiger.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too hard.\xc2\xa0 Well, you know what?\xc2\xa0 He is serious, and he is addressing it.\xc2\xa0 And the same is true for immigration.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is -- the most valuable --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would be the best evidence that he\xe2\x80\x99s serious about getting something passed in Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The most valuable commodity that exists in the West Wing is the President\xe2\x80\x99s time, as you know.\xc2\xa0 Everybody here knows.\xc2\xa0 And just look at how much time he\xe2\x80\x99s dedicating to immigration reform, and that should tell you how seriously he is approaching this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, he can\xe2\x80\x99t -- unfortunately, the world we live in, a President -- just like you guys, we can\xe2\x80\x99t just do one issue.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do one issue this month.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be great?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got to do fiscal reform.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got to do immigration.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got to continue the fight against terrorism, continue with his national security issues.\xc2\xa0 And immigration remains a high priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is doubting the President\xe2\x80\x99s time, but it seems as if there is just -- that this is just looking -- talking to supporters, just looking to figure out a way to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I think I addressed this --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to talk to people who agree with this position.\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But it seems that if it\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of legislation -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk to Cornyn and Kyl, who are the two people that might be standing in the way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we already know from the first two years, the last Congress, that there was political opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, including from some places where there used to be political support.\xc2\xa0 We are endeavoring to change that dynamic by rallying public support, by raising public awareness about the need for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And again, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude -- obviously, there will be a time for consultations with the lawmakers you mentioned, but just sitting in a room with some lawmakers is not going to get you any closer to that legislation than it did in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you need to -- again, the President would not be dedicating this amount of time to it if he didn\'t believe it was a high priority.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- having covered this place through two administrations, this is the coin of the realm. The President -- you can judge how seriously the White House takes an issue by how much time the President is focusing on it. And I think that\'s sort of end of argument.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this have to be decided -- is it going to take a ballot box decision to push --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that what you guys are assuming or preparing for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Preparing to have this debate played out in the ballot box?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Robert said he\xe2\x80\x99d leave me a crystal ball, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found it yet.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Continuing on the subject, the Republicans who are standing in the way of this right now say that the administration needs to do more to secure the border.\xc2\xa0 The administration has actually done several things to secure the border, but do you think that these demands from Senators Kyl and McCain are reasonable and can be met?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think that they\'re -- do you dismiss them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, I appreciate acknowledging as you did that we have done many substantial things in terms of border security.\xc2\xa0 I could go through the list again, but I think they appeared earlier in this briefing.\xc2\xa0 And we take border security very seriously.\xc2\xa0 Comprehensive includes security as a major component, and that\'s part of the reform that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking to achieve.\xc2\xa0 But it also -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not security alone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe comprehensive nature requires that you take in all the elements and see the benefits of immigration reform, which include some of the economic things I mentioned before.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Bill Gates -- the United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete.\xc2\xa0 There is an economic imperative here to get this done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you -- it sounds like what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying when you say \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d includes security, is that the legislation should include a security --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve always taken has included security as part of it.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to break it apart because we think it needs to move comprehensively.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What their argument is -- and I want to find out just a direct response to this -- is you need to do the border security first.\xc2\xa0 Essentially they\xe2\x80\x99re saying we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to even move on anything involving the guest worker program or the path to citizenship until the border is secure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that prior to -- back when some leading Republican lawmakers supported immigration reform, this is what has happened since then on border security\xc2\xa0 -- doubling of the number of patrol agents on the border, tripling the number of intelligence analysts working the border. That\'s just since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been around.\xc2\xa0 Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles that now patrol the border from Texas to California,\xc2\xa0 and a fence that was demanded back in 2007 is now basically complete.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, these are substantial actions that have been taken since there was broader support for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So we have acted specifically on border security alone. We think that border security needs to be part of the immigration package, a comprehensive package, and we believe that we have to move forward in total.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you believe they\xe2\x80\x99re moving the goalposts on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just think we need to all work together, focus on the imperative here, and get the job done that the American people want us to get done.\xc2\xa0 This is a classic case of cannot do it with one party, have to do it in a bipartisan way, and it requires focus, it requires education on the issues, and persistence.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re providing as much of those three things as we can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be crystal-clear, you would say that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough on border security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to move on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work on border security, but we believe that comprehensive immigration reform should be comprehensive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said this trip tomorrow and the recent meetings the President has had were aimed at generating pressure on Congress.\xc2\xa0 Bottom line here, realistically what are the odds for the DREAM Act or the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not an odds maker or a crystal ball reader.\xc2\xa0 I think that the -- what were the odds --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used to be when you were over here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I used to do that a lot.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And nobody --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the prospects for passage of any --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The great thing is you could go on television and predict something, and nobody held you accountable.\xc2\xa0 It was awesome.\xc2\xa0 But --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this pre-election year, what are the prospects for passage of any meaningful immigration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a percentage figure for you.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s important, the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 The sooner it gets done, the better for the country, for the economic reasons that I mentioned, for the security reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What were the odds that we\xe2\x80\x99d get the tax cut deal that we got?\xc2\xa0 What were the odds that we\xe2\x80\x99d get the kind of deficit reduction we got in the CR debate?\xc2\xa0 What are the odds that we\xe2\x80\x99d get the kind of agreement that we hope to get out of the negotiations being led by the Vice President?\xc2\xa0 We are congenital optimists here and we think we have reason to believe that our optimism is merited.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes -- nothing?\xc2\xa0 Mara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said in a couple of his immigration appearances that he\xe2\x80\x99s refocusing the deportation policy away from students to criminals.\xc2\xa0 Has that happened?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the evidence of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have data for you, Mara.\xc2\xa0 I encourage you to -- I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the data, so --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the big demands of the Hispanic groups is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not been --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- speaking broadly, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the data in front of me, I believe that is the case, but I would encourage you to talk to DHS and ICE about the figures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the debt ceiling negotiations, now that it seems like the parameters have narrowed a bit on what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, can you give us a kind of update on what\xe2\x80\x99s expected to come out of the meeting tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- anymore than I would have predicted a celebration of comprehensive agreement out of one meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict that would happen out of a second meeting.\xc2\xa0 But what we did see was progress.\xc2\xa0 We did see I think a recognition by both -- or all sides that the issues here are important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you step back and look -- how do you get hard things done when you have opposing sides?\xc2\xa0 Well, a major step is agreeing on the problem.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t solve a problem if you don\xe2\x80\x99t all agree what the problem is.\xc2\xa0 We agree there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.\xc2\xa0 We agree we need to deal with this.\xc2\xa0 Then you step back and say, well, what\xe2\x80\x99s your target for solving the problem?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your goal?\xc2\xa0 Now, the details of how you get there are complicated, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to negotiate them -- but what\xe2\x80\x99s your goal?\xc2\xa0 Well, we have that as well, $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the elements that contribute to our long-term deficit and debt problem?\xc2\xa0 We all, well, largely all recognize what those elements are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the elements are off the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have also said, what the President has said and others have said, is that this is -- again, the reason why this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been resolved in so long is because it\xe2\x80\x99s hard and it takes time.\xc2\xa0 And it may be the case that all of these issues do not get resolved in these negotiations, but a number of them can.\xc2\xa0 If we find common ground on those issues where we agree, we can achieve significant further deficit reduction -- a good thing -- and then if there are other issues that remain unresolved, we\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with them when there is the environment that\xe2\x80\x99s conducive to dealing with them.\xc2\xa0 But we remain optimistic that significant progress can be made from these talks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, the fact that Medicare reform is not on the table now, is that a helpful thing or not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you mean -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about -- obviously I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports about what some Republican leaders have said about their specific proposal for ending Medicare as we know it or reforming Medicare in the way that we think would end Medicare -- certainly end the guarantee.\xc2\xa0 How that plays out in these talks I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe obviously recognize, and have from the beginning -- the President has -- that one of the major drivers of our long-term deficit and debt problems is entitlement spending.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s, through the Affordable Care Act, through his own budget proposals, through his broad fiscal reform plan, has addressed the need for reductions in entitlement spending.\xc2\xa0 We just have a different approach because we believe that you have to maintain the Medicare guarantee for our seniors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what remains on and off the table is something for them to decide.\xc2\xa0 What we want to see is obviously as much successful deficit reduction as we can, where we can find common ground in a way that protects our seniors, maintains the investments that are vital to continue the economic growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen coming out of this recession, and continue the job growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as recently as Friday with a decent private sector job growth report.\xc2\xa0 So those are the parameters that we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing to the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Perry Bacon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to the Pakistani decision to leak the name of the U.S. station chief in Islamabad to the press there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction.\xc2\xa0 No comment on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is the second time in six months that that\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 Is there a pattern there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction or comment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have any reason to doubt that they put it out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jackie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ann.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to make sure that the reward money for Osama bin Laden is given to someone who has helped find him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me step back.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m aware, no one knowledgably said, oh, Osama bin Laden is over here in Abbottabad at 5703 Green Avenue.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\xc2\xa0 -- my sense is that the requirement for any kind of reward is to say that, not to accidentally, through intelligence gathering, provide information that leads to the whereabouts of somebody like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last October the President went into the Roosevelt Room where a group of very high-ranking Pakistani delegation was there and he said, I will go to Pakistan in 2011.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that is still his intention?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Tom Donilon said yesterday that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a trip like that on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule prior to this raid; we don\xe2\x80\x99t have one now.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates or announcements to make about a trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has this changed or ruined his expectation --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow Air Force One will carry the President 37,000 feet over the very swollen, dangerously swollen Mississippi River.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard you mention any briefings that the President has gotten on lives at jeopardy and a great deal of physical destruction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has been regularly updated on this these terrible floods.\xc2\xa0 And our thoughts are with all the families, communities, and first responders affected by the flooding along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and their many tributaries that have been threatening lives and property.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, FEMA has been working closely, monitoring the ongoing flood fight along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, their tributaries, and other low-lying areas.\xc2\xa0 FEMA, through its regional offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Denton, Texas, and Kansas City, Missouri, remains in close contact and coordination with our state and local partners in all of the areas affected by or potentially impacted by flooding.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On May 6th, just a few days ago, President Obama declared emergency declarations for Louisiana, which allows for emergency measures to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the designated areas.\xc2\xa0 On May 4th, as you know, President Obama declared emergency -- made emergency declarations for Mississippi and Tennessee, and a major disaster declaration for Kentucky, which will allows for additional federal support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we flew in and out of Fort Campbell, we could even see some of the flooding still in the fields out there, and it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously of grave concern to us.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he stop there --<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move around the room a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about the reasoning behind the decision to release those videos of bin Laden --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- specifically the one where he was watching himself on TV?\xc2\xa0 Was there an attempt to kind of undercut the image of himself that he had created and to kind of suggest that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this great rebel leader or revolutionary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The point of releasing them was to prevent the release of videos in the future that would allow al Qaeda -- give al Qaeda some sort of propaganda achievement; to make the point that we got these, procured these at the compound where bin Laden was living and that we know now what he was up to.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why, in all cases.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, in terms of the specific video you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing, I think it was just that the overall reason was what I just described.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to passenger rail -- issues of passenger rail here in this country.\xc2\xa0 Since 9/11 we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen passenger rails with organic or metal detection units there.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the conversation this administration is having with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s passenger rail system, as we have seen passenger rail be attacked in Spain -- in Madrid, and in the tube in London, and there are threats that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, for details I encourage you to check with DHS.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we take the issue of passenger rail safety very seriously and we have -- which is why the first bit of information the public got about the intelligence gathered in bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound was for DHS to put out the alert that it did, in reference to the consideration of an attack on the rail system back in February of 2010.\xc2\xa0 No specific or imminent threat, but enough of a concern to put out that alert.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we continue to work in ways, seen and unseen, to ensure that rail travel remains safe for Americans, and we are hyper-vigilant as ever, but even more so in the wake of obviously this significant mission and its success because of the potential for revenge attacks or anything like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why has this nation gone so long seeing passenger rail since 2011 not have those metal detection units and stepped-up security?\xc2\xa0 Why is that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there has been stepped-up security as anyone who travels by rail knows, certainly since 2001.\xc2\xa0 And there are measures that are taken -- seen and unseen\xc2\xa0 -- every day to improve our security -- transportation security by rail, as well as by air.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know anything more specific than that for you, but we are obviously very vigilant about this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also what about the Congressional Black Caucus meeting this week with the President -- with the full caucus membership meeting with the President, especially after they met with Daley last week?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that meeting about this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specifics for you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will talk about the agenda going forward that the President has and the ideas that they have, the members have, but I don\'t have any specific information on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the government of Bahrain is bulldozing dozens of Shiite Muslim mosques.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken out, you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken from the podium about the governments of Libya and Syria. Why no comment on what Bahrain is doing to Shiite Muslims?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have said -- I don\'t have a comment specifically on the action you describe, but we obviously urge the government of Bahrain, as we have governments in the region, to engage in political dialogue with political opposition and -- peaceful political dialogue because that\'s the key to long-term stability.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the way to address the concerns and aspirations of the people in their countries, and we would urge that again.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a specific reaction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- you\'re not equating bulldozing of the mosques to political dialogue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we -- just the opposite, Steve.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we -- that the actions we would encourage governments in the region to take are entirely peaceful and non-physical and would be aimed at fostering political dialogue and reconciliation with opposition groups to ensure that the governments are more responsive and that the people\xe2\x80\x99s grievances are heard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on the rail question.\xc2\xa0 Chuck Schumer has a suggestion about a \xe2\x80\x9cdo not ride\xe2\x80\x9d list for Amtrak.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any take on that?\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up -- or not a follow-up, a second question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a take on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been discussion of an executive order for an element of the DISCLOSE Act.\xc2\xa0 Will we see any action?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been rumors that\'s going to happen soon. Are we looking at this week?\xc2\xa0 Is this --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timetable for action for you.\xc2\xa0 I will remind you that this is a draft that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, and drafts tend to change -- or can change.\xc2\xa0 More broadly, this goes back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that in terms of campaign finance, disclosure is very important.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way for the American people to know who is funding political campaigns.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re going to do something then, it\xe2\x80\x99s just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have anything -- all I have said is that there is a draft.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I don\'t have any announcements to make about any timing for further action on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Gilani\xe2\x80\x99s speech would seem to indicate that the Pakistani government feels its reputation is being besmirched without anybody in the administration actually saying that right now.\xc2\xa0 Do you have some understanding, does the administration have some understanding of how they might feel, especially considering what\xe2\x80\x99s being said up on Capitol Hill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and others have said, we completely understand Pakistani concerns.\xc2\xa0 We understand the uniqueness of an operation like this, but we make no apologies for the fact that Osama bin Laden needed to be found and brought to justice, and that\'s what we did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President -- this was not a surprise to anyone who has followed what the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are on this issue for many, many years.\xc2\xa0 He said back during the campaign -- and took a lot of heat for it when he suggested that if he, as President, had actionable intelligence on bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts in Pakistan, he would go in and bring bin Laden to justice.\xc2\xa0 And he said that repeatedly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I understand about the concerns.\xc2\xa0 We are, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said earlier in answer to other questions, in regular and constant communication with Pakistani leaders in the government at various levels, discussing our relationship and the need for continued relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the reputation of the government with a lot of implications that somebody in the government had to know where he was.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would point you to what the National Security Advisor said yesterday, again, based on his assessment as of that interview about that issue.\xc2\xa0 And in general, we obviously are interested in discovering what was involved in the support network for bin Laden, as the Pakistani government has said it is interested.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stepping back from that, I would just say that we appreciate the support we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from Pakistan in the past, the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past in helping us take on the terrorist threat, a threat that affects both our countries.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to look forward -- we look forward to continued cooperation in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Andre --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 First, I wanted to ask you to give me also Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s close to Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question about the missile defense.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, if you will be giving it to him, please give it to others, too, myself included.\xc2\xa0 Second of all, I wanted to ask you if you have anything on V-Day in Europe, which is today in Russia -- May 9th, as you remember, the anniversary --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been to a few parades in my day.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was that again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to a few parades on this day in the past.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything specific, except obviously that this was -- that the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe was an important achievement for both countries and all the allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, thirdly, the National Journal said recently that the overall cost of tracking down and eliminating bin Laden now was over $3 trillion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea about that estimate, but I think most Americans would feel that it was worth every penny.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:50 P.M.
