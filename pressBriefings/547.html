Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:00 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon -- or good morning, and happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\xc2\xa0 Actually, I have no announcements to make so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask a couple questions about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Syria talks in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 I get that the U.S. thinks that this is going to be a difficult process, but what should we read into the prospect for anything coming from this when the Russians don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to agree with the U.S. on the actual purpose being there?\xc2\xa0 They say that this is not just for finding a transitional government in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, everyone who signed onto the idea of the Geneva Communique understands and understood what the purpose was and is.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that the talks thus far have not produced significant breakthroughs, but it is important that everyone recognize that the only resolution to this conflict comes through a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are going to continue to pressure not just the Assad regime but also countries like Russia and Iran to recognize that it is in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see the continuing bloodshed and collapse that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place inside Syria.\xc2\xa0 Now, the President said last week that this is a difficult process and we are far from achieving the goal we envision here.\xc2\xa0 But we have to keep at it.\xc2\xa0 There is no other way to resolve this ongoing crisis that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve the two sides sitting across from each other at a table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this process actually backtracking, moving backwards, if you say that everyone came to the table agreeing that this was about finding some kind of transitional body to run Syria and now you have the Russians saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point of the talks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would say that we recognize that significant progress is not being achieved but it is important that the talks themselves have taken place.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to continue to press all sides, all parties to this to recognize that there is no other way out of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that the main problem is the regime\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness so far to engage constructively on the implementation of the Geneva Communique, which, as I said earlier, is the foundation of the talks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The opposition, by contrast, has shown a seriousness of purpose.\xc2\xa0 They continue to outline their vision for the future of Syria, and we commend them for that.\xc2\xa0 They have shown that they are willing to engage constructively for the sake of the Syrian people, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that kind of engagement from the regime so far.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we recognize the situation in Syria continues to be terrible for the people of Syria.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts, including our humanitarian efforts, our efforts at the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution that would make it easier to deliver humanitarian aid, our efforts on behalf of the opposition are all aimed towards bringing about a transition in Syria that will lead to a better future for the country.\xc2\xa0 There is no other way to get from here to there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just quickly, I think in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks just now, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up fast track for the trade agreements in his remarks to Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Is that something he still believes is realistic this year or whenever these deals are ready to take that plunge?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position has not changed.\xc2\xa0 It has long been the case -- Major and I know, Ann and I know -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call out a few veterans -- that this has been an issue that has never been easy for either party, in fact.\xc2\xa0 There are divisions on these issues in both parties.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to press forward, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out why we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American economy and American workers to expand trade in the way that the TPP would do with our Asia partners.\xc2\xa0 We have to remember that this is the fastest-growing part of the world, and we, the United States, need to be there and taking advantage of that growth on behalf of the American economy, on behalf of American workers.\xc2\xa0 But these are obviously always issues that require a lot of discussion and consideration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Syria for a second, Secretary Kerry apparently told reporters in Beijing that the President has asked for other options on Syria.\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by that?\xc2\xa0 What other options could there be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry was reiterating what has always been the case, which is that the President is always looking at options on policy matters like Syria -- that include Syria.\xc2\xa0 But as a general principle, the President is always asking his team to evaluate where we are and where we could be.\xc2\xa0 This is not a one-time thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like this is a new review.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly -- he is constantly tasking his national security team with the job of evaluating where we are, evaluating what options might be available to him going forward.</p>\n<p>He acknowledges, as I just said to Julie, that the situation in Syria is terrible for the people of Syria.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing for the region.\xc2\xa0 We are aggressive in our pursuit of providing humanitarian aid to the Syrian people and in supporting the opposition and in pressing for progress through the Geneva process.\xc2\xa0 But he is always looking at other options -- or always asking for all the options that might be available to him.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see this as some new announcement or new consideration.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a reflection of the frustrations and difficulties in talks --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there is certainly frustration.\xc2\xa0 But I would say, regardless of where we were in the process the President as a starting principle on these issues, always tasks his teams both on foreign policy and domestic to not be complacent about the path forward -- \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re on this track; is that the track we have to stay on\xe2\x80\x9d -- always, he says, consider other options if other better options become available.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, I want to make it clear this is not a new perspective that the President is bringing to this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the perspective he has had all along.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, President Karzai has said the release of the controversial detainees is of no concern to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are disappointed.\xc2\xa0 And I think the U.S. military has made clear that we are disappointed that the Afghan government released detainees that we believe pose a continuing threat to coalition forces and to Afghans.\xc2\xa0 We urge the Afghan government to make every effort that those released do not commit new acts of violence and terror and to immediately bring to justice any who do so.\xc2\xa0 And we strongly urge the Afghan government to come to an appropriate resolution for the remaining disputed cases, including more serious consideration by Afghan prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask -- the President praised the Democrats for unity in the face of debt limit talks just now in Cambridge, Maryland.\xc2\xa0 One issue that the President has advanced that\xe2\x80\x99s caused some heartburn among his allies is this changes to cost of living for Social Security, the so-called chained CPI. In the interest of harmony, is he going to relinquish that request going forward this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve already announced will be the presentation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 So I know that\xe2\x80\x99s a way of asking what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the budget.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the President has demonstrated in the past and will continue to demonstrate his commitment to achieving additional deficit reduction that addresses our medium- and long-term challenges through a balanced approach.</p>\n<p>The budgets he has put forward in the past, the offers he has made in the past reflect that willingness, a willingness to compromise, to give as well as receive, that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen demonstrated thus far by Republicans, and I think most people in this room have reported as much.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a way of describing the point of view that the President brings to these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Afghanistan, I know this administration is weighing what force level to contribute to Afghanistan, pending a signature to this bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this give you some pause when it comes to committing troops long term or even short term to Afghanistan when dangerous prisoners are being released?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we definitely expressed -- as I just did today, and others have, including military leaders -- our disappointment with the release of detainees that we believe pose a threat to U.S. forces, coalition forces and Afghan forces, as well as Afghan civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the matter of the bilateral security agreement, we continue to seek a conclusion to that process promptly.\xc2\xa0 And then, on the question of troop presence beyond 2014, it is obviously contingent upon -- any presence is contingent upon the signing of the BSA.\xc2\xa0 And we are still not at a point where a decision has been made or can be made about what a post-2014 troop presence would look like, except to say that it would be much smaller and narrowly focused on two missions, counterterrorism and training in support of Afghan forces.</p>\n<p>So those views remain the same.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we are disappointed, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to the enrollment numbers yesterday, there have been some reports that a significant number of consumers, enrollees, have not been making their premium payments to activate their coverage.\xc2\xa0 Might that affect the actual number of enrollees?\xc2\xa0 When the administration says 3.3 million people so far, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a sizeable portion of those folks who haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid their premiums, might that number actually be lower?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in this room in the past, including this week, the contract between an individual and an insurance company is a private contract.\xc2\xa0 That is something that is determined by the insurance company and the enrollee.\xc2\xa0 Right now, insurance companies, for that reason, have the most up-to-date, comprehensive, and reliable information on the number of people who have paid their premiums.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you saw in one newspaper several major insurance companies have indicated that a high percentage of people have, in fact, paid for their plans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there are thousands -- going back again and looking at this more broadly -- there are thousands of insurance plans being sold across the country and eventually all of these plans will report to CMS the total number of enrollees who have paid for their premiums.\xc2\xa0 Right now, the insurers have, the issuers have the most up-to-date, comprehensive information.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to payments, the roll that CMS plays is the issuance of the payment of tax credits and subsidies for those who qualify for them, so that subsidize the policies that enrollees have signed up for when they qualify for a subsidy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there\xe2\x80\x99s an automated payment system that will be coming online fully in the next several months, which will include in the flow of information more specific, timely data relating to the payment of premiums by enrollees provided by the insurance company, which is just a way of saying we will -- CMS will have concrete and timely data on those who have paid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Right now, that information is most reliably provided by issuers who have -- I think citing this -- I think it was a New York Times article reported that a very high percentage have been meeting their premium deadlines.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of those 3.3 million people that the administration said have enrolled in plans, do you know if all 3.3 million have made their payments?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the issuers are the ones who have the most specific information about who has met their payments, and, again, citing a recent report, that figure is 80 percent or above for the major issuers that are cited in that newspaper article.\xc2\xa0 We are working on an automated payment processing system that will be set up as part of the CMS system and which, when it is online and functional, will result in having -- even though it\xe2\x80\x99s set up so that there\xe2\x80\x99s an automated system for the payment of the subsidies to the issuers -- it will also in the return information provide more data to CMS about who more specifically has met their premiums, what percentage of enrollees have met their premiums.</p>\n<p>Overall, I know there is a constant search for less than good news in the healthcare.gov arena, but if you look at the data reported, it is overwhelmingly positive, and the predictions of failure and doom and gloom that we saw -- understandably, perhaps, given how rocky the start was in October and November -- have all come to naught.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there has been a significant increase in enrollees.\xc2\xa0 The website is working effectively for the vast majority of people who use it to peruse their options and then select a plan. The breakdown demographically that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of enrollees continues to meet expectations, and we saw a surge in youth -- our young American, young adult enrollees in January.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we expect that, come March 31st, we will have a significant number of Americans who have purchased plans, enrolled in plans, signed up for plans through the marketplaces, through the exchanges, and that the demographic breakdown will be well within what we had hoped to see in order for the marketplaces to function effectively.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Looking forward to California on a couple of issues -- what is the Climate Resilience Fund that the President is going to be proposing?\xc2\xa0 Will he be mentioning that today?\xc2\xa0 And is the billion dollars for it something that he could do through administrative executive action, or would that be a request of Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will, as I think information provided to you this morning made clear, announce today that his budget will include a new $1 billion Climate Resilience Fund.\xc2\xa0 And this is part of a broader approach to dealing with the challenge represented by climate change that the President put forward in his Climate Action Plan.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Fresno will demonstrate his concern about the communities across California that are struggling with the impacts of one of the state\xe2\x80\x99s worst droughts in over a hundred years.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to ensuring that his administration is doing everything it can to help farmers, ranchers, small businesses and communities that are being affected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will today announce significant new efforts the administration is taking to provide support and relief to those feeling the pain of the drought.\xc2\xa0 We put out a full list of these new commitments, but among them are speeding up the delivery of up to $100 million in livestock disaster assistance for California producers from the farm bill.\xc2\xa0 While these livestock programs took over a year to get assistance out the door under the last farm bill, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, USDA has committed to cut that time by more than 80 percent, and begin signup in April.</p>\n<p>Also, $15 million in targeted conservation assistance for the most extreme and exceptional drought areas, and $60 million made available to food banks in the state of California to help families that may be economically affected by the drought.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s into his sixth year as President.\xc2\xa0 Does he think anything that the administration has been able to accomplish in the first five years has even mitigated the effects of either the California drought or the other climate impact?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We put in place historic fuel efficiency standards that outside analysts will attest will have a greater positive impact on carbon emissions than almost any other policy that one could imagine.\xc2\xa0 But the President is not done in addressing this challenge and that was reflected in his Climate Action Plan that he laid out last year and in the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to take.</p>\n<p>The Climate Resilience Fund is a piece of that.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s always discussion about severe weather and its relationship to global climate change -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s make clear, no single episode of weather, no storm, no flood, no drought can be said to have been caused by climate change, global climate change, but the science is clear that weather practically everywhere is being influenced by climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always had heat waves, but now the worst ones are longer and they\xe2\x80\x99re hotter.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve always had droughts, but the worst ones are getting longer and dryer.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve always had severe storms, but instead of hundred-year storms that happen once in a hundred years, we\xe2\x80\x99re having hundred-year storms that happen every other year or every five years.\xc2\xa0 And the severity of the storms, I think we all note from having experienced them or seen the reporting on them, has been significant.\xc2\xa0 Sandy is a perfect example.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of the steps that we need to take and that this President is committed to taking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quickly on the dinner tonight, is there a reason why he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with King Abdullah in California since the King has been here this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked this the other day, Ann, as you probably know, and the President looks forward very much to holding a working dinner with King Abdullah of Jordan at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands.\xc2\xa0 Jordan is an invaluable ally and a close friend of the United States, and Sunnylands offers a private location and less formal setting that will allow the President to have a wide-ranging discussion with the King. \xc2\xa0This meeting is a demonstration of the strength of our partnership with Jordan and our friendship with King Abdullah and the people of Jordan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President looks forward to discussing with King Abdullah opportunities to promote peace, prosperity and reform.\xc2\xa0 He will also discuss opportunities to discuss -- to strengthen, rather, the U.S.-Jordan strategic partnership and how to advance our political, economic and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders will also continue consultations on regional developments, including Middle East peace and, of course, Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a specific new initiative or announcement out of their talks tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the President.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President looks forward to hearing how the King has advanced Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political stability since their last meeting, and how the U.S. can further support the King\xe2\x80\x99s vision for Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The two leaders will also discuss the United States\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to assisting Jordan meet its economic challenges this year.\xc2\xa0 Among them, on Syria, we are committed to working with Jordan to support the more than 600,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan and Jordanian host communities, and we are working together at the U.N., where Jordan is on the Security Council, to press for greater humanitarian access inside Syria.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. and Jordan both strongly support the Geneva II process and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Of course, Jordan is a key stakeholder in the Middle East peace process so you can expect a discussion on those issues and you can expect the President to convey again his deep appreciation for the King\xe2\x80\x99s support for the negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there will be a variety of issues discussed, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to preview.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it time for this administration to reevaluate the utility of the Geneva process itself, that it may not actually be what it thought it was going inthat everyone is agreed on a central set of goals and timetables -- that the Syrians are just playing\xc2\xa0 for time, continuing their humanitarian assault on the civilians, calling everyone in any disputed territory a terrorist -- even an unarmed civilian, who is now starving -- that they\xe2\x80\x99re just playing for time and stringing this out, and the process itself, though we\xe2\x80\x99re invested in it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t a legitimate process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly identified that this is a very difficult situation and that the Geneva process has not provided a solution to the conflict.\xc2\xa0 What has not been identified in your question or in other assessments of where we are in the process is a better alternative to finding a resolution to the conflict that allows for a transition for Syria.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, we are committed to this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We recognize that there is no other way to find a political solution -- or rather there is no other resolution to the conflict that does not include a political settlement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Geneva process is important.\xc2\xa0 As I just said in answer I think to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question or Mark\xe2\x80\x99s, we are going to continue to pressure not just the Assad regime but also to get countries like Russia and Iran to recognize that it is in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see the continuing bloodshed and collapse that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in Syria.</p>\n<p>But, absolutely, Major, this continues to be a very difficult issue and the President is committed through our support -- our leading role in providing humanitarian aid and our significant support for the opposition, as well as our leading role in helping bring about a political resolution, to try to make progress on this very difficult problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when we ask about options, I understand the President always is asking for options -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process for any President.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if these things are sort of coming together that what the President -- or has the President asked for a better alternative?\xc2\xa0 As you just said, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a better alternative than Geneva currently.\xc2\xa0 Has he asked his staff, has he asked the people who are devoting a tremendous amount of attention to this to try to find a better alternative?\xc2\xa0 Have we reached that stage?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re always at the stage where the President is asking for his teams to consider where we are and what the options are for getting where we need to be -- in Syria and in other issues around the world, and in domestic policy.\xc2\xa0 So I was just trying to put into context the question about Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, which were wholly accurate, but that is a reflection of where the President always is and has been on Syria.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take options off the table.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about not engaging militarily directly in a civil war in Syria, putting boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Others may disagree with that position, but the President has been clear about it.\xc2\xa0 But as a general principle, with Syria and other issues like this, he retains all options.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just take three things that have happened since the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 One, at the State of the Union, the President says, pass fast track.\xc2\xa0 The very next day, Harry Reid says, I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in it, I\xe2\x80\x99m burying it.\xc2\xa0 This week, the House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in favor of the Camp-Baucus bill, the only existing legislative vehicle for fast track.\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up at his caucus meeting with the House Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Taken together, can\xe2\x80\x99t we all fairly conclude that this is now on the backburner and whatever push the President hoped to initiate at the State of the Union is, for the moment, completely derailed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said at the time, the idea that there is some opposition within the Democratic Party historically and traditionally to fast track is not a new discovery.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t new last week, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t new in 1993, and it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been new any time in the interim --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know, in 1993, President Clinton, when confronting that, amped it up, increased the pressure, demonstrated over time intensity on the issue.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying is the President backing off now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, what I can tell you is the President made clear in his State of the Union address that he has an agenda driven by the need to expand opportunity and assist the middle class and to reward hard work and responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And his economic agenda includes that piece of -- does include the piece that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, but also includes many others.</p>\n<p>Something else has happened since the State of the Union address is that House Republicans abandoned their gamesmanship that had threatened the American economy, threated the American middle class, threatened default for the first time in our history, and passed a clean debt limit, a raising in the clean debt limit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a significant change in the way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing business here in Washington for the past several years, and it is a welcome change.\xc2\xa0 It is a good thing for our economy, and I think it represents a positive step forward, a victory for the American people and the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And we saw the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about when you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just talking about when you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- have to do with the top Democratic leaders in both chambers ignoring the President\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed that issue.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that you framed it as somehow this has been the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened since the State of the Union address, which, of course, is not the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened on trade, which is my question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, nor has the fact that this is an issue that has been contentious for both parties for decades.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two quick ones, but since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the front row, if you promise to come back to me, if you can go take a few from the back, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, that is very gentlemanly of you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jared. \xc2\xa0Jared one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which one is Jared one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the climate change resilience fund, what does the White House think the chances are of Congress supporting that $1 billion fund, considering their aversion to new spending? \xc2\xa0And is there anything in particular the President is going to try and do to gain support for that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of something that the President is going to announce today and about which there will be greater detail in the coming days, except to lay out simply that the idea of a Climate Resilience Fund is something that should be, and we expect will be supported broadly across the country, because all parts of the country, generally speaking, have had to deal with and will have to deal with the need to mitigate and be resilient in the face of challenges posed by severe weather.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that obviously over the course of the five-plus years the President has been in office, and we saw it prior to that.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the evidence shows that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see it in coming years.\xc2\xa0 So the need to be prepared, the need to take steps that help our farmers and businesses and communities deal with the consequences from severe weather events is I think evident to everyone across the country -- red states, blue states, purple states, big communities, small communities, big businesses, small businesses, agriculture and the like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information for you on it, but I think this is something that touches the lives of Americans across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if lawmakers, as you said, it\xe2\x80\x99s already evident that some of these natural disasters we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing are linked to climate change, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to support measures currently, based on the Republican Party, then why would you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re broadly defining something that\xe2\x80\x99s fairly -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about cap and trade from a few years ago and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously something that is meant to deal with -- help the country deal with the impacts of global climate change.\xc2\xa0 But it is obviously --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More narrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different -- it\xe2\x80\x99s about resilience, it\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not similar to past actions necessarily.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be fair to conclude that the administration is basically out of leverage with President Karzai?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he seems to be intent on spending the last few months in power frustrating everything the U.S. and its allies is trying to work for.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been very clear that we negotiated the bilateral security agreement in good faith.\xc2\xa0 We participated in a process that saw that agreement negotiated with the Afghan government, presented to the loya jirga, where it was endorsed.\xc2\xa0 And we are frustrated by the fact that President Karzai has indicated an unwillingness to sign an agreement that has the support of the Afghan people and, obviously, we believe, is the preferable path forward in terms of our national security interests, as well as Afghan national security interests.\xc2\xa0 I think Director Clapper has spoken to this in open testimony.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So our position continues to be that the BSA ought to be signed promptly.\xc2\xa0 It is simply a fact that when you talk about the complexities of drawing down our forces and preparing for a force that would stay on should a BSA be signed, that the longer we go into 2014 the more difficult it becomes to prepare for contingencies, and the more real the contingency of no BSA and zero troops becomes.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a reality.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s where we are.</p>\n<p>We have to, both the United States and our NATO partners, plan accordingly, and it becomes more difficult to plan the longer we go without a signed BSA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, to follow up -- you said the administration wants to convince nations like Russia and Iran that it was not in their interest for this -- the crumbling in Syria to go on.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the administration is thinking about discussing this directly with Iran?\xc2\xa0 Might that be one of the options that could be developed that the President is looking at?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would stick with where I was in terms of seeking to convince nations like Russia and Iran that it is not in their interest.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not something that would be part of the -- as I understand it -- the negotiations around a six-month process that might end in an agreement with the P5-plus-1 on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>We, obviously, have a host of other issues with Iran and a host of other major disagreements with Iran and we have not changed our views on any of those.\xc2\xa0 But we communicate our views about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for Hezbollah, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing role in the region, and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing role in Syria very clearly and will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the aid that the U.S. is giving Jordan for the refugees and so forth.\xc2\xa0 When the President meets with won\'t King tonight, is he, the President, expecting any further requests from Abdullah on the refugee question, or anything else, for that matter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\'t want to get ahead of the meetings or speak for the King.\xc2\xa0 This will obviously be a topic the two Presidents -- or the President and the King discuss, the two leaders discuss.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a matter that they discussed the last time they met and is something that is a significant issue for Jordan and puts a lot of pressure on Jordan, and we have assisted Jordan in dealing with it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Any specific announcements that may or may not be made, I\'ll let the President make them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. satisfied with what it\xe2\x80\x99s currently doing with regard to the refugees?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With what -- is the U.S. satisfied with what the U.S. is doing?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure I understand the question.\xc2\xa0 We obviously recognize this is a major issue for Jordan and we discuss with the King and the Jordanian government this issue I think with great regularity and will -- we work with, as others do, with Jordan to try to mitigate the impacts of the refugee problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the U.S. be willing to do more?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a new policy announcement to make or changes in the approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to announce, but I would suggest to you that the President is meeting with the King later today and I\xe2\x80\x99ll point you to his remarks on those issues.</p>\n<p>Leslie, and then Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the trip to Fresno, has the White House taken any position yet on the House and Senate water bills and do they plan to get involved at all in ironing out any of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the House bill, we have a statement of administration policy out on that bill and you can go online and read it in full.\xc2\xa0 But the short version is that it would not alleviate the effects of California\xe2\x80\x99s current drought and would disrupt decades of work, work that supports building consensus, solutions and settlements that equitably addressed some of California\xe2\x80\x99s most complex water challenges.</p>\n<p>On the Senate bill, the Feinstein-Boxer bill, I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by progress in the Senate on efforts to ease the pain caused by drought -- by the drought.\xc2\xa0 And the Obama administration continues to do everything in its power, in coordination with the state of California, to provide relief and support to those who have been affected.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to continuing to work with the bill sponsors and other members of Congress as the process moves forward.\xc2\xa0 And we hope they move forward with this bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a, yes, you would get actively engaged in --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are actively engaged, and we support the Feinstein-Boxer effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask one other question?\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering, halfway through the Olympics, do you guys have any readout on what the President has been watching, what has he been able to catch up with?\xc2\xa0 Is he disappointed that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that many golds in the big stuff for the Americans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President I know is paying attention and cheering on American athletes.\xc2\xa0 I think in general we all should be very proud of how U.S. athletes have performed thus far and look forward to more stunning performances in the coming days -- and also to more annotated explanations of what those slopeskiers are talking about when they explain their maneuvers.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you caught some of that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool -- the \xe2\x80\x9c1920 Japan\xe2\x80\x9d or something like that.\xc2\xa0 But anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of fun, I know, for all of us.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has enjoyed it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific readout on what he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to watch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m particularly paying attention to the women\xe2\x80\x99s hockey team.\xc2\xa0 I have a second cousin on that team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping very much that they get the gold this year.</p>\n<p>Ed, I owe you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I heard you did some sledding yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Were you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You did hear I did some?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I heard.\xc2\xa0 I had a source on that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 I was out with my kids sledding yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It was a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you medal?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I most certainly did not medal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 On substance, I wanted to ask you a follow-up to Jim Acosta\xe2\x80\x99s question about health care.\xc2\xa0 It seemed like in your answer about the insurance companies, you said the backend payment systems might not be up for several months, I believe I heard you say.\xc2\xa0 And my question on that would be could that be a problem here?\xc2\xa0 Because the enrollment obviously goes through the end of March -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s several months, a few months.\xc2\xa0 How do you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 Let me explain.\xc2\xa0 This is the automated payment processing system.\xc2\xa0 The payments themselves are happening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to insurance companies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then, my question then is on the payments that you have to make I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s to the insurance company --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the ones I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- right -- for the subsidies.\xc2\xa0 My question is then there are people who the President has said need health care.\xc2\xa0 They need these subsidies, they need these tax credits in order to do that.\xc2\xa0 If that takes a few months, are they getting the money or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 The payments are happening on time.\xc2\xa0 There is an automated processing system that is not online yet, and once that automated payment processing system is online in a few months, that system will provide CMS with the kind of data that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about and CMS has been asked about, which is the overall picture of how high a percentage of enrollees have made their premium payments.\xc2\xa0 The system is designed just for the financial role that CMS or the government plays, which is to provide subsidies for those who qualify for them to the issuers.</p>\n<p>But the system is -- once we have that automated payment processing system up, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to have -- we, CMS, HHS and the federal government -- will have the data in a timely fashion on the percentages of who have actually paid their premiums.\xc2\xa0 Right now, before that system is up, the most accurate and timely information about the percentage of enrollees who have met their premium payment deadlines comes from the issuers themselves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 On executive action -- to the House Democrats, the President said again, a couple of times, to be clear, he will work with Congress when he can, as you say; other times, he will take executive action.\xc2\xa0 I also know that there have been other Presidents, Republican and Democrat, like Bill Clinton, who have used more executive orders than this President has.\xc2\xa0 Nonetheless, in the 2008 campaign, this President said again and again that he was going to \xe2\x80\x9creverse\xe2\x80\x9d that.\xc2\xa0 He used that word -- going to reverse George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions; these are damaging the country.\xc2\xa0 Why the change of heart on the idea of pulling back on executive action?\xc2\xa0 Now he seems to be full-steam ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. There is no question that this President has been judicious in his use of executive action, executive orders, and I think those numbers thus far have come in below what President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton did.\xc2\xa0 The matter the President was discussing in his campaign in 2008 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the number; it was the quality and the type of executive actions that he believed were not appropriate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And obviously he won\xe2\x80\x99t be engaging in those kinds of executive actions.\xc2\xa0 He will be engaging in executive actions, as he pledged in the State of the Union and as he has demonstrated throughout his presidency, that advance an agenda that expands opportunity and rewards hard work and responsibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t one man\xe2\x80\x99s bad executive action another man\xe2\x80\x99s good?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- George W. Bush would defend those.\xc2\xa0 Like, what would be an example that went over the top, do you think, whereas --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are numerous examples in the national security arena, and the President acted very swiftly when he took office on some of those, including torture and the like.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a more nuanced discussion of how there is a difference qualitatively, not necessarily quantitatively, because quantitatively it is true -- and it is funny to hear Republicans get upset about the suggestion that the President might use legally available authorities to advance an agenda that expands opportunity and rewards hard work and responsibility, when obviously they supported a President who used executive authorities quite widely.</p>\n<p>Jared two.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to fight that designation.\xc2\xa0 Jay, a little over two years ago, the President changed his position and supported Priorities USA Action, what most of us considered a pretty public reversal on super PAC fundraising.\xc2\xa0 In the State of the Union, campaign finance got a couple of lines.\xc2\xa0 In the readouts and public statements to congressional Democrats in the last couple of weeks, not a lot on campaign finance.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message on super PAC fundraising, especially given that, based on the January report, seems like Democrats are outraising Republicans when it comes to super PAC money?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court, in a decision he quite publicly opposed or disagreed with, has changed the environment dramatically.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the reality we live in.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s views on what we should do in terms of a policy approach have not changed, and that remains to this day.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the Supreme Court action has, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen and you have covered, changed this world rather dramatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will he use either his pen or his phone to affect change?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates.\xc2\xa0 We try to spring those on you when he has new executive actions to announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris and then Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A court yesterday ruled against Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 At least four circuit courts will be considering the issue this spring, which likely means the Supreme Court will be taking up the issue and making a decision next year.\xc2\xa0 Is the President eager for the Supreme Court to make a nationwide decision on this issue over the course of his presidency?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak hypothetically about cases the Supreme Court may or may not take.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the President supports, as he has made clear, making available to LGBT Americans the rights that we all should enjoy, and his views on same-sex marriage were I think very powerfully expressed, and he feels gratified by the enormous progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made on this issue and the change in perspective that I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen evolve across the country in a rather remarkable amount of time -- a remarkably short amount of time, which is not to say that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened earlier, but that it is, given the way these kinds of struggles for equal rights tend to play out, notable and commendable that Americans across the country have embraced this issue as strongly as they have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you anticipate the administration will participate in these cases as much as --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the right person to guess.\xc2\xa0 You might look for speculation at the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Daniel, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll wrap it up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple quick on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Just looking at Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s quote where he said -- made it very clear that if the North doesn\xe2\x80\x99t comply -- talking about China -- and come to the table, be serious about talks and to stop its own nuclear program, that China is prepared to take additional steps in order to make sure that their policy is implemented.\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this a number of times before major talks we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with Secretaries of State with China.\xc2\xa0 What possible additional steps would China be taking?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Could China take to put pressure on the North Koreans?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think China has a unique relationship with North Korea, has unique leverage and influence on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 So I think there is at least potential for a wide variety of things that Beijing could do to alter North Korean behavior potentially.\xc2\xa0 But those are discussions we have all the time with the Chinese, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about our hope and expectation that China would, in its own interest as well as the interests of the region and the world, use its unique influence and leverage to help bring about a situation where North Korea comes into compliance with its international obligations and ceases being the isolated state that it\xe2\x80\x99s become because of its failure to comply.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern about major provocation in advance or perhaps coinciding with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Asia trip in April?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of any.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are issues that we monitor very closely.\xc2\xa0 We make clear our views on actions taken by North Korea and actions that North Korea fails to take to meet its obligations.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My colleague, Eric Schultz, will be delivering the week ahead aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still putting the final touches on it and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will deliver it with accuracy and gusto.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:49 A.M.
