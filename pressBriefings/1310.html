EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Take us away.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Got nothing else in mind? \xc2\xa0You didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me -- you didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy me the time there.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No opening statements.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement that he wants to keep pushing for a broad climate bill, energy bill. \xc2\xa0Is that something that came up in the meeting? \xc2\xa0Was there any sort of new way forward? \xc2\xa0And why is he stressing this now? \xc2\xa0I mean, the bill was essentially dead for the year.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the bill is essentially dead for the year. \xc2\xa0The House passed a very strong and very comprehensive energy bill last year. \xc2\xa0The Senate is going to take up a version that is more scaled down but still has some important aspects, particularly dealing with how we deal with oil spills in the future.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that closes the door -- once a bill passes, each House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t close the door to having some sort of conference.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, let me phrase it a different way then. \xc2\xa0What does he plan to do now to push for it, as he said he wanted to do, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do up to now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, first and foremost, I mean, they talked about making sure that before the Senate leaves we get -- we do get some energy bill through the Senate. \xc2\xa0Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t really call that a broad energy bill; it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty narrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody in the meeting did. \xc2\xa0I think what -- again, what I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is what -- if you need to sneeze, go ahead. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do it the right way.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be responsible for not letting you sneeze, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sakes. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Sorry. \xc2\xa0Yes, I was going to say. \xc2\xa0No, but, again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one bill that passes the House; you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a different bill that passes the Senate. \xc2\xa0And then there will be an opportunity to reconcile those two differing bills.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is there some hope that a conference committee would produce something broad?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out. \xc2\xa0Anything else?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m good. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Ease back into it, right? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, BP has said it\xe2\x80\x99s going to offset the cost of the oil spill against its taxes. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have an opinion on that? \xc2\xa0This is legal, but is it right? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, first and foremost, American taxpayers will not be responsible for any costs related to the spill. \xc2\xa0The administration will ensure that any action that BP takes is -- respects the law as it is. \xc2\xa0And I think more than anything, Jeff, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the discussion over the past sort of 24 hours as BP has changed leadership is the role that BP has to -- in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s eye and I think in the eyes of those on the Gulf -- has to continue to play in capping the well, and then after the well is capped, for responding to the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been caused and to adequately compensate those who have been harmed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And I think more than anything, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are looking for and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the people of the Gulf are looking for, is a continued commitment by BP that even after the well is closed -- obviously right now the sealing cap remains on and by all estimations, sometime this weekend -- later in the weekend, early next week -- the next effort will be made to pump mud through the choke and kill lines and, once and for all, kill the well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This offset will cost U.S. taxpayers about $10 billion. \xc2\xa0Is that something you would prefer that they not do? \xc2\xa0If they --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would prefer that they do that. \xc2\xa0There are tax laws in this country that have been written for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But can you -- I mean, you could say to the company, we would prefer that you not do this. \xc2\xa0Will do you that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody -- Jeff, if I could wave the magic wand, we would never have had a big oil spill in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, two questions. \xc2\xa0Staying on BP for a second, now that Mr. Dudley will take over, does the President have any plans to reach out to him, to have any one-on-one meetings with him? \xc2\xa0Has the White House made any effort in that regard?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, the President had an opportunity to -- Mr. Dudley was part of the negotiations that took place here a few weeks ago. \xc2\xa0The President had an opportunity to talk to the chairman of the board yesterday about their change in leadership. \xc2\xa0And, again, our concern is not who heads BP. \xc2\xa0Mr. Hayward is leaving. \xc2\xa0The key is that BP can\xe2\x80\x99t leave, and should not leave, the Gulf. \xc2\xa0That is our viewpoint. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the viewpoint of everyone that\xe2\x80\x99s involved, that they have obligations and responsibilities as the responsible party in this instance that have to be met regardless of who the CEO is or who the chair of the company is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Surely the President, though, has an opinion on Mr. Dudley, especially if they\xe2\x80\x99ve met in person. \xc2\xa0Does the White House think this is a good choice or a bad choice?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into -- and the White House isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get into -- picking who the CEO of this company is. \xc2\xa0Our opinion of the CEO is immaterial to the notion that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold that CEO, whomever it is, and the chair and the entire board responsible for the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been caused, the obligations that they have to fulfill, the money that they will owe the federal government in penalties; the $20 billion in escrow that they will have to continue to pay into; the $100 million that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put up for rig workers as part of the oil moratorium; and also, the natural resource damage assessments, which will come a little bit later in that process. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Moving on to war funding, we heard the President publicly push for this today. \xc2\xa0Is he doing anything behind the scenes to try to get more Democrats to vote for this bill? \xc2\xa0A significant number it seems will not vote for this. \xc2\xa0Why does the White House think the party is so divided on this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a new thing. \xc2\xa0I think if you look back at war funding that goes back to six or eight years, there have been splits in the Democratic Party. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- Chairman Obey announced he was going to vote against war funding today. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an announcement, quite frankly, that he made quite some time ago. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I think the President believes that -- and talked extensively in the campaign -- about the fact that we did not have a winning strategy in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Coming into office, we spent a large chunk of time reviewing and creating a strategy that we believed had an opportunity to be successful. \xc2\xa0Those troops are on their way in and by the end of August will all be in place. \xc2\xa0And as he said in his statement, that\xe2\x80\x99s the strategy he believes Congress should in the supplemental and will approve funding for this evening.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That opposition might not be new, but the strategy is new. \xc2\xa0Should the President be doing something else to convey the message to people in his own party as to why they should support this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I will say this, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many of the Democrats that -- there are Democrats that have been opposed to involvement in Afghanistan a lot longer than we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, can I ask on BP, when the President spoke to the chairman of the board, did he express any concern or outrage about the golden parachute that Tony Hayward is getting?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout from the call. \xc2\xa0I know the call took place, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any sense of outrage? \xc2\xa0Is there going to be any pressure on BP? \xc2\xa0When people in the Gulf are suffering --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about a call I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- he\xe2\x80\x99s walking away with $18 million.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about a call I don\xe2\x80\x99t have some direct knowledge of.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, but what about your sense of -- do you have any sense of outrage?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I would have to see if it was brought up on the call. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wonder, in the Rose Garden, a couple quick things. \xc2\xa0The President was talking about how he focused on getting small business -- the small business bill through, that it\xe2\x80\x99s an urgent priority. \xc2\xa0But when Senator Reid decided to put the small business bill aside to move on to the DISCLOSE Act, the campaign finance reform bill, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that delaying getting the small business bill passed when as you\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll take that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- there\xe2\x80\x99s a small window of passage?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll take that up if -- I think the DISCLOSE Act is likely not to get cloture largely because Senator McConnell has made sure that the bill is not going to get cloture. \xc2\xa0I think the Democratic leader will likely take that bill up pretty quickly --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s spending valuable time on a bill that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pass when the President is saying he\xe2\x80\x99s got an urgent priority to get the small business bill passed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, and let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, Ed, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this bill for quite some time. \xc2\xa0Remember, if you had a nickel for every time you heard the Republicans talk about helping small business, you\xe2\x80\x99d be in the upper -- you probably are, but you\xe2\x80\x99d certainly be in the uppermost tax income bracket, right? \xc2\xa0Why then on Earth would it take a cloture vote to get additional lending to go to community banks in order to get it to small businesses to create jobs? \xc2\xa0I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0I think the notion that somehow Harry Reid has set up procedural hurdles that don\xe2\x80\x99t allow something like this to finish is -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t adequately capture sort of reality.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also in the Rose Garden, finally, the President was talking about the WikiLeaks story and was saying that one of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s brought is greater accountability to both Afghanistan and Pakistan. \xc2\xa0You said yesterday the President has also talked about no blank check for Pakistan. \xc2\xa0And yet the President a few months ago signed the Kerry-Lugar bill into law that\xe2\x80\x99s providing I think $7.5 billion of U.S. taxpayer aid to Pakistan when these documents that are leaked out are suggesting Pakistan and their intelligence service has these deep ties to the Taliban, maybe plotting attacks against U.S. soldiers, as well as Afghan leaders --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think we covered this yesterday, Ed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- which we talked about yesterday, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sound like a blank check, though, when you\xe2\x80\x99re still providing $7.5 billion to Pakistan when this is still going on?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s get Ed some -- we can get you a copy of the legislation in which -- Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you remember when we -- when this bill was happening, there was quite a bit of consternation in both of those countries about what had to be done in order to get that. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a copy of the bill so you can become more familiar --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why are they still talking to the Taliban if there\xe2\x80\x99s such a great check on Pakistan right now? \xc2\xa0Why is their intelligence service still allegedly meeting --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Ed, Ed, again, I thought we covered this fairly adequately yesterday, but --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You talked about it, but if this still -- do you think the ties are over between the Taliban and Pakistan so it\xe2\x80\x99s a done deal?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, again -- and I answered that -- can we also get Ed a transcript from yesterday? \xc2\xa0Ed, I said yesterday that -- and I think your network has likely covered the historical connection between the two. \xc2\xa0I think your network has probably also covered the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress in this relationship. \xc2\xa0But as I said yesterday -- and again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you that transcript, Ed -- nobody is here to say that all of our problems dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan are finished. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not this administration. \xc2\xa0We haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you that everything is all fine and hunky-dory. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s quite the opposite of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said. \xc2\xa0We came into office understanding that for seven years, as the President said today, a strategy had been under-resourced and under-funded, right? \xc2\xa0A commanding general sat in Afghanistan and said he needed more troops, despite the fact that no troops came, right? \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve tripled the number of troops and resources in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve created a new strategy that includes how to deal with Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to tell you, as I told you yesterday, that all our problems are solved, but we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow, Robert, please?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the Rose Garden the President mentioned that he talked to Senate Minority Leader McConnell about the lethargic pace of judicial confirmations. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he mention the possibility of making recess appointments?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0In fact, Mitch McConnell brought that up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what was said?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0They just discussed -- right now there are 12 judges that have passed the Judiciary Committee unanimously that await Senate confirmation. \xc2\xa0And the President asked Senator McConnell why those 12 judges couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be approved before the Senate left in a little more than a week, given the fact that the Judiciary Committee, which examines closely the qualifications of those nominated for judgeships -- why nobody found any objection to any of those 12. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There was some discussion -- the President was I think somewhat pointed in discussing with the Minority Leader the notion that the confirmation process is -- has broken down to a point that I think we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen in Congress dealing with the Executive Branch ever. \xc2\xa0And that was discussed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the aspects of the specific idea of having recess appointments?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0They did not get into the specifics of what that might be, but the President said his decisions on recess appointments would be made based on the decisions that the Senate minority made in clearing the nominees that this government needs in order to conduct everyday business for men and women in America.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s an open tool that he has at his disposal?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, it is up to the Minority Leader in the Senate to determine the degree to which action is undertaken on important nominees. \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve used this example before -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact timeline in front of me -- but when the head of the GSA has to get cloture, and then a vote is delayed for months and months and months, only to be approved unanimously, one has to ask, why the delay? \xc2\xa0Is there any delay -- is there any reason other than partisan politics?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to broaden that out a little bit, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned cloture votes a couple times already. \xc2\xa0This past weekend, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brought up the idea for the second time in favor of filibuster reform, and that was seconded by various Senate candidates who are running for office, as well as senators themselves. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that came up in the conversation and/or what your thoughts are on the growing support for that in the Congress?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not seen what -- I have not seen any of the specific proposals or I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked closely at them. \xc2\xa0It was not something that came up in the meeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then finally, the consumer protection agency board, I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about Elizabeth Warren, but when exactly should we expect the President to make an appointment?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact timeline. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t \xc2\xa0-- as I said here yesterday, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that an appointment is imminent.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, when the President has talked about Afghanistan in recent months it\xe2\x80\x99s been when kind of his hand was forced -- during the McChrystal situation, handover to Petreaus, and this situation --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- it\xe2\x80\x99s when there\xe2\x80\x99s news that he\xe2\x80\x99s responding to.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true, Chip. \xc2\xa0I mean, at the end of March, the President traveled to Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0That was not something we were forced to do; that was something that the President wanted to do. \xc2\xa0And then in May of this year, President Karzai visited the White House upon the President\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. \xc2\xa0That was hardly something that was foisted upon the President.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that enough? \xc2\xa0I mean, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he out there talking about this every week on something that is so important to this nation and to him personally and politically?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You know, Chip, I think the President has --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And with polls showing public support declining on a pretty steady basis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t make decisions on what we talk about based on polling.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you need the support of the American people to wage a war. \xc2\xa0And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it and you\xe2\x80\x99re losing it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Chip, we have dedicated an awful lot of time to this. \xc2\xa0I will point out, Chip, that last -- was it last week? -- the leaders of the two largest coalition members in Afghanistan, the two largest coalition partners that make up our international force there, were standing in front of you guys, took four questions, and not one of them was on Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Much, I will say, to the surprise of both myself and to my British counterpart, who, I think we both had in our segments discussions about Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>I appreciate, Chip, that the intricacies of this war have not necessarily been followed.Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We would love to have had more than two questions per side. \xc2\xa0That would have been a wonderful thing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I like that the --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Guarantee you you would have gotten an Afghan question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I like that the fifth most important topic that you had on your mind that day was the 100,000 --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember you calling on me.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m generalizing and lumping you guys all together --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Really? \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re generalizing the media? \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve never done that before.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m shocked that you would do that, accuse us all --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Shocked, shocked.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- of one person\xe2\x80\x99s sins.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s good, good. \xc2\xa0Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that you would do that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m lumping your questions in with Chip.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- come on -- now, that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0What do you mean? \xc2\xa0I just -- I generalized. \xc2\xa0You TV guys all look shiny together.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just a silly -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a silly diss, come on.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I -- go ahead, Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Chuck, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Chuck, I am deferring to you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Mark next. \xc2\xa0Jonathan. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just teasing, guys. \xc2\xa0Grow some skin that\xe2\x80\x99s a little thicker than -- look past --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a two-way street on the thick skin.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, I -- (laughter) -- I see how you were pouting just only moments ago. \xc2\xa0Please get Chuck -- (laughter.) \xc2\xa0Please, please --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I was. \xc2\xa0Everybody else seemed to be. \xc2\xa0Anyway. \xc2\xa0Actually, let me just follow on something that Chip said. \xc2\xa0Does public opinion matter in waging a war? \xc2\xa0How much does it matter in waging a war?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think that -- I think you have to -- I think obviously public opinion matters quite a bit when you have forces in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. \xc2\xa0I will say this, Chuck, at the same time you can\xe2\x80\x99t just make popular decisions. \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t just decide that if it\xe2\x80\x99s too hard to do something because public opinion is against it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d make a lot of decisions certainly when you have to deal with crises. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- so, look, obviously, while important, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the only determinative factor.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was it -- did it come up -- did the whole WikiLeaks thing and the issue of sort of the effect it could have on public opinion on the war, and therefore on members of Congress, did that come up in this meeting today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No discussion?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one more thing --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think largely, Chuck -- if I can, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s largely because, again, the content of what was in the WikiLeaks has been addressed on the record by a lot of members of this administration prior to the documents being put online.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen two sort of pieces of response on WikiLeaks from the administration. \xc2\xa0One is nothing new in there. \xc2\xa0And the second thing is that the release of this potentially put some operations in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. \xc2\xa0When you guys are looking through this, do you think that some of the level of secrecy was maybe too much, that some of this stuff that was marked top secret --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- maybe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Chuck, I got this question yesterday. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on classification. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not in danger of becoming one. \xc2\xa0I would just say this, that -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- when somebody marks something top secret or classified, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an option, right? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I mean, certainly some people I guess could go back in the annals of history and look through the classification process, but once -- look, to handle any kind of information like that within the administration requires -- you have to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a training process that goes along with handling it. \xc2\xa0There is -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen in my office and other offices, there are safes for keeping this kind of information in an office that is traveled by people other than those in the administration.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to discuss what role classification is. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly strict law. \xc2\xa0And those that have access to classified information can either comply with that law or live with the consequences of not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Something I wanted to follow up on Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0Are we to interpret the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today on energy -- so he specifically used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cenergy reform,\xe2\x80\x9d sort of saying he will accept something out of the Senate that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have climate in it, which is a little bit of a change from where you guys were six months ago -- is that fair?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Chuck, I think that if you -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an acknowledgement that you got to have 60 votes to get something through the Senate. \xc2\xa0You got to have --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you take what you can get, is what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. \xc2\xa0On energy you\xe2\x80\x99re going to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You got to have 60 votes to get your GSA nominee through the Senate, let alone a comprehensive immigration reform, so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s largely an acknowledgement that -- certainly given 41 Republican senators, there are not 60 votes for that bill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So basically you\xe2\x80\x99ll take an energy reform bill now and then go and try to do a climate bill later?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- well, no, I think the process is you get an energy bill through the Senate, then you can you conference that legislation with the House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0During lame duck?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, we could do it in September.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of during September, last week, Vice President Biden was at a fundraiser in North Carolina and he said the heavy legislative lifting was over and now was the time to sell what you have passed. \xc2\xa0Today, the President urged members of Congress not to be overwhelmed by the political season, even though he\xe2\x80\x99s actually doing a number of political events and fundraisers this week and next week. \xc2\xa0Is it realistic -- and is it even wise -- to expect Congress during a very heated political season to come back in September and do some of these big things? \xc2\xa0How realistic do you think that is?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, there -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- how many weeks they\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, but I assume they\xe2\x80\x99re coming back to do legislative business. \xc2\xa0I assume we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have debates on policy issues, some of which won\xe2\x80\x99t get finished until -- won\xe2\x80\x99t get finished in time for an election, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be the basis for some of the discussion in that election. \xc2\xa0But I think there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly work left to be done. \xc2\xa0If we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a small business bill through by the time the House and the Senate leave, the President would certainly expect that we get that done soon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the small business -- besides the small business bill, are there any actual \xe2\x80\x9cmust passes\xe2\x80\x9d on the President\xe2\x80\x99s list that he absolutely wants to get done in September and early October?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, again, I think that well before an oil spill you would have said getting energy legislation done is important. \xc2\xa0I think Speaker Pelosi made the point today that regardless of whether you have an oil spill or not, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re sending a billion dollars overseas in foreign oil, which is -- Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s legislation addresses natural gas, addresses electric cars, and obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for moving energy forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does the President still believe that a lame duck session should take up the recommendations of the deficit commission and pass what could be very monumental legislation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that once we have those recommendations, they will be considered. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the schedule of Congress will be. \xc2\xa0Look, I\xe2\x80\x99d point that Senator Cornyn just a week or so ago leaned in on the fiscal commission as a part of the solution for the deficit. \xc2\xa0So it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be simply one party that is waiting for the recommendations of a fiscal commission.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, did the Kagan nomination come up in the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 meeting?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It did not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President expect it next week, the confirmation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The confirmation that the vote will happen and that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new Supreme Court justice, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And tonight, the President is doing a DNC event and two tomorrow in New York City, and yet they\xe2\x80\x99re all closed to press coverage. \xc2\xa0Why is that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We make open the events in which the President is going to speak. \xc2\xa0I think he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking at one tomorrow; I will double-check on that one. \xc2\xa0That is open for pool coverage.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Tomorrow, on the speech on the economy, obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be talking about small business. \xc2\xa0But is he going to address the economy in a larger sense, such as the deficit numbers and the growth projections that came up in the budget review last week? \xc2\xa0Are we going to hear anything new on the economy?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President gets into the mid-session review, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0I think the President will continue to push that Congress take up and finish the small business bill. \xc2\xa0That, I think, will be the thrust of his remarks, the thrust of his remarks on that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Nothing beyond, really, on the economy in general?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think creating jobs and small businesses would fall into that category.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Wendell.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Congress is considering another emergency funding bill for Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0The President wanted to put those things on the budget in the campaign. \xc2\xa0Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been able to?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, we have -- we would certainly like to, and it would be good if Congress could do that. \xc2\xa0It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been that way. \xc2\xa0And, Wendell, this is a newer strategy. \xc2\xa0This is -- the President has dedicated an increased number of troops and an increased number of resources that was outside the normal budget bill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the -- the plus, the addition, the tripling the number of troops in Afghanistan --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d say that as a result of the fact that the President has created a strategy that finally allows us to have the resources necessary to have success in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You realize that suggests the same explanation former President Bush gave, which was --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think President Bush ever gave the suggestion that there were enough troops -- if they gave the suggestion that there were enough troops in Afghanistan to do the job --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For Iraq. \xc2\xa0Allow me to be clear, for not putting the costs of Iraq on the budget. \xc2\xa0It was ongoing, we\xe2\x80\x99re increasing the troops, you can\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate, we have to do it -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it in emergency spending. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the same argument.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, because we\xe2\x80\x99re -- at the end of next month, we won\xe2\x80\x99t have combat troops in Iraq, so it\xe2\x80\x99s decidedly different.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you won\xe2\x80\x99t be asking for another supplemental emergency spending bill for Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m dealing with what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with now in Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t project what the next one is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Afghanistan, follow?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, in the meeting with the congressional leaders, did tax cuts, the extension of the Bush tax cuts, come up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you talk a little about that? \xc2\xa0Who brought it up and --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember who brought it up, but I think you would not be surprised at -- along the lines of where that discussion was. \xc2\xa0The President said that, as he had committed to in the campaign, he would not allow the tax cuts for the middle class to expire. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Congressman Boehner unwind his eloquent argument for preserving the tax cuts for those that are quite wealthy. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President believes -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s an economist that believes there\xe2\x80\x99s a stimulative effect to -- or a good reason in terms of economic growth to extend those tax cuts, particularly given the choice that one has to make about the budget deficit.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How much discussion was there and what was the sort of tone of it, the give and take?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I mean, it was very much -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the argument, quite frankly, is different than the one we had in -- for most of 2008, and that is the choices that one has to make on where you put your thumb -- do you put it on the side of the middle class or do you put it on the side of those that are decidedly above the middle class?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0May I follow up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0About a week and a half ago, the co-chairman of the fiscal commission came out at a jobs summit and they said basically it\xe2\x80\x99s a slim to none chance that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get 14 out of 18 votes to approve these recommendations. \xc2\xa0And given that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0To approve which recommendations?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The fiscal commission recommendations in December. \xc2\xa0And given that, and given the concern over the deficit, what possibly could you pass in terms of tax cuts after the election other than middle class or a temporary extension to everything?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, the President and his team have not argued for extending the high-end Bush tax cuts. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not an argument that people have made in this building, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not an argument that\xe2\x80\x99s -- not an argument that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be made. \xc2\xa0I think the Secretary of Treasury spoke pretty clearly to this on Sunday on both shows. \xc2\xa0And the President made a commitment not to raise taxes on the middle class and believes that those middle-class tax cuts should be preserved. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Republicans, again, lay out their case for extending high-earner income tax cuts and how they\xe2\x80\x99d like to square their statements on the budget deficit as that goes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if you have a cloud over long-term fiscal certainty in December after the election, and the big issue right now is even to decide to what extent to do tax cuts prior to the election, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that, frankly, work in your favor, not to have recommendations by the fiscal commission?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge where the fiscal commission could end up. \xc2\xa0Regardless of whether you have a fiscal commission or not, understand that, as I think you all do, that the 10-year Bush tax cuts were structured so that December -- at midnight December 31, 2010, they all expire. \xc2\xa0So regardless of the fiscal commission and its existence or not, and regardless of the ability with which its 18 votes can be structured to pass a recommendation, this is something that is going to have to be dealt with regardless of that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Did you have --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, just to wrap it up -- you said Boehner made his case. \xc2\xa0Did the President make a case for letting them lapse for the richest taxpayers beyond what you said about him reminding them that he had campaigned on this? \xc2\xa0Did he bring it into the present, make an economic argument --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0The President believes that, as, again, as you heard the Secretary of Treasury this weekend say quite clearly, that there are tax cuts that, based on our fiscal situation, simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be afforded. \xc2\xa0And we are not in favor of extending the high-earner Bush tax cuts. \xc2\xa0Those will -- we believe those should lapse.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he challenge them to address how it is that they are now arguing for stimulus when they\xe2\x80\x99ve opposed his ideas for stimulus in the past --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, there was a little discussion about -- I mean, again, I think -- again, don\xe2\x80\x99t take our word for it; I think if you look at -- I think if you were to ask any economist what the economic impact of those high-earner tax cuts are versus, for instance, the President\xe2\x80\x99s concept of Make Work Pay, which is, for 95 percent of working families, a tax cut, the stimulative effects are quite different.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, John and Mark made reference to the fundraisers tonight, tomorrow, and I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ve got more on Friday. \xc2\xa0Is this kind of the beginning of the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in terms of the fall elections and --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Oh, I realize he has been doing some, but --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You asked me if it was the beginning.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is a lot -- this is a lot all of a sudden. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s more coming up on the schedule.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s news to say we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to the election. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s also news -- as I said a minute ago, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s news that -- this is not the first or certainly the last that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Going on \xe2\x80\x9cThe View\xe2\x80\x9d to talk about Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Going on \xe2\x80\x9cThe View\xe2\x80\x9d to talk about whatever the hosts on \xe2\x80\x9cThe View\xe2\x80\x9d ask the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a regular watcher, but I am of the opinion that they\xe2\x80\x99re -- I\xe2\x80\x99m of the opinion that they have strong views and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll ask the President.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I think it is another opportunity for the President to talk to people where they are. \xc2\xa0We made a decision to put the President on Jay Leno, David Letterman, \xe2\x80\x9cThe View,\xe2\x80\x9d because that\xe2\x80\x99s where -- people have busy lives and it\xe2\x80\x99s best to go where they are. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will do tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Local reporters are talking about that in -- apparently, the event in New Jersey is in a sandwich shop, a sub shop, a famous sub shop. \xc2\xa0Is that also trying to get close to people -- grassroots?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to talk about moving a small business -- small business legislation forward so that -- look, for the better part of the last year and a half, the biggest problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had particularly with small business is ensuring that they have access to the type of capital and credit that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary not just to simply meet a payroll, but to take advantage of the beginnings of economic growth and changes in consumer demand by expanding. \xc2\xa0And having access to that credit is tremendously important.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The community bankers believe -- are certainly supportive of money to community banks that can be lent directly to small businesses.Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, you said a minute ago that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe we can afford to extend the tax cuts for the high-income. \xc2\xa0Does he think the country can afford to extend the tax cuts for everybody else?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I believe the President believes that raising taxes on the middle class during this economic time would not make a lot of economic sense. \xc2\xa0And I think if you go back to the campaign, the President made that pledge not simply to make that pledge, but to make that pledge because for years and years and years we\xe2\x80\x99d watched jobs being shed, wages either flat or declining, and that now is neither the time nor the place to raise taxes on them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he thinks, given the fiscal situation, the country can afford to extend those tax cuts?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, and -- as at the same time, we begin to look at our medium- and long-term fiscal threats. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, can you comment on the report by the Inspector General for the reconstruction of Iraq that billions of dollars have been missing and there\xe2\x80\x99s a very poor system of oversight and liability? \xc2\xa0And also, can you tell us what does it mean for you, since you\xe2\x80\x99re shifting from the military focus to reconstruction and building Iraq?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, and I would -- this is a report that covers the time period of 2003 to -- as I understand it, 2003 to 2004. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d point you over to some in the Department of Defense that have worked on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I will say this. \xc2\xa0This is why the President has pledged greater accountability. \xc2\xa0This is why the President has undertaken contract reform and why we can\xe2\x80\x99t have -- why we can\xe2\x80\x99t have, as he said, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, blank checks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, you touched earlier on polling as it relates to Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0But broadening that a bit, the President\xe2\x80\x99s numbers have slid recently among several key groups from Hispanics, to whites, to men, independents. \xc2\xa0Does that matter? \xc2\xa0Does that make it tougher to get his agenda through Congress?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I was asked specifically about the impact of public opinion on the war. \xc2\xa0Look, the President has made a series of decisions -- whether they were politically popular or not, the President believed they were the right decisions to make.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Take for instance, the President will make two stops on Friday, in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan, to visit the Chrysler and G.M. plants in each of those -- in those two places. \xc2\xa0Ensuring that the auto industry -- Chrysler and G.M., in particular -- did not go bankrupt, the President asked them to make a series of tough decisions about restructuring in order to qualify for aid to get them through that bankruptcy period. \xc2\xa0Not an altogether popular decision, but understanding that the ramifications of not doing that would have been probably a million jobs lost, a supply chain that disappeared, and if you look at where the auto industry is today, 55,000 more people are employed by the auto industry today than when the President took office.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 It was a tough decision to make. \xc2\xa0The President asked for sacrifices by those companies in making some hard decisions that for years they had put off in terms of restructuring in order to build a better future for its workers and the communities that those plants were in. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s in many ways a metaphor for the decisions that the President has made on the economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I also -- I go back to the notion that we are in a time of two wars and 9.5 percent unemployment and it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that people are frustrated.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you pursue any legal action against WikiLeaks?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0There is an ongoing investigation that is looking into the leaking of classified information. \xc2\xa0As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here before, my transmitting one of those documents to you would constitute a violation of federal law, and certainly, as I said earlier, handling that type of information comes with certain responsibilities. \xc2\xa0And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t meet those responsibilities, you\xe2\x80\x99re held liable.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 George.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who were the members who met with the President at lunch today? \xc2\xa0And what was the topic?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a list. \xc2\xa0There was no specific topic. \xc2\xa0It was a series of -- like the President has had, a series of lunches with both senators and members of the House. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- right as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99m done here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a list.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We never got that list last week, though. \xc2\xa0I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s twice in a week the President is meeting with members -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who they are.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We put the list out. \xc2\xa0But I will -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get both lists to you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Glenn.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked from time to time about the potential risks faced by U.S. service members because of this disclosure. \xc2\xa0Do you think that this is bad enough to warrant -- whomever passes information along, presumably, you will find out who it is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s anyone who is currently in custody -- do you think this warrants a jail sentence for the person --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- besides not being a classification expert, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a sentencing -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a judge familiar with sentencing guidelines or an attorney. \xc2\xa0I presume that if this person or persons is identified, that they will prosecuted and, as I said earlier, you make a commitment when handling this type of information to live up to the responsibilities invested in federal law in how one handles this information. \xc2\xa0And if you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to live up to those responsibilities, then you face those consequences.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Tom.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0I have two quick questions. \xc2\xa0First, Tony Hayward, in his exit interview with the British press, he was asked if his ouster was fair, he said life\xe2\x80\x99s not fair, and he said that he was forced to leave because he\xe2\x80\x99d been demonized by the American press. \xc2\xa0And he also said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- he thought he might be too busy to attend future hearings about the oil spill. \xc2\xa0Do you have any reaction to those comments?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, what\xe2\x80\x99s not fair is what\xe2\x80\x99s happened on the Gulf. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s not fair is that the actions of some have caused the greatest environmental disaster that our country has ever seen. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s also not living up to your obligations is -- and your responsibilities are -- if Congress seeks to talk to him about the actions that he and his company undertook as part of the -- what led up to, what caused, or the response to that spill, our belief is that Mr. Hayward should make himself available for that. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I will say this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that a lot of people in any country are feeling overly sorry for the former CEO of BP. \xc2\xa0I think the decision -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak to the decision that the board made. \xc2\xa0I can only speak to the damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been caused and the lives that have been altered because of it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My second question -- do you have any reaction to the news that Andrew Breitbart will be appearing at a fundraiser with RNC Chairman Michael Steele?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction and I\xe2\x80\x99m altogether not surprised.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Third, I wanted to just clarify something from the Lockerbie letter. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a part in there where it says that -- well, obviously you explained that the first preference was that he remain locked up, but if they were going to let him go that it be to house arrest in Scotland. \xc2\xa0And in the letter it references that this would be the best thing for the families. \xc2\xa0And I just wanted to see if you could clarify, was that done after conferring with the families? \xc2\xa0Was that a --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the comment -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what had been undertaken with the families prior to that. \xc2\xa0Let me make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re clear on the point. \xc2\xa0As is stated I think at least twice in the letter, the preference, strongly, as communicated both in the letter, by the President and by members of this administration to the government was that this individual continue to serve the sentence -- his sentence where he was. \xc2\xa0If they made the unfortunate decision to do something differently, we did not want -- we wanted at all costs to avoid the pain that would obviously be caused by a celebration or some sort of welcome befitting a hero, not a terrorist and a murderer, in Libya. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 None of that was listened to. \xc2\xa0And I think the pictures -- the disgusting pictures that we saw in many ways speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was that done in conference with the families? \xc2\xa0Or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, but I will check.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, the President is going to New Jersey tomorrow, I believe, and probably will be seeing Senator Menendez. \xc2\xa0It seems that a number of individuals from not only Great Britain but from Scotland as well have refused to testify or meet with his committee on Thursday. \xc2\xa0Are there any thoughts here about that? \xc2\xa0And would the President --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who has been called and who\xe2\x80\x99s decided not to come. \xc2\xa0I know that Prime Minister Cameron, when he was here, talked about the cooperation that they would lend into looking into the developments around the Lockerbie release.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was a number of high-levels, including the First Minister, I believe.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty clear where we were on this, the notion that somebody like this should be -- continue to be locked up and serving their jail time, and believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that anybody cooperate with the investigation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 END \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa02:58 P.M.
