Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:39 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Two quick announcements at the top before we go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re both scheduling announcements, actually.\xc2\xa0 The first is, at 3:00 p.m. today the President will host a swearing-in ceremony for the new director of the United States Secret Service, Julia Pierson.\xc2\xa0 That will be in the Oval Office, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged for a pool to be there to witness it.\xc2\xa0 So that should be pretty good.</p>\n<p>The second thing is about tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the President will hold an event here at the White House where he will stand with mothers who want Congress to take action on common-sense measures to protect children from gun violence.\xc2\xa0 The event will take place in the East Room.\xc2\xa0 And in addition to the mothers on stage with the President, there will be law enforcement officials, victims of gun violence, and other stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 So that will be tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact time, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that on the guidance tonight.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, here in the East Room in the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, Julie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get us started.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple things on DOMA.\xc2\xa0 Did the President get any update from the Solicitor General following the oral arguments today?\xc2\xa0 And was there anyone from the White House who was there to witness the arguments, like yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that the President has been kept apprised of the arguments made at the Supreme Court on these issues, both through reading the coverage of you and your colleagues but also based on briefings that he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten from his legal staff here at the White House.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also my understanding that the White House officials who attended yesterday are the White House officials also attended today.\xc2\xa0 So that was Valerie Jarrett, Kathy Ruemmler, the Counsel of the White House, and Kathleen Hartnett, who\xe2\x80\x99s an associate counsel here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There seemed to be, in sort of the initial reading of the justices\xe2\x80\x99 questions, a sense that they were also questioning the constitutionality of DOMA.\xc2\xa0 Did the President, in the short period of time that\xe2\x80\x99s passed since it was wrapped up, have any reaction to the proceedings today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from him about his reaction to the proceedings today.\xc2\xa0 I know that going into the proceedings that he had full confidence in his team at the Justice Department and others who were responsible for preparing the arguments, and had total confidence in the people who were prepared to walk in there and deliver them.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of his reaction for how it played out, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a little bit more from the President, at least publicly this week, on immigration reform -- the interviews today, the event on Monday.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason why he feels like he needs to be kind of more forthright publicly this week as Congress works its way towards a possible deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The reason that the President felt like it was important for him to be very public this week, as he has been in previous weeks about immigration reform, is that it remains a top priority of his.\xc2\xa0 This is something that he talked about quite extensively during the campaign; and something since the beginning of this year, when he laid out his principles in a speech in Las Vegas in January, has made clear that this is an important priority, both in terms of the impact that -- reforming in a comprehensive way our broken immigration system because of the impact that it would have on our economy, but also because it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we need to make sure that everybody is playing by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by reforming our broken immigration system in a comprehensive way, we can accomplish those two goals.</p>\n<p>So the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to speak with Univision and Telemundo correspondents this afternoon to talk about why that\xe2\x80\x99s such a priority for him.\xc2\xa0 And I think what he\xe2\x80\x99ll also note, though, to be fair, is the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made by the bipartisan group of eight senators who are working on this in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the sticking points right now is this wages for guest workers.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, business and labor are split on this.\xc2\xa0 Has the President done any outreach to labor, to Trumka at AFL-CIO on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the White House staff, throughout this process of negotiations -- bipartisan negotiations have been ongoing -- has been engaged.\xc2\xa0 And they have been engaged both to offer some technical assistance, but also to ensure, or at least to represent the administration point of view, to try to steer the proposal in the direction of the principles that the President had laid out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the progress that the groups are making in terms of trying to hammer out an agreement here.\xc2\xa0 And we are also heartened by the fact that Senator Schumer at least has said that he expects that a bill will be filed shortly after the Easter vacation.\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly pleased with the progress and looking forward to taking a look at what they have agreed upon.</p>\n<p>Hey, Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step in trying to reach a grand bargain with Republicans over the deficit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Steve, for some time now, the chief impediment to reaching a grand bargain has been the refusal of Republicans to ask the wealthiest and well-connected to pay even a dime more to help us deal with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sad to report that even months later that that continues to be the case, that we are seeing a group of Republicans in the Congress who are refusing to compromise on this.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you even see some of them that are actually running around the country bragging about their intransigence on this.</p>\n<p>That\'s not in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of our economy.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward his own plan, a genuine compromise that reflects the balanced approach that the President supports.\xc2\xa0 It would reduce our deficits based on the agreements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached over the last 18 months or so.\xc2\xa0 It would reduce our deficits by about $4 trillion, $4.5 trillion over 10 years, and it would reach that deficit reduction by making smart cuts in government spending, by eliciting some savings from reforms to our entitlement programs, and by asking the wealthy and well-connected to pay a little bit more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happens now then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are in a place now where it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for us to reach an agreement when you have a firm block of Republican senators who are refusing to compromise.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s even more disappointing where -- it\xe2\x80\x99s even more disappointing that the natural compromise that should exist in terms of additional cuts in government spending, some reforms to entitlement programs, both of those -- those are two items that Republicans have long said that they have sought, and asking the wealthiest and well-connected to pay a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 By pursuing that balanced approach, we can reach some significant deficit reduction in a way that\'s good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 But as long as Republicans are saying we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to ask the wealthiest and well-connected to pay a single dime to reduce our deficit, then it is hard to imagine that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach a compromise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So basically the process has stalemated then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the process is currently being blocked by Republicans who refuse to consider -- even consider asking the wealthiest and well-connected to pay more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So any more meetings planned or any talks about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I have to read out to you right now.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- since December -- has had on the table an updated compromise plan, one that he originally presented to Speaker Boehner in mid-December.\xc2\xa0 The details of that offer are posted on the White House website.\xc2\xa0 They remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 So if there happens to be a critical mass of Republicans in Congress who take a look at that proposal and say, you know what, we actually would like to reach an agreement that would do something significant about our deficit; that would make some strategic cuts to government programs where we can; that would reform entitlements in a way that would protect those programs for the future, but also enjoy some savings that we could pay toward reducing the deficit; and ask the wealthy and well-connected to pay a little bit more, then that would be the outline of compromise.\xc2\xa0 What we need to see is we need to see Republicans who are willing to demonstrate some political courage to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly on another subject.\xc2\xa0 North Dakota is signing a law banning most abortions.\xc2\xa0 Is this something you\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at on whether it is constitutional?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a state matter, and so I don\'t have a specific comment on it.\xc2\xa0 I know that the expectation is -- just from reading the reports, I know the expectation is that there are a number of legal challenges that are likely to be pursued.\xc2\xa0 And I know that many people who know a whole lot more about the law than I do are skeptical that these types of laws will stand up to legal scrutiny like that, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not a decision for us to make.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s view on this is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 He certainly is opposed to measures like that.\xc2\xa0 He believes in protecting a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of if there is a legal process forthcoming, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that will be -- that will wind its way through the process and not something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- at least initially -- be involved in.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on immigration, if we could.\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain in his home state said yesterday that he -- he told some of his constituents that, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we can achieve agreement or not.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working hard\xe2\x80\xa6but I can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee anything.\xe2\x80\x9d Is the White House concerned?\xc2\xa0 And is in fact this push that happened on Monday and then, again, the interviews today, are those linked in any way in a concern that this is stalled at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, in fact, we\xe2\x80\x99re actually encouraged by the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made by the bipartisan group of senators who have been working on this for a number of months now.\xc2\xa0 Senator Schumer said just on Sunday that he was optimistic that they\xe2\x80\x99d be able to file a piece of legislation when they got back from the Easter recess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that Senator McCain and his Arizona colleague, Senator Flake, are hosting a couple of their Democratic colleagues -- Senator Bennet and Senator Schumer -- in Arizona today, again, to take a look at the border, to take a look at the important investments and commitments that have been made by this administration to securing the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we are hopeful that, as they work their way through this process, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bipartisan agreement that reflects many of the principles that the President himself has laid out.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll reserve judgment on the product of those discussions until it\xe2\x80\x99s produced, but at this time we are -- we remain encouraged by the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99re making.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s statement by Senator Schumer would trump yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s statement by Senator McCain that he, in fact, can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee they will have a bill and that he is, in fact -- couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee anything and he is discouraged?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the exact comments from Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 I would -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make any guarantees about what happens in Congress two weeks from now, I would actually suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s quite -- he\xe2\x80\x99s being pretty judicious, because I think it is difficult to predict what exactly happens in Congress.</p>\n<p>But I think that the vast majority of indications are that this bipartisan group has made a lot of progress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s progress that the White House has been involved in, as I mentioned earlier.\xc2\xa0 The White House has offered some technical assistance to them as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working through drafts of legislation and I know that there are others who are involved in those talks who are interested in ensuring or at least trying to steer that group in the direction of the principles that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 And by all indications, they\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not up here offering any guarantees either.\xc2\xa0 But what I am encouraged by and what the White House is encouraged by are the indications that they\xe2\x80\x99re making some progress and will be prepared in a couple of weeks to file a piece of legislation or around the deadline that they set for themselves a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, finally, just to be clear here, so the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed his mind about stepping back, letting Congress work this out, and not inserting himself as he did on Monday and as he is a little bit today with the Spanish-language media?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not reasserting himself into the process at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys sort of evaluate whether or not the President is asserting himself or inserting himself into the process.\xc2\xa0 The President has beliefs.\xc2\xa0 The President campaigned on and won reelection on a platform of pursuing comprehensive immigration reform early in his second term.\xc2\xa0 That is a promise that the President has followed through on.\xc2\xa0 The reason -- one of the important reasons that immigration reform is such a legislative priority for both sides is because of the public support that the President has marshaled on this issue.</p>\n<p>So it is natural that the President would be involved in the process of putting together a policy that would finally fix our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, we have allowed a bipartisan group of senators, at their request, to take the lead in the conversations about a bipartisan compromise in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 Those are conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been involved with from the beginning, but we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that we see this group of eight senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- working together to try to put in place a policy that could pass through the Senate with bipartisan support, could pass through the House with bipartisan support, and would be the kind of legislation that the President could sign.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that the system is supposed to work.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to talk to you about North Korea for a minute.\xc2\xa0 And I took seriously what Jay said about the statement.\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is if there is any conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s reached the President, or if he\xe2\x80\x99s aligned or put together working groups that view what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in North Korea in the last three or four weeks as materially different the kind of rhetoric and provocations and actions that this government has seen before.\xc2\xa0 Because there are a number of people who are familiar with this issue who do feel increasingly that there is a material difference and that the risks are greater, and that there is something afoot here that is different and possibly more threatening to South Korea and U.S. interests throughout the region than we have seen before.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you if you can tell us anything about whether the administration believes that\xe2\x80\x99s true, if it feels it is materially different, and is doing anything in response to that conclusion.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the thing that we have -- it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to offer you a specific assessment from here.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the White House and this administration, and certainly through the Department of Defense and other agencies and leaders in this government who are responsible for the safety and security of not just the United States of America but also our allies, have been engaged with our international partners to try to deal with this challenge.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from North Koreans is more bellicose rhetoric and threats that only follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others.\xc2\xa0 The North Koreans are not going to achieve anything through these threats and provocations, and they\xe2\x80\x99re only going to further isolate the North Koreans and undermine international efforts to bring peace and stability to Northeast Asia.</p>\n<p>We remain committed to ensuring that the security of the South Koreans, our allies, are protected, and we have the capability that we need to ensure that the United States and our assets are protected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Secretary was over in China, had -- was the first civilian leader to see the new Chinese President.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he has a very good relationship with the President.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there were any conversations or any reports back to the President from the Treasury Secretary, because I have to believe in these conversations North Korea did come up as a general topic.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the details of the discussions between Secretary Lew and President Xi, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us if there is any different posturing here in the building, on a daily basis or even a weekly basis, about North Korea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by posturing?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meetings, briefings to the President?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99d say no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is anything being lifted up to a higher level of<br/>\n\tscrutiny, analysis and presentation of that analysis to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that this is something that is being --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a higher level of urgency or curiosity or interest now than there was, say, two months ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s always been a pretty vigilant posture when it comes to North Korea, in terms of monitoring their statements, in terms of monitoring their capabilities, and making sure that we have the resources that we need to protect our interests and our allies.\xc2\xa0 We remain engaged with our international partners in the region who also have a stake in resolving this peacefully.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to compare that to previous instances like this, but I can tell you that this is something that we have been vigilant about for quite some time now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not more so now than throughout the entire administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say at least as vigilant as we have been previously.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask all of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s questions over again -- (laughter) -- but just to insert gun control instead of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Will you guarantee that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a big gun control bill that will pass through both chambers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to try to stand here and predict the future about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in the Congress, but I can tell you that, in the same way that we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made in bipartisan fashion on immigration reform, we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the bipartisan progress that\'s been made in the Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are a number of measures that passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee, last week I believe it was, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with the Senate and with members in both parties, frankly, who are interested in working with the President to put in place measures that would reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 As the President himself has said pretty articulately that this is a complex problem, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the complicated nature of it prevent us from taking action.\xc2\xa0 And there are some meaningful, common-sense things that we can do to reduce gun violence in our communities at the same time respecting the rights provided by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today I believe is 100 days since the tragedy at Sandy Hook, and obviously the President -- that may be one reason why he\xe2\x80\x99s having this event here at the White House tomorrow, obviously to mark that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a national day of action tomorrow, as well on this.\xc2\xa0 But a lot of time -- 100 days has passed since the tragedy.\xc2\xa0 The nation\xe2\x80\x99s attention was focused.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the fiscal cliff and other things have come up.\xc2\xa0 Is he getting more active now, worried that perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s lost some momentum on this important issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would slightly disagree with the premise of your question because I think that the President has been engaged on this pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 And I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how many events has he had here at the White House on this in this room, pushing with moms or --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 There have been more than 20 events actually, more than 20 events and interviews and public appearances, between the President and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s activities, spread out over 100 days.\xc2\xa0 That\'s more than one a week.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President has been engaged on from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Putting somebody like the Vice President in charge of this is significant.\xc2\xa0 This is somebody that has a long history with these issues from being the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and intimately involved in the passage of the first crime bill that included an assault weapons ban.</p>\n<p>But two days after the tragedy in Newtown, the President spoke pretty eloquently about steps that Congress should take.\xc2\xa0 Three days later, he stood at this podium in this room where he appointed -- or he asked the Vice President to take the lead here, at least initially, in coming up with some ideas.\xc2\xa0 But even in those remarks, he talked about and challenged Congress to pass legislation on banning military-style assault weapons, banning high-capacity magazines, and closing loopholes in the background checks.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that the President said and called on Congress to act on, on December 19th.\xc2\xa0 And since that time, the President has spoken repeatedly about this from weekly addresses.\xc2\xa0 The President had a very eloquent challenge in the State of the Union, where he asked Congress to vote on specific measures that would actually have a tangible impact on reducing gun violence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done all that, and yet his own Senate Majority Leader, fellow Democrat Harry Reid, would not include the assault weapons ban in the package of reforms that\'s coming up.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a separate vote on it as an amendment.\xc2\xa0 But despite all of that talk, all of the speeches, all of the meetings, even the Senate Majority Leader is not guaranteeing that they\'re going to get an assault --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think because of all the talk of the President and because of his aggressive advocacy of this issue, there will be a vote in the United States Senate on whether or not military-style assault weapons will be banned from the streets of this country.\xc2\xa0 I think there is -- that represents progress.</p>\n<p>Now, does it mean -- I can\'t stand here and guarantee that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass, but it is a question that 100 senators are going to ask themselves when they wake up in the morning and look themselves in the mirror about whether or not they are going to -- about which side they\'re going to be on when it comes to voting on a ban on military-style assault weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the President will certainly continue to advocate for senators to support that ban.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can, I want to ask you a question about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at 3:00 p.m. today.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be there with Julia Pierson for the U.S. Secret Service Director.\xc2\xa0 First of all, was she the President\xe2\x80\x99s first choice to be Secret Service Director?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that she\xe2\x80\x99s the right person for the job, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean she was the first choice?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that -- to the process here.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that there is even more than one candidate.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Ms. Pierson, as you know, is a 30-year veteran of the United States Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who has held a variety of leadership roles at the Secret Service from some protective activities to cybercrime, and most recently as the chief of staff of the organization.\xc2\xa0 So this is somebody that has a strong record of leadership at the organization.\xc2\xa0 And she embodies the kind of character and leadership that the President would like to see at the top of that organization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that organization faces unique challenges right now.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post reported some information that I just want to get your thoughts on.\xc2\xa0 They spoke to a series of agents that were interviewed in the last couple of weeks that said that Pierson was a \xe2\x80\x9cweak candidate about rank-and-file agents because she has spent relatively little time supervising or working high-priority protective details, spending most of her career in administrative jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern for the President to have somebody who has more time in the field than behind the desk?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President believes that Julia Pierson has exactly the kind of experience that we want the person who\xe2\x80\x99s going to lead that agency to have.\xc2\xa0 I guess the other thing I would point you to is that I know that the outgoing director, Mark Sullivan, who I know has a lot of respect across the agency, is somebody who has strongly supported her for candidacy and said that she was exactly the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the President who believes that she\xe2\x80\x99s the right person for the job, it\xe2\x80\x99s the outgoing Director of the Secret Service who believes that she has exactly the experience and skills necessary to lead that agency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This one -- given the fact that the White House came under a lot of scrutiny in recent weeks or months about what the Cabinet looked like and what some of the top leaders of this top administration looked like and that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough women at the time, now we can say that the head of the DEA, the head of the U.S. Marshals Office and now the head of the Secret Service will all be women.\xc2\xa0 Does this represent something significant that America should be taking note of -- that the administration would want to declare with yet another female head?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I would say is that Ms. Pierson got the job because of her 30 years of experience and because the leadership skills that she\xe2\x80\x99s shown throughout her career at the United States Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 The fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s the first woman to lead this agency is notable and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the reason she was chosen for the job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>She\xe2\x80\x99s chosen for the job because she is the right person at the right time to lead this agency that has a critical law enforcement function -- not just in terms of protecting the President and his family, but also in terms of safeguarding the financial system and other large public events that come under the jurisdiction of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s got a big job but she\xe2\x80\x99s the right person to get it done right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then digressing on one other topic and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tee it up for the next person if they like, but why if the spending cuts are locked into place with the CR, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President just veto the CR?\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this something worth fighting for to continue his effort?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President does believe that eliminating the sequester is something that\xe2\x80\x99s worth fighting for.\xc2\xa0 The President said that this was bad policy from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Republicans said it was bad policy from the beginning, at least many of them did.\xc2\xa0 After it passed, though, we unfortunately saw a lot of tea party Republicans say that this was a political victory.\xc2\xa0 I know another one of them called it a homerun.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.</p>\n<p>What the President also believes, though, is we can\xe2\x80\x99t have a situation where Washington careens from one fiscal crisis to another.\xc2\xa0 That is -- that has a terrible impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen that our economy is starting to actually get some traction in the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to make some progress -- whether you look at jobs numbers or consumer confidence, even housing data recently came out to indicate that home values are -- have increased as much as they have in any time in the last eight years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made in terms of our economic recovery, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t careen from one fiscal crisis to another because that\xe2\x80\x99s only going to block that progress.\xc2\xa0 What we actually need is we need comprehensive compromise, economic policymaking in this town that actually supports that recovery instead of inhibit it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A report by the Society of Actuaries says that insurers will have to pay on average 32 percent more for claims on insurance policies, individual insurance policies that they purchase because of Obamacare, and that that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be passed on to consumers.\xc2\xa0 It says that there will be a dip some places, but some states are going to see really big increases, like 62 percent in California, 80 percent in Ohio and Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about those numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you are citing a study that I believe was conducted by a health insurance company that\xe2\x80\x99s critical of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So that part I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly surprised about.\xc2\xa0 The reason that the Affordable Care Act was put in place was to ensure that we were expanding access to health care for every American, but also because we wanted to actually protect consumers who are repeatedly victimized by insurance companies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly surprising to me that an insurance company would conduct a study that was critical of a piece of legislation that was promising to hold them accountable for their actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you talk about some of the numbers -- I know that there is some contention with the way that they -- sort of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve factored in and what they haven\xe2\x80\x99t factored in.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that -- you should check with the Department of Health and Human Services who may have some more detailed information on this.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some assumptions on there that are spurious at best.\xc2\xa0 But there are a number of things about the Affordable Care Act that at this point are inarguable at this point, if you will.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act has already saved consumers an estimated $2.1 billion on their health insurance premiums that probably otherwise were it not for the Affordable Care Act would be an additional $2 billion that were paid into the pockets of insurance companies, like that one that funded this study.</p>\n<p>Once the law takes full effect, it will have the benefit of increasing competition, driving down cost, and result in average premiums that are lower today -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that will be lower in the future than they are today for the same benefits that are being provided.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an analysis that\xe2\x80\x99s conducted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about some comments yesterday, made reportedly by your Health and Human Services Secretary, saying that that there will be an increase in premium cost for some Americans as a result of Obamacare?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those comments.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what I did see yesterday was actually a blog post from the Chairman of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisors, who said that each year, from 2009 to 2011, the national health expenditure data shows the real rate of annual growth in overall health spending was between 3 and 3.1 percent, which is actually the lowest rate of growth since reporting began in 1960.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be increases for some people who are purchasing insurance?\xc2\xa0 Do you concede that?\xc2\xa0 Kathleen Sebelius reportedly has.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would actually point you to is I would actually point to the results that we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing from the Affordable Care Act, which is a savings of $2.1 billion, and the analysis from the CBO that actually says in the future we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see rates that are lower for higher benefits.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is she wrong?\xc2\xa0 Because she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about people paying more for higher benefits.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her comment.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her comments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the guest worker program, does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for it to be in there to have a viable, comprehensive immigration reform bill that can get bipartisan support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that a variety of parties who have interests in this are working on.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s included in line with the other principles that the President has rolled out -- laid out in terms of what should be included in comprehensive immigration reform, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we could support.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reserve judgment on what that looks like until it\xe2\x80\x99s actually produced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s more important?\xc2\xa0 Coming to an agreement, or bringing labor along and making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re included?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President wants to see is he wants to see a bipartisan agreement in line with the principles that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity for us to fix our broken immigration system in a way that will strengthen our economy and ensure that everybody is playing by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 That is the priority, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is looking for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is the labor sign-on?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a place right now where we want a piece -- see a piece of legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of the economy and that reflects our nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage, as a nation of immigrants but also a nation of laws.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly want to build as much support for that as we possibly can, both from Democrats and Republicans as well as from outside organizations that traditionally support Democrats and outside organizations that traditionally support Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the arguments over DOMA, the justices seemed to have a lot of questions about why the President has decided to continue enforcing a law that he thinks is unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 The Chief Justice said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the courage of his convictions and not enforce the law if he thinks it is unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you explain that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a responsibility that the administration has to enforce the laws that are on the books, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that even for laws that we disagree with, including the Defense of Marriage Act.\xc2\xa0 The argument that we have made before the Supreme Court and the argument that we have made publicly, including in a letter that the Attorney General sent to the Speaker of the House a couple years ago, is the argument that Section 3 -- let me make sure I got that right -- Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 That is a position, broadly speaking, that a lot of Republicans agree with.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not unprecedented for an administration to take that position.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the position that\xe2\x80\x99s being argued before the Supreme Court today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a position that has a lot of support from people in both parties.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the outcome looks like from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But President Obama has endorsed signing statements; he\xe2\x80\x99s issued signing statements saying, I believe this law or this part of the law to be unconstitutional so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to enforce it.\xc2\xa0 So as you say we will enforce laws that we believe to be unconstitutional, he\xe2\x80\x99s also said he won\xe2\x80\x99t enforce some laws that he believes to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the signing statements have said.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of what our legal posture is for these things, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 They have done the legal analysis required to reach the conclusion that it is unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 They also are the ones that are responsible for enforcing these laws.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge what the Department of Justice may have to say about this, based on their own analysis.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that the argument that the administration has put forward before the Supreme Court today is an indication that our lawyers have concluded that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Yes, Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Fiscal \xe2\x80\x9914 budget, do you guys have a date yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What day of the week is this?\xc2\xa0 Is it Wednesday?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll see at least --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay said you would tell.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll get this question at least two more times before the end of the week.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date to allow you to mark anything on your calendar just yet, Roger, beyond the week of April 8th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you will give us a date eventually?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Eventually, we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have to, unless we could spread out the budget rollout over the course of five full days, which I think everybody in here would be disappointed about except Roger.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it taking so long to set a date?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t set a date.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So tell it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I just said I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell you what date it is.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the week of April 8th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that about?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99ll be the week of April 8th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the big secret?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a planning process and we\xe2\x80\x99re working through it.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99ll be April 8th.\xc2\xa0 The week of April 8th.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, Josh.\xc2\xa0 When the President does send up the Fiscal \xe2\x80\x9914 budget --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the week of April 8th.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the week of April 8th, sometime next month --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sometime next month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the Pentagon is going to be asking for $8.4 billion to continue development and purchase of the F-35 fighter.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a project that\xe2\x80\x99s seven years behind schedule and 70 percent over its initial cost estimates.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that project?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- because the budget is going to be rolled out in just a couple of weeks, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what may or may not be included in the budget.\xc2\xa0 So those are the kinds of questions that are perfectly legitimate, and one that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to answer after the budget has been rolled out.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a detailed answer for you at that point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has supported it in the past, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have previous years\xe2\x80\x99 budgets in front of me, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to compare them to previous ones.\xc2\xa0 But we can certainly have OMB take a look at that for you.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of level of concern is there or engagement in the White House right now about the situation in Guantanamo Bay?\xc2\xa0 The military says 31 inmates are on hunger strike.\xc2\xa0 Defense lawyers say that number is higher.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about this?\xc2\xa0 Is there any dialogue with the military about this in the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Stephen, I can tell you that the White House and the President\xe2\x80\x99s team is closely monitoring the hunger strikers at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 For details about what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening there, I would refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the administration remains committed to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Progress has been made under this and the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 But given the legislation that progress has put in place it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time to fully close the facility.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from news reports is that there are representatives from the Red Cross that will be visiting the facility sometime this week -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s today or tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 That is part of a routine agreement that we have with the Red Cross, where we give them full access so that they can take a look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the prison there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense that somewhat -- the situation there is the result of the fact that Congress has stopped funding to transfer people who have already been cleared for release?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to judge about what these individuals may or may not be thinking or what may be motivating their actions there.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 They may have a better assessment there than I do.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, two questions.\xc2\xa0 The Pierson appointment -- what does that do for the Service right now, especially after the Colombian prostitute scandal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the first woman to be appointed --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you for agreeing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the first woman to be appointed.\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, there was a prostitute scandal with women, with men, and with prostitutes that are women in Colombia.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, you asked me, so I\xe2\x80\x99m breaking it down very basic for you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I appreciate that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- so you can help me get me an answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, what I can tell you is that Director Sullivan, in the immediate aftermath of the events that you so colorfully described --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You asked for it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- took immediate steps to ensure that the safety of the President had not been affected.\xc2\xa0 The allegations of misconduct were investigated, and swift action was taken against those Secret Service personnel who had engaged in that misconduct.</p>\n<p>And I know that there were several members of the Secret Service who, as a result of this misconduct, either left the Secret Service or lost their job.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that there were -- that Director Sullivan, in the immediate aftermath of this event, took swift action both in terms of investigating what had happened, ensuring that the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety was never jeopardized, and ensuring that new protocols were put in place to reduce the likelihood that something like this would ever happen again.</p>\n<p>Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s also relevant, it seems to me, that the new director has some leadership experience at the agency.\xc2\xa0 She also has some experience in human resources and training, and would be able to, as she leads the agency, to ensure that the protocols that Director Sullivan has put in place are continued and, if necessary, strengthened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you trying to send a message with this appointment of a female who has strong leadership in the light of all of this and other allegations?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was pretty direct in the paper statement that we distributed from him yesterday about why she was chosen for the job.\xc2\xa0 And certainly her leadership skills and her character and her 30 years of experience at the United States Secret Service are the reasons why she was chosen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask you another question.\xc2\xa0 I hope you have it on paper as well.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the President meets with African leaders.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us a readout as to why this meeting -- why now?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking a very good question but I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to answer it right now.\xc2\xa0 But if you want to touch base later this afternoon, maybe you and I can record an interview or we can make sure that your listeners are aware just what the President is up to tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would love to, thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, sounds good.</p>\n<p>Zach.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A question related to the Affordable Care Act, which you mentioned earlier.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the reduction in health spending, you mentioned earlier, is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that that\xe2\x80\x99s the result of the Affordable Care Act or the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies?\xc2\xa0 And then, a second question is, the administration requested more funding for ACA implementation, and the CR didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it, of course.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that the program is underfunded and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to make it difficult to roll out in full form in about seven months?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the impact that the Affordable Care Act has had on health care costs, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d actually refer you to the Congressional Budget Office, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually noted that based on their nonpartisan independent analysis, that once the Affordable Care Act takes effect it will increase competition, drive down costs, and result in average premiums being lower than they are today for the exact same benefits.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is a pretty clear assessment from a nonpartisan group as opposed to a study that was funded by the health insurance industry -- but a pretty clear assessment from a nonpartisan group about what impact the Affordable Care Act is going to have on the budgets of families all across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify -- the slowdown you said earlier from the White House post, that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- is that the result of the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think earlier you said there had been a slowdown in health spending since 2009-2011, in response to Brianna\xe2\x80\x99s question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering, are you saying that\xe2\x80\x99s the result of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a separate issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this was an analysis that was conducted by the CEA, so we can maybe get you some more details on that analysis if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that it is probably not a coincidence that after the Affordable Care Act was passed, that we have seen growth rates slow to the lowest levels on record.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the second question was, is the ACA underfunded, and is that going to make more difficult the implementation of the program?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not -- I have not been told.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate at all any delay in the successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There are some deadlines coming up later this year, and the expectation is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have these marketplaces set up and ready to roll and begin covering people by January 1st.\xc2\xa0 So there are some important deadlines to be met, and I have no reason to believe that those deadlines won\xe2\x80\x99t be met.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on the TennCare decision?\xc2\xa0 The Governor in Tennessee has decided that rather than actually expanding Medicare, as is allowed under the Affordable Care Act, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take the money and use it to help people purchase insurance on their own.\xc2\xa0 However, in order to do that, he obviously needs permission from the administration, which he doesn\'t have yet.\xc2\xa0 Have you folks taken a look at that?\xc2\xa0 Are you leaning towards that or against?\xc2\xa0 Or anything you can --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw that news right before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for working with states as they implement the Affordable Care Act, so I\xe2\x80\x99d direct your question to Health and Human Services and they may be able to give you a clearer sense of whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find a workable solution with the state of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly on the budget -- I just got an email here from the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 It says it\xe2\x80\x99s 12 days until you release your budget.\xc2\xa0 Did you tell them when you\xe2\x80\x99re releasing the budget?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe we have a mole.\xc2\xa0 No, we have not told them when we\xe2\x80\x99re going to release the budget.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve been paying attention to the briefings and know that it\xe2\x80\x99s the week of April 8th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to immigration for a second.\xc2\xa0 You brought up Senator McCain and Senator Flake\xe2\x80\x99s and Bennet\xe2\x80\x99s and Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the border.\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify -- your impression is that what they\'re trying to do there is to showcase the achievements of the Obama administration on border security?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what they\'re planning to showcase.\xc2\xa0 What I was actually observing is what I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll see when they get to the border.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99ll see is the results of the significant investment and commitment that this administration has made to securing the border.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- there are 22,000 personnel on the border.\xc2\xa0 There are -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to look for -- these are some good statistics about what they might see while they\'re there.</p>\n<p>There are some unprecedented investments in technology and infrastructure that have resulted in the construction of 651 miles of fencing; the deployment of mobile surveillance units, of thermal imaging systems; and more than 125 aircraft, including six unmanned aircraft systems, patrolling the Southwest border.\xc2\xa0 And this is all part of why the border is now more secure than it ever has been.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any information about who from the administration is helping guide them through the Arizona border to give them the field trip?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I assume that it\xe2\x80\x99s Border Patrol personnel who will be helping to guide the tour.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of who exactly it is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also, to follow up -- because Senator McCain has indicated to the media \xe2\x80\x9chow challenging the border is\xe2\x80\x9d in interviews, and because also Senator Leahy has also described his concern about the time, the calendar as it\xe2\x80\x99s going along with his committee, I want to get back to the question:\xc2\xa0 Is there a time period in which the President will say, I want to jettison -- I want to add some momentum to this, and I have a bill in my pocket and I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to put it out there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point out that Senator McCain has many times expressed his view of the difficulty of trying to secure the border.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I think that even he has acknowledged in recent months the progress that\'s been made there in terms of the commitment of resources and the impact that\'s had on the border.\xc2\xa0 I know that because of our efforts, that apprehensions continue to decrease and seizures actually are increasing.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good indication that the measures that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking along the border to secure it are having a tangible impact on the law enforcement efforts that are underway there right now.\xc2\xa0 So that part of it is clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of what impact this has on the legislative process, it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.\xc2\xa0 The President has also been clear that if that progress stalls, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared to act, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared to act in a way that will move the process along.\xc2\xa0 But right now there\xe2\x80\x99s not a need for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re in a place where members of the Senate on both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- are working constructively to try to find some common ground to put in place a policy that will finally fix our broken immigration system, and we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by that progress.</p>\n<p>So, Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Amy, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been a string of senators who have come out and supported gay marriage this week, and I wonder if the President has sort of weighed in on that, and if he feels somewhat responsible for kind of clearing the way for these people to come out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- so to speak, I guess.\xc2\xa0 I got asked this question a couple of weeks ago, after Senator Portman made his announcement about his changing view on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about any of the specific announcements that have been made by other senators in recent days on this issue, but I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to something I referred to a couple of weeks ago when asked about this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a pretty significant change in this country, where an issue related to equality and fairness is getting more prominence.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a testament to the character of this country that we are moving in a direction where we will better fulfill some of the founding principles of the country -- in terms of treating everybody fairly and equally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what\xe2\x80\x99s notable, I think, about this circumstance is it\xe2\x80\x99s happening really fast.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing history change right before our eyes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a notable event.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President himself, when he talked about his own changing perspective on this issue, acknowledged the rapid nature of that change and how significant it was for the country.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of response to specific changes, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:25 P.M.
