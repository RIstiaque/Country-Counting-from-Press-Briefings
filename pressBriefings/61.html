EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just give you a little bit of a rundown on the day, and then we can go into your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is joined on the plane today by a couple of members of the Michigan congressional delegation. \xc2\xa0So Congressman Debbie Dingell and Congressman Dan Kildee are on board. \xc2\xa0There are also senior administration officials who have been playing an important role in responding to the situation in Flint also on board. \xc2\xa0Those are Secretary of HHS Sylvia Burwell, the Administrator of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, and Dr. Nicole Lurie, who is an assistant secretary at Health and Human Services. \xc2\xa0She has been the lead federal official on the ground in Flint as we\xe2\x80\x99ve coordinated a significant federal response to this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we arrive in Flint, we anticipate that Governor Snyder and Mayor Weaver will both be on the ground to welcome the President to Michigan. \xc2\xa0The President will first head to a location -- this food bank in Flint that has been a hub of activity in providing some needed relief and supplies to citizens in Flint. \xc2\xa0While there, the President will meet with a wide range of federal officials who have been working on the ground to coordinate the federal response. \xc2\xa0The President will receive a briefing about that federal response. \xc2\xa0Both Mayor Weaver and Governor Snyder will participate in that meeting, because the focus of our efforts has not just been to mobilize federal resources, but to ensure that they have been effectively integrated with the resources that have been mobilized by state and local officials, as well. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from the President during that meeting, either before or after. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if that spray will be at the top or the bottom.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom there, we\xe2\x80\x99ll travel to a local high school where the President will have an opportunity to sit down and visit with six or eight members of the community to talk to a cross-section of the community about how they\xe2\x80\x99ve been affected by the situation. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a brief pool spray there so you can at least get photographs of the President doing that meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom there, the President will then deliver remarks to about 1,000 people from the community that will be in attendance at his speech. \xc2\xa0And that will be the end of the day, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll head back. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at. \xc2\xa0I think the message that you can anticipate from the President is something that will be familiar to all of you. \xc2\xa0The President will make a strong case that he cares deeply about the challenges facing the community of Flint. \xc2\xa0He will make clear that America is strongest when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking out for one another and that we have an obligation as a country to look out for everybody, including people in Flint who are dealing with some pretty tough circumstances even before there was these significant problems exposed in their water system.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President will make clear once again that this administration will continue to help mobilize resources necessary that will allow Flint to recover and come back stronger than ever. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on that even after broader national attention moves on to other things.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about -- you said 1,000 people. \xc2\xa0I mean, that seems more like a rally or some sort. \xc2\xa0I mean, who are the people, and how come so many? \xc2\xa0What are you trying to do with that crowd?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the goal of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit is for the President to deliver a message to the people in the community there. \xc2\xa0And we wanted to find a venue that would allow as many people as possible from the community in Flint to hear from their President firsthand, and to hear from their President directly. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so he\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have an opportunity to have a conversation with members of the community in a smaller setting, but we also wanted to provide a setting where the President could deliver a message in person to the people of Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And do you know how the tickets were distributed or who got the tickets?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but we can get you some more information about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there were a bunch of folks in a story that we posted on our website earlier today from the community that one of my colleagues talked to -- very critical of the EPA and the federal government as much as they are of the state government, as well. \xc2\xa0One woman was asked about President Obama coming and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat, that sounds wonderful, bring a check.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And very frustrated that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the resources to deal with the situation. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s his answer to that, and to that frustration generally?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think considering that many of the people in this community were serving poisoned water to their children for a year and a half or two years, their frustration is entirely justified. \xc2\xa0And I think the President is going to make clear that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an isolated incident of mismanagement. \xc2\xa0This also is reflective -- or this also reflects the dangers of government at all levels losing touch with the people that they were elected to serve.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it is evident from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response that the President is quite serious about making sure that the federal government is living up to its obligations to our citizens. \xc2\xa0We need Congress to take some common-sense steps here to make sure that the people of Flint and the state of Michigan has the resources it needs to address this problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThus far we\'ve seen Republicans in Congress not act as aggressively as they should to respond to this situation. \xc2\xa0There is more that Congress needs to do, and there is a role for Congress to play. \xc2\xa0And the commission that was established by the Governor to take a look at this situation ascribed almost all of the blame to failures by state regulators. \xc2\xa0And this is not an exercise in finger pointing, but an exercise in asserting the responsibility that everybody has to make sure that the people of Flint have an opportunity to get back on their feet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday, Governor Snyder called on the President to drink the water while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Flint. \xc2\xa0If he does decide to do that, does it send the wrong message that things are kind of okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\'t think -- look, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that thinks that what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in Flint is okay. \xc2\xa0I think what is true is that there have been important steps that have been taken -- both by state and federal officials -- that have made the water safe to drink if it\xe2\x80\x99s been properly filtered.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why you\'ve had federal officials including from FEMA, but also a number of state officials, including law enforcement passing out water filters to people in the community so they can get access to clean, drinkable water. \xc2\xa0The President will follow the advice of our scientists and experts about whether or not the water is safe to drink. \xc2\xa0And the EPA and state regulators have both indicated that properly filtered water is safe to drink. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t know if the President is going to drink any filtered water in Flint or not, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t be avoiding it because it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary for him to do so. \xc2\xa0The water is safe to drink if it\xe2\x80\x99s been properly filtered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How does the President plan to keep the attention on Flint and the aid flowing after the cameras leave?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he certainly has given very clear instructions to his team that follow-through here is going to be critical. \xc2\xa0And over the last three months or so, I think we\'ve seen quite effective follow-through on the part of federal officials. \xc2\xa0Nine million liters of water has been distributed. \xc2\xa0Hundreds of thousands of filters and filter cartridges have been distributed through the community. \xc2\xa0Those are resources that were mobilized largely by the federal government. \xc2\xa0You\'ve seen steps taken by the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to Medicaid to ensure that people can get access to health care up to the age of 21. \xc2\xa0They\'ve increased funding for community health centers to make sure that those new patients have doctors that they can see and facilities where those exams can be conducted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo an aggressive federal response on the part of this administration has been mobilized. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s had an impact and an important impact, a positive one. \xc2\xa0The President is proud of that. \xc2\xa0But this is a situation that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have existed in the first place. \xc2\xa0And the President wants to have a discussion about what we can do to make sure that situations like Flint don\'t crop up in other communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you the President does not believe that eliminating the EPA, for example, is going to prevent this from happening in other places. \xc2\xa0We need an EPA that\'s properly funded and that\'s functioning effectively and properly coordinating with state-level officials to protect our air and water. \xc2\xa0Eliminating that agency, as many Republicans advocate, is not going to contribute to that goal. \xc2\xa0I think we can all agree on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, Josh, in terms of new resources, the administration has done as much as it can right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I pointed out, the administration has mobilized significant resources. \xc2\xa0We\'ve expedited infrastructure funding that could be used by the state of Michigan to benefit people in Flint. \xc2\xa0Millions of dollars in emergency relief has been provided -- both in the form of personnel who were working on the ground, but also in the form of bottled water and medical supplies, and water filters -- all of which reflects the resources of the American people, making sure that an American community is not left behind. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is more that needs to be done to address the root problem here. \xc2\xa0And the President is committed to following through in pressing for those solutions and pressing Congress to provide the necessary funding for those solutions. \xc2\xa0Thus far Republicans in Congress have blocked the kind of robust response that is clearly necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any comment on last night? \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s the Republican nominee according to Reince Priebus. \xc2\xa0And this sort of frees the President up to start saying what he wants to say about him, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is no denying that the President will have an active role in the general election. \xc2\xa0There continues to be a -- there are additional contests ahead, particularly on the Democratic side. \xc2\xa0And there are six months until Election Day. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will spend many of those days between now and Election Day making a strong case about the progress that our country has made over the last seven years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was President Ronald Reagan who laid out the central question that voters should ask themselves when they walk into the polling place: \xc2\xa0Are you better off than you were four years ago? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it is undeniable that our country is stronger, our economy is stronger, is safer than it was eight years ago. \xc2\xa0And so the question that voters will have to ask themselves is, do we want to scrap the strategy that\'s worked so effectively, or do we want to build on the progress that we\'ve made. \xc2\xa0And based on the amount of time and energy that President Obama has invested in avoiding a second Great Depression and rescuing the auto industry, growing our economy from the middle out, investing in job training, cutting taxes and making tax cuts permanent for middle-class families, and raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, mobilizing the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and to act to fight climate change -- I think the President\'s record is clear. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to be eager not just to defend that record, but also to advocate that the American people elect a 45th President that\'s committed to building on that progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the White House concerned at all that the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, continues to lose states this late in the Democratic primary? \xc2\xa0I mean, is this a sign that there\'s any weaknesses going into obviously what\'s going to be a tough battle against probably Donald Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, in each of these states, there are competitive contests. \xc2\xa0And that\'s been the case for a couple of months now. \xc2\xa0I think what is -- there are a number of conclusions that can be drawn about that process. \xc2\xa0I think an important one is that in every state that we have seen, exit polls indicate that Democratic voters have been excited and motivated by the choices that are on the ballot for them. \xc2\xa0The exit polls of Republican voters tell a different story. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s a consequence of the different kinds of campaigns that have been waged by candidates in the two parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, ultimately the voters are going to have to draw their own conclusions. \xc2\xa0But there\'s no denying that the competitive Democratic contest has had a positive effect in engaging and motivating and exciting Democratic voters all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, even if it goes to a contested convention, would the President support something like a contested convention? \xc2\xa0Do you think that would be healthy for the party to keep the competition all the way to the finish?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Most of the analysis that I have seen has indicated that that is not at all likely to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What was the President\'s reaction to Senator Cruz dropping out last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he had one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'d be surprised if he had one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think he was watching the results come in, or watching sports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m confident that he was not watching the results come in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Syria, does the President have any plans to call President Putin about maybe pushing al-Assad to go a little softer on the opposition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not aware of any phone calls with President Putin that are planned. \xc2\xa0If one does get scheduled, we\'ll let you know after it has occurred. \xc2\xa0The President has had a number of occasions just over the last three or four months to strongly impress upon President Putin the need to persuade the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of a cessation of hostilities and engage constructively in the political talks that are being led by the U.N.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, President Obama did succeed in persuading President Putin to intervene, and that\'s why we saw for several weeks the successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities that many people were skeptical about. \xc2\xa0So President Putin did it once before. \xc2\xa0He should do it again. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, when we get back from this trip, the President will be appearing tonight at a gala for Asian Pacific Islanders. \xc2\xa0And it\'s a pretty large group, and I\'m just wondering if the President has a specific message that he wants to deliver tonight. \xc2\xa0And this is not a group that\'s often talked about -- sort of as political prowess on national elections. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if he\'s going to deliver a message about getting involved in the election cycle, really try to talk about the political season at all, or whether it\'s a different kind of message.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I think the President will primarily focus on the important role that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make to our country. \xc2\xa0And this is primarily an opportunity to honor those public servants who have not just represented that community but served our country in an important way. \xc2\xa0Look, what\'s also undeniable is that the fastest-growing voting bloc in America are actually Asian Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think you could anticipate that the President will also make a strong case that the values that he\'s been fighting for over the last seven years, and the progress that we\'ve made over the last seven years has certainly benefitted Asian Americans all across the country. \xc2\xa0And that\'s a record to be proud of. \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly a record that the President is proud of, but it\'s also a record that Democrats in Congress can be proud of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Congressman Kildee is on the plane. \xc2\xa0He\'s been trying to facilitate a meeting between Amir Hekmati, who\xe2\x80\x99s from Flint -- one of the Iranian hostages that was released -- and the President. \xc2\xa0Do you know if they\'re going to encounter each other today at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of a plan for a meeting like that to occur. \xc2\xa0But I\'ll keep my eye out and see if I can give you a head\'s up if it does happen. \xc2\xa0Obviously, administration officials have been in frequent touch with the Hekmati family, both leading up to -- both in the years that he was held in captivity, but also in the immediate aftermath of his release. \xc2\xa0But I\'m not aware of a plan for that kind of meeting to occur on this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about Little Miss Flint? \xc2\xa0Is she going to be at the roundtable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Little Miss Flint will be participating in today\'s events, and the President is looking forward to the opportunity to meet her and to convey to her how inspired he was by her letter. \xc2\xa0This is a little girl who has taken action to defend her community. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s an example I think that we all can at least take note of, if not follow.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t11:32 A.M.
