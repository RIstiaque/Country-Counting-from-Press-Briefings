Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:43 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a call time for the Medal of Honor ceremony, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to keep this quick so everybody who wants to attend, or is scheduled to attend, can do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I just wanted to note at the top -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this quickly -- that you probably saw a blog post by Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer over the weekend that makes clear a couple of points, and that is that, first, there is no reason why we should allow the sequester, with its indiscriminate cuts, to take effect.\xc2\xa0 It is wholly false that the President has not put forward proposals that would eliminate the sequester.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s done it three times -- first, with his proposal to the super committee, which would have eliminated the sequester entirely.\xc2\xa0 That was the whole idea behind the super committee\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xc2\xa0 Second, with his budget.\xc2\xa0 And third, in his proposal to Speaker Boehner, which met Republicans more than halfway on spending cuts and entitlement reforms and revenues late last year.</p>\n<p>We call on Congress -- as you heard the President do -- to allow itself the time and space to work together towards a broader budget agreement that eliminates the sequester entirely and reduces our deficit further by passing a short-term delay in the sequester in a balanced, responsible way -- without drama, without delay, without inflicting the kind of unnecessary wound on our economy that we should absolutely not be allowing to happen at this time.</p>\n<p>So I would also like to address briefly the fallacious assertions that Republicans have been making about who wants the sequester and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear:\xc2\xa0 When the Budget Control Act passed on August 11th, 2011, through the House of Representatives, it passed by a vote of 269 to 161.\xc2\xa0 Based on statements by Republicans today, you would have thought that the vast majority of that vote was from Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Well, in fact, 174 of the 269 were Republicans, House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Only 95 Democrats voted for that bill.\xc2\xa0 And that included every Republican leader -- Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor, Congressman McCarthy, Congressman Ryan.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker of the House, John Boehner, that day told CBS, \xe2\x80\x9cI got 98 percent of what I wanted.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how that squares with some of the commentary we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On that issue, particularly on the short-term solution that buys time and space, some lawmakers are suggesting that Congress could give the President authority to better target some of these cuts in the short term.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be amenable to that?\xc2\xa0 That would be one way to avoid the kind of meat-cleaver approach that you say that sequester imposes on the budget.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you were in the seat on Friday; we had a pretty lengthy briefing -- gaggle with some experts on this.\xc2\xa0 There is simply -- there is no convenient exit ramp to the punitive nature of these across-the-board cuts.\xc2\xa0 They would have a devastating effect on our economy.\xc2\xa0 They would threaten the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Americans.\xc2\xa0 They would severely affect middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 They would harm our national security.\xc2\xa0 There is no means by which you can avoid that.</p>\n<p>The issue here is we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to have it happen.\xc2\xa0 The Congress passed on January 1st a measure that extended the sequester by two months, that bought it down, that delayed it to allow for more time and congressional consideration.\xc2\xa0 We need to do that again.\xc2\xa0 When the Congress did it just a few months ago, they did it in a way that was balanced.\xc2\xa0 They ought to do that again.\xc2\xa0 There is simply no reason that we should inflict this kind of direct harm on our economy when we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to; when, in fact, what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do here is, as the President said, embrace the fact that in Congress there is a movement towards returning to so-called regular order when it comes to budget processes, and to allow that process to move forward, allow it to generate, hopefully, a balanced deficit reduction plan that continues to invest in our economy in the right areas to help it grow; and let that produce -- that process produce a result that the President hopefully can sign.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we ought to take the common-sense measure to buy down the sequester without drama so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have, in the midst of a year when we are poised for further economic growth and job creation, a real setback to our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I see this as an offering.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just placing the authority -- some would say the responsibility -- on the White House to just identify where those short-term cuts could --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, and first of all, the -- as again, I would point you to the detailed briefing that was given here on Friday from some of the experts and this question was asked.\xc2\xa0 The law is written as it\xe2\x80\x99s written.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s punitive, it\xe2\x80\x99s across the board.\xc2\xa0 The way that it would have negative impacts would be felt in manners that would do great harm to our economy.</p>\n<p>And when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about $85 billion over the short period of time that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, the impact would be significant no matter how you applied it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick -- on the State of the Union, a lot of us are reporting about the emphasis on job creation and the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to talk about infrastructure, public works, emphasis on educational opportunities.\xc2\xa0 Those are things that he emphasized in his first term and, to some degree, they sound recycled.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be new about them this time, and does the President need to emphasize that the economy is perhaps in a worse place than it was before in order to make that case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the economy is not in a worse place than it was before.\xc2\xa0 If you talk about the comparison between now and when he gave his first State of the Union address, there is no comparison.\xc2\xa0 We were in economic freefall.\xc2\xa0 What the President has been saying and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will say again is that we are at a moment when the economy is poised to continue to grow, to continue to build on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, to continue to build on the job creation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved -- over 6.1 million jobs created by our businesses over the past 35 or 36 months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What is also true -- I mean, the idea that his emphasis on the need to continue to create jobs or to continue to have our manufacturing sector expand -- that work isn\xe2\x80\x99t done.\xc2\xa0 So you can believe that he will continue to focus on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times that his principal preoccupation as President has been the need to first reverse the devastating decline in our economy and then set it on a trajectory where it\xe2\x80\x99s growing in a way that helps the middle class, makes it more secure, and makes it expand so that those who are trying to reach into the middle -- to climb the ladder, if you will, into the middle class -- have that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 That is absolutely going to be his focus in the second term as it was in the first term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if that\'s his focus, in the speech are we going to hear specifics about new plans for manufacturing, new plans for these areas of economic growth?\xc2\xa0 Can we expect to hear that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I obviously will not get into specifics.\xc2\xa0 But you will hear in the President\'s State of the Union an outline from him for his plan to create jobs and grow the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The President has always viewed the two speeches, the Inaugural Address and the State of The Union, as two acts in the same play.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, while there was a focus on some of the other elements of the Inaugural Address, that the core emphasis that he has always placed in these big speeches remains the same and will remain the same, which is the need to make the economy work for the middle class, because the middle class is the engine that drives this country forward and which will, if it is given the right tools and the right opportunities, will drive us forward in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m not going to get into specifics in terms of my preview here of the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 But he will focus on the proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and help the economy grow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan to call for cuts in nuclear arms in his speech, as the New York Times has reported?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the President made clear publicly his desire to further reduce nuclear arms.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there was anything new in the story that suggested to the contrary.\xc2\xa0 His commitment to arms control and nuclear reductions is well known.\xc2\xa0 But I do not anticipate a new announcement in the State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans are being critical of the President\'s focus, what\'s expected to happen during the State of the Union on jobs and the economy, saying that he\'s now pivoting back to jobs and dropped the ball during his Inaugural Address.\xc2\xa0 Do they have a point there that the President hasn\'t been emphasizing job creation over the last few months and now is suddenly turning back to it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would argue that all the time we collectively spent at the end of the year right up until New Year\'s Day focused on a fiscal cliff deal was very much about the need to take action to ensure that we didn\'t inflict harm on our economy, to take action to ensure that regular folks out there, middle-class Americans, had tax cuts extended to allow them to make ends meet and to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t have the numbers for you, but it is simply a fact that while the Inaugural Address contained within it very powerful lines from the President about issues like comprehensive immigration reform or the need to address climate change or gun violence, all of those issues combined got less space, if you will, in the Inaugural Address than the economy and jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that reflects the overall approach that the President takes.</p>\n<p>It also reflects the fact that when you talk about an issue like comprehensive immigration reform, we\'re talking about an economic issue as businesses large and small will tell you.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\'ve been seeing so much support for bipartisan efforts from the business community to push forward comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\'s no pivot here.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s principal preoccupation since he ran for this office, beginning in 2007, has been what we need to do to make our economy work for the middle class, to help expand the middle class; to give average Americans the opportunities they need to help this economy grow and to help it be as strong and dominant in the 21st century as it was in the 20th.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear that again in the State of the Union Address tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how do you answer the critics who say despite all of what the President has done, or what the White House has -- this administration has been pushing, that unemployment still remains near 8 percent, and they see that as a failure?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I see it as a challenge, and I know the President does.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve always heard from the President, every time he addresses this issue, that while we have come far from the catastrophe that faced this country in January of 2009, we have come not nearly far enough.\xc2\xa0 We have not reached where we need to be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is that terrible recession, the Great Recession -- the worst economy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced in our lifetimes -- took nearly 9 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is an enormous hole.\xc2\xa0 And because of the efforts of the President and this administration and Congress, we have -- and our businesses and the grit and determination of the American people -- we have dug ourselves out partway of that hole, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 And we need to get even beyond digging ourselves out of the hole created by the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0 We need to build beyond that.\xc2\xa0 We need a foundation for our economy that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on bubbles, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on insubstantial things, but is founded on good jobs with good industries and sound economic policy going forward in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>I would -- if the critics happen to be those who supported adamantly, fervently, with a gleam in their eye, the policies that helped contribute to the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, I would ask them to examine that record and compare it to the record of job creation and economic growth that we have seen under this President since that terrible recession was ended and our economy and our economic fortunes were reversed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly on the Pope -- when did the President find out that the Pope would be retiring?\xc2\xa0 And anything more to add to that statement that was sent out earlier?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing more to add.\xc2\xa0 I think the President found out this morning, as we all did, about this decision, and that statement I think went out not long before I took the podium.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s statement mentioned --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon Karl from ABC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, yes, can you just clarify for me very clearly -- is the President open to raising the eligibility age for Medicare?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the right policy to take.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear in the proposals he put forward to John Boehner, that John Boehner walked away from late last year, that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make tough choices with regards to entitlement reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not that choice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about reducing the annual cost of living increases for Social Security recipients?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as part of a big deal, part of a comprehensive package that reduces our deficit and achieves that $4-trillion goal that was set out by so many people in and outside of government a number of years ago, he would consider that the hard choice that includes the so-called chain CPI, in fact, he put that on the table in his proposal, but not in a cherry-picked or piecemeal way.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s got to be part of a comprehensive package that asks that the burden be shared; that we don\xe2\x80\x99t, as some in Congress want, ask seniors to bear the burden of further deficit reduction alone, or middle-class families who are struggling to send their kids to college, or parents of children who are disabled who rely on programs to help them get through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s just not fair and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make economic sense -- because the choice would be, let\xe2\x80\x99s do that, but hold harmless the wealthy; let\xe2\x80\x99s do that, put the burden on seniors alone, but not close loopholes in our tax code that are available to wealthy individuals or corporations, but not to average folks or small businesses.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>How do you explain to a senior that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this, asking you to sacrifice, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that corporate jet owners should lose their special tax incentive; we\xe2\x80\x99re not saying to oil and gas companies who are making record profits that they should forego these huge subsidies that taxpayers provide?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair and it\xe2\x80\x99s not good economics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I just want to be clear what you said at the beginning of that answer, which is the President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is not our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as part of an overall balanced approach, he does not rule out effectively reducing benefits for Social Security recipients?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has put forward a technical change as part of a big deal -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s on the table -- that he put forward to the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker of the House, by the way, walked away from that deal even though it met the Republicans halfway on revenues and halfway on spending cuts and included some tough decisions by the President on entitlements.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker walked away from that deal.</p>\n<p>But as part of that deal, the technical change in the so-called CPI is possible in his own offer as part of a big deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick question on the Pope.\xc2\xa0 The statement that you put out a short while ago said that -- from the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have appreciated our work together over these last four years.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What work together with the Pope over the last four years was he referring to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t -- I think it is not a mystery to anybody who knows about the extraordinary good works that the Catholic Church does around the globe in so many ways.\xc2\xa0 So I think that was part of a broader effort.\xc2\xa0 This administration, this country, this government works closely with the Catholic Church on some of these issues, and I believe that\'s what he was talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we expect to hear from the President on cybersecurity in the State of the Union?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview sections, sentences, paragraphs, phrases from the speech.\xc2\xa0 You know that the President believes that cybersecurity is a very important issue.\xc2\xa0 It represents a huge challenge for our country.\xc2\xa0 He has called on Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Congress has thus far refused legislatively.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any previews to provide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it would be reasonable to expect him to do so again?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I leave it to you to judge what\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable, but I will simply say that this is an important issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on jobs -- in Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question about the pivot back, et cetera, you said it was two acts in the same play -- the Inaugural Address and the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 When you go back to the Inaugural Address the word \xe2\x80\x9ceconomy\xe2\x80\x9d was used once, the word \xe2\x80\x9cjobs\xe2\x80\x9d was used twice.\xc2\xa0 So if there\xe2\x80\x99s this big emphasis on jobs and the economy in the State of the Union, how could they be two acts in the same play?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you heard what I just said.\xc2\xa0 If you actually look at the Inaugural in its totality there is as much on -- or more on the overall need to grow our economy and create jobs, diction aside, than on some of these other issues combined.\xc2\xa0 That does not take away from these other issues.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President act aggressively on comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President put forward a series of comprehensive proposals to reduce gun violence in this country in the recent weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are important priorities of the President and of the nation.\xc2\xa0 But what remains his number-one priority is what it has been since he took office, which is to get this economy growing, get it creating jobs, strengthening the middle class, and expanding the middle class -- allowing those who seek and aspire to the middle class to get there, giving them the tools to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But haven\xe2\x80\x99t we been seeing him in recent weeks -- and even after the State of the Union with some of his travel he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be going to places where he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about gun control, not talking about jobs and the economy.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will be traveling in the wake of the State of the Union on three separate days talking about the economy and the need to create jobs at every location he goes to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last thing -- Quinnipiac had a poll last week on the economy that found 53 percent of the country still believes we\xe2\x80\x99re in recession.\xc2\xa0 What can he say then, tomorrow night, to sort of put those people who still feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re in a recession, even if technically we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- what can he say that\xe2\x80\x99s new, that\xe2\x80\x99s different, that can make them feel better?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would suggest that he would address those Americans directly and talk about the need for Washington to take positive action to help the economy grow, to help it create jobs; the need for Washington to refrain from taking negative action by allowing, for example, the sequester to kick in, which would do direct harm to Americans, direct harm to the middle class, direct harm to our defense industries and national security interests.</p>\n<p>The President understands fully that we have work to do on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We are not done, not even close.\xc2\xa0 We need this economy to continue to grow.\xc2\xa0 We need it to grow faster.\xc2\xa0 We need it to create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 We need more investments that help the key industries of the 21st century take root here in the United States, a process that we have seen.\xc2\xa0 We need more companies to do -- to continue the trend that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen already in the last several years of repatriating their industries and jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We need more expansion of our manufacturing sector.\xc2\xa0 A remarkable turnaround in our manufacturing sector -- over half a million jobs in the last several years created in manufacturing after steep, steep decline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are positive trends but they are not irreversible and they are not completed.\xc2\xa0 So the President will talk to the American people tonight about the things we need to do together to have the economy create more jobs, have it continue to grow, have it create a foundation that allows for steady, further expansion in the 21st century, well beyond our time here -- both ours and this administration, and even yours in your seats -- so that we\'re making the right choices now for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a question about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on one of the Sunday broadcasts speaking specifically about the risk of cuts, referring to the sequester on the future of the United States -- she was talking about education and scientific research.\xc2\xa0 She said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is almost a false wrong to say we have a spending problem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President think we have a spending problem?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I feel like this is a little bit of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu here.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the President believes that we have a spending problem that is specifically driven by -- and I think every economist worth this -- whose insights into this area are worth the paper on which his or her Ph.D. is printed, would tell you that the principal driver when it comes to spending of our deficits and debt is health care spending.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s just a fact.\xc2\xa0 What is also a fact is that we have reduced nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level as a percentage of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.\xc2\xa0 And I think only some of you here were covering Eisenhower.\xc2\xa0 So that is a long time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meant that we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- so maybe<br/>\n\tTom?\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, there are people who have spent a long time covering and know this stuff back and forward, and they know this fact that nondefense discretionary spending has not been this low for generations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there aren\'t programs that should be eliminated -- and this President has been aggressive in finding them and taking action -- or that programs cannot be reformed in a way that save money.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we can\'t reform government in a way that saves money.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President has put forward to Congress exactly that in a proposal that would consolidate agencies and save taxpayers money.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is we need to reduce our health care costs.\xc2\xa0 Funnily enough, recognizing that fact, the President took action to do just that through the Affordable Care Act, which has been scored by the CBO to significantly reduce our health care costs going forward.\xc2\xa0 We need to do more.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward entitlement reforms that would further reduce our health care costs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe is that we need to simply shift our health care costs onto seniors -- basically say we\'ve got a problem that is now yours, Mr. 75-year-old American, or Mrs. 75-year-old American.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we ought to reduce these costs and not shift them onto seniors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, on Sunday, there was a LGBT rally, some groups protesting out front.\xc2\xa0 They felt that the President did not properly address their issues, as they believe he had promised in the course of his first term.\xc2\xa0 Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99s apparent willingness to move on the issue of ending discrimination against same-sex couples in the workplace, would the President issue an executive order prohibiting federal contractors --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question and I\'ve gotten it periodically.\xc2\xa0 We believe, the President believes, that we ought to move forward with congressional comprehensive action on this issue, and we will continue to press Congress to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it appears clear that that hasn\'t happened.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\'t happened to this point.\xc2\xa0 Would he be willing to pursue executive action?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What has happened dramatically is a series of changes when it comes to LGBT rights that reflect not just, but importantly, this President\'s action and influence and the pressure he has placed on -- and importance he\xe2\x80\x99s placed on these issues, but also a welcome change in the views held around the country on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to keep pressing for action from Congress on this very important issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the Hagel nomination in trouble?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe firmly that Senator Hagel will be confirmed as the next Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 Since his hearing, we have seen an increase in the number of senators who have come out and said that they will vote to confirm him.\xc2\xa0 That includes Republicans as well as Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to his hearing and to a vote on the floor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you make of the threats from Lindsey Graham, Inhofe and other Republicans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The threats to do what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The threats to filibuster his nomination, to put it on hold until they get more information on Benghazi?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to what Senator McCain said, who obviously has been very vocal in his views on a number of these issues where he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have never filibustered a Cabinet appointee and I do not believe we should filibuster his nomination" -- speaking of Senator Hagel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, the bottom line is we have 66,000 troops serving in Afghanistan and Iraq -- sorry, in Afghanistan rather, and significant issues to deal with internationally.\xc2\xa0 It is clear that Senator Hagel is uniquely qualified to be Secretary of Defense, and it is clear that he has at least a substantial -- a majority of senators who would vote to confirm him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We need to move forward with this nomination and make sure we have a Secretary of Defense, which is a key post when it comes to our national security interests.</p>\n<p>Margaret and then Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones on foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 To follow on this one, I believe what Senator Graham has indicated is that he wants to try to block both Hagel and Brennan until the White House answers questions about President Obama\'s direct involvement in Benghazi, including whether he called Libya to try to get the rescue crew moving and stuff about his conversations with the Joint Chiefs or the Secretary of Defense on the day of the attacks.\xc2\xa0 Are those specific questions, questions that the White House is going to answer publicly or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have answered these questions.\xc2\xa0 The President found out about the attack in Benghazi in a meeting with his Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from his National Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0 He immediately ordered those two leaders to take every action necessary to try to position forces in a way that could assist in Benghazi and also potentially take action if necessary elsewhere because of all that was unfolding around the region.\xc2\xa0 He was regularly updated and kept apprised of events in Benghazi and in the region throughout that evening and into the night.\xc2\xa0 Those are the facts.</p>\n<p>What is unfortunate here is the continuing attempt to politicize an issue -- in this case, through nominees that themselves had nothing to do with Benghazi -- and to do so in a way that only does harm to our national security interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Senator Hagel, Mr. Brennan -- they need to be confirmed.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re highly-qualified candidates for their posts, and we call on the Senate to act quickly to do just that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Israel there is now a renewed push by people who feel that Jonathan Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s sentence should be commuted and to ask the President to do that.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House is now or will be considering before the trip to Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, our position has not changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Could I just say on the matter of Benghazi, let\xe2\x80\x99s just not forget about this:\xc2\xa0 First, they demanded -- the critics, Senator Graham and others -- that Secretary Clinton testify, and she did for five hours.\xc2\xa0 Then Republicans demanded that Secretary Panetta testify before they could move on confirmation of a successor.\xc2\xa0 He did for many hours, as you know.\xc2\xa0 Now they are moving the goal posts yet again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Senior administration officials participated in 20 member and staff briefings on this issue, 10 congressional hearings, 6 witness interviews, and they responded to over 40 Benghazi-related inquiries from Congress, producing 10,000 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 The agencies have permitted members to view classified video footage from the night of the attacks and provided, again, as I said, over 10,000 pages of documents.</p>\n<p>And, fundamentally, they have focused on, as a rule, on an appearance on the Sunday shows in which a top administration official conveyed information that was, as she made clear, limited and based on our early understanding of what had happened, and could and would be subject to change, some of which turned out to be not precisely accurate.\xc2\xa0 That is not a reason to hold up the nominee for Secretary of Defense or the nominee for CIA Director.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on my colleague Ed Henry\xe2\x80\x99s question, not only will Americans be watching tomorrow night, but the world will be watching.\xc2\xa0 What comforting message can the President send the global financial community that, in fact, we will get through this particular period and the U.S. will not go back into recession, taking the whole world with it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that was a follow-up on Ed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about international viewers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He dresses --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s very good.\xc2\xa0 He could be British, the way he -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I meant that as a compliment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President a very clear call for the need to take action to help our economy grow and help it create jobs.\xc2\xa0 You will hear from him, a call -- as you have heard in the past, recently from him -- on Congress not to shoot the economy in the foot unnecessarily, to allow the sequester to kick in when it is wholly unnecessary to do that, when there is easy -- let\xe2\x80\x99s scratch easy -- but simple action that can be taken for which there is a template in the recent past.\xc2\xa0 And Congress ought to do that to give itself the time and space necessary to move forward on a broader budgetary process that produces balanced deficit reform that completely eliminates the sequester for good; the kind of action that the President supports, the kind of action that he has provided guidance for in detail -- far more detail than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans when it comes to broad-based, significant deficit reduction in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>So I think he is absolutely concerned that Congress do the right thing here, because it would be a very bad thing if Congress did not because of the impact on the economy, because of the impact on American workers and the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that that is a concern shared globally because of the importance that the American economy plays in the global economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, guys.\xc2\xa0 I know you got a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third row?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, third row.\xc2\xa0 April, last one.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of jobs, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the expansion of the middle class for employment, things of that nature.\xc2\xa0 What about sectors that have not seen the light of day, in some instances the black unemployment rate, the Hispanic unemployment rate, and also maybe even the teen unemployment rate?\xc2\xa0 Where is he going to weigh in on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview specific proposals or sections of the speech.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously an important component of the broader challenge here, which is that we need to further reduce unemployment.\xc2\xa0 There are areas of unemployment that pose specific challenges, and we need to take action to address those.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview presidential proposals from today, or the future, today here at the podium.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The best of times and the worst of times -- normally the State of the Union, the tone of the State of the Union is optimistic.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s always the State of the Union is strong pretty much.\xc2\xa0 Where is the state of our union as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about jobs and the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s for the President to address that specifically in the forum that is afforded to Presidents annually at Congress.\xc2\xa0 I would simply make the point that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made before:\xc2\xa0 We have come far since the depths of the worst recession in our lifetimes, but we still have a ways to go and we need to act accordingly.\xc2\xa0 We need to make the right choices, the right investments together with Congress to move our economy forward to help the middle class be more secure and expand.</p>\n<p>Got to run.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you brief tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Will there be any backgrounders on the address?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:17 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
