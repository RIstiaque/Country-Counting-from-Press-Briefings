Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:55 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 TGIF.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see all of you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have any announcements at the beginning, so we can go ahead and go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to start by asking a couple questions about the Islamic State hostage situation.\xc2\xa0 First of all, do you have any update on the fate of the Japanese journalist or the Jordanian pilot?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates, Nedra, but I would encourage you to check with either the Jordanian government or the Japanese government who could give you an update on their efforts to secure the release of their citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because some people in Jordan have been expressing the opinion that this pilot is paying the price for a war that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be involved in.\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all concerned that this could reduce public opinion within the Arab world or the U.S.-Arab coalition?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, I think the reason that we have had tremendous success in building a coalition of more than 60 nations to take the fight to ISIL and execute the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL, is that nations around the world reflect the risk that ISIL poses to nations in the region.\xc2\xa0 And particularly, a nation like Jordan understands the risk that they face from extremists.\xc2\xa0 And there are ambitions that have been articulated by ISIL to expand their footprint.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it was so important for countries from around the world to come together to face down this threat.</p>\n<p>And as the President was building this coalition, there was some doubt expressed about how much success he would have in enlisting the support of other Arab nations in this fight.\xc2\xa0 And we are pleased that nations like Jordan, like Saudi Arabia, like the UAE aren\xe2\x80\x99t just ready to stand with the United States in this endeavor to counteract, degrade, and ultimately destroy ISIL, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually joining the fight.\xc2\xa0 And we do see members of the military -- from Jordan, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia and others -- who are flying alongside American pilots, carrying out strikes against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And that, I do think, sends a clear signal to our enemies and to the world that the world is united to face down this threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic -- did the President have any reaction to his former opponent Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to seek the presidency again?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not have an opportunity to speak to the President since Governor Romney made his announcement.\xc2\xa0 But certainly Governor Romney is a man of great faith and a man who has tremendous loyalty and commitment to his country, and that is something that is worthy of our respect.\xc2\xa0 I confident that the announcement that he made today was a difficult one; I think he acknowledged as much.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also an intensely personal decision that candidates and their families make.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is he did say in recent days that he hoped that we could have more robust debate in this country about what we could do to put in place policies that benefit middle-class families; that he was articulating a concern that he had that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those at the top benefit quite a bit from our economic recovery, but not as much benefit being directed to middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously is a sentiment that the President himself has shared.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Governor Romney will be someone whose endorsement will be sought by other Republican candidates.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful that Governor Romney will use that influence to try to elevate the debate and have more attention and focus on policies that actually benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And surely we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have disagreements about the best way to do that.\xc2\xa0 But if that can be at least be our starting point, I think we would feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his remarks last night, the President seemed to relish a debate over poverty in the United States with Romney.\xc2\xa0 Is that the case?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think maybe he\xe2\x80\x99d be disappointed not to be able to have that debate now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is disappointed.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Nedra.<br/>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, he seemed, the President, last night to be tweaking the Governor a little bit without naming him by name.\xc2\xa0 Was that his intention?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that his intent was to note that we are seeing more rhetoric from Republicans indicating what was a previously unstated concern for people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t at the top.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly welcomes their interest in these issues.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, I think Governor Romney is genuine when he\xe2\x80\x99s articulating that concern.\xc2\xa0 The problem is -- and this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too often from the Republican side -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ve essentially used the middle class as a talking point and not actually put forward policies that benefit the middle class.</p>\n<p>So again, to the extent that Governor Romney can use his influence to try to change the fundamentals of this debate in a way that will actually focus on what we can do to benefit the middle class, and those who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the top 1 percent -- which is where so many of the Republican policies seem to be aimed -- then that would be a really good thing.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly would be a way for Governor Romney -- although he has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a candidate -- a way that he could substantially contribute to this debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a couple of other topics.\xc2\xa0 Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Central Bank cut its interest rate today in reaction to the possibility of a recession in the country.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about the effectiveness of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us any update on potentially more sanctions coming down the road?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I won\xe2\x80\x99t comment extensively on the actions that were taken by another central bank.\xc2\xa0 But I can say as a general matter that I also noticed that, within the last week or so, the Central Bank had actually raised interest rates dramatically to try to protect the value of their own currency.</p>\n<p>I think what this illustrates is, it illustrates that there is an element of chaos in the Russian economy, and some of that is a result of the international sanctions regime that this President has led the implementation of.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that there are specific and clear economic costs associated with President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s expedition into eastern Ukraine; that continuing to violate the territorial integrity of one of their neighbors is having an economic impact -- a negative one -- on Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as the days go by, and as Russia continues to refuse to live up to previous commitments that they have made to deescalate this conflict, those costs are only going to intensify.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that as these costs mount, that it will prompt the President, President Putin, to reevaluate his strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peace talks over Ukraine have also stopped before they began because of additional deaths of civilians there.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House watching that?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any specific reaction to those deaths?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine, and we have seen repeatedly that the Russians have been unwilling to live up to their agreements, and that a lot of these deaths of civilians are the result of military actions that are taken by separatists that are supported and armed by the Russian military.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that we need to change the cycle.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that as the international community continues to show their resolve, and as the costs continue to pile up on the Russian economy, that President Putin will ultimately change course.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the Greek government is having meetings this week.\xc2\xa0 The White House released a readout the other day of the President\xe2\x80\x99s discussion with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the new government\xe2\x80\x99s statement today that it will not cooperate with the IMF and European lenders about extending its aid package?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to that announcement.\xc2\xa0 I call tell you that, in general, the President telephoned Prime Minister Tsipras earlier this week, because the United States for a number of years now has been working closely with the EU and the Greeks to try to resolve so much of the financial and fiscal instability that we see over in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And that does have implications and an impact on the U.S. economy and on the global economy, of course.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with the EU, and that means engaging with the new political leaders in Greece to try to resolve these differences and get Greece and Europe and the global economy back on a path toward growth and prosperity, because that, ultimately, is going to be in the best interest of the U.S. economy.<br/>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First I wanted to ask about GDP.\xc2\xa0 It came in a little lower than expectations today.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has spoken a lot recently about how kind of promising economic signs are the reason that with this budget we can invest more in sort of all his priorities.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that some of the international factors that are dragging on now the U.S. economy are going to undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to sort of make that argument?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that that may end up being true, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the GDP numbers that were released today are much evidence of that.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, this is one snapshot.\xc2\xa0 And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say for years up here now, we don\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited about one great economic report, or too disappointed by one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet expectations.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at are the longer trends.\xc2\xa0 And even if you look at the more recent trends, just in the last six months of 2014, the economy grew at a rate of 4 percent.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly a pretty robust rate of growth, and that\xe2\x80\x99s momentum that we want to build on.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why so many of the policies that the President laid out in the State of the Union would try to capitalize on that momentum.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the same time, we have said -- and this is what I tried to acknowledge at the beginning of my answer to your question -- is that there are consequences for a slowdown in the international economy on the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 And we do continue to be concerned about some of those things.\xc2\xa0 Jason Furman appeared in the briefing with me about a little over a month ago now, and talked about some of the potential impacts from the slowing global economy.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, our work with the Europeans that Jeff asked about, is evidence of our ongoing efforts to work with the international community to strengthen the economy around the globe because that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have important benefits for the U.S. economy here at home.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last night in Philadelphia, it sounded like there was a lively exchange on trade between the President and House Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the President promised to loop them in more as these trade deals are being developed, and kind of made his argument for why they were important.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering after that discussion if you guys feel as if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the 50 or so House Democrats that you need for Trade Promotion Authority.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to count votes last night.\xc2\xa0 The President was there to have a conversation about his strategy when it comes to these conversations about opening up markets for American exports.\xc2\xa0 And the President did lay out a pretty compelling case; it\xe2\x80\x99s not that different than the case you heard him make in the State of the Union.</p>\n<p>So this is a process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have a conversation with Democrats and Republicans, both supporters of these kinds of trade agreements and some people who have indicated an opposition to them.\xc2\xa0 The President does have a strong case to make about how an agreement that he will sign will only be an agreement that is in the best interest of American middle-class families and in the best interest of American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And that will sort of be the guidepost as we pursue this agreement with a range of other countries in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ll make our case to Democrats and Republicans alike along those lines.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President over the course of the last six years, based on the success that his policies have had in strengthening our economy after the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, should give those who are concerned about the middle class some confidence that the President knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about when he says he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go out and stand up for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t counting votes, did the President come away from that feeling as if there was enough Democratic support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that the President came away with the impression that people were focused on this issue, and I do think that he came away with the impression that he got a fair hearing from the Democrats who were in attendance.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that every single Democrat is going to end up voting for this thing, but I do think that as long as people give the President an opportunity to present the facts and to ask legitimate questions about the details of the agreement, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- then I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have an opportunity to continue to make our case and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to win some support as a result.</p>\n<p>Mr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Israel has announced --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was there earlier this week, but we can go back if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Israel has announced plans to build 450 units on the West Bank.\xc2\xa0 The chief Palestinian negotiator has said that this is a result of impunity granted to Israel, a reference to the speech that the Speaker has invited the Prime Minister to make here.\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to the announcement by Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, we\xe2\x80\x99ve, on a number of occasions, had the opportunity to make clear our position on settlement activity.\xc2\xa0 Our position is that we believe that settlements are illegitimate and counterproductive to achieving a two-state outcome.\xc2\xa0 We have deep concerns about these highly contentious settlement construction announcements.\xc2\xa0 They will have detrimental impacts on the ground, inflame already-heightened tensions with the Palestinians, and further isolate the Israelis internationally.\xc2\xa0 The United States, as a close ally of Israel, works -- uses our diplomatic influence around the globe to try to build support for Israel, and an announcement like this only serves to further isolate them.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that issuing tenders like this does nothing to bolster Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0 It does not increase its prosperity and it does not further the cause for peace; in fact, it does precisely the opposite.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you suspect a political motive on the part of the Prime Minister, coming so soon before the elections, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve alluded to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me exactly what their motive is.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that this, in our view, would only undermine the ability of the Israelis to build support internationally and to ultimately secure the kind of peace agreement with a two-state outcome that we believe is clearly in the best interest of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the reports that one of the five Taliban fighters who was traded last year for Bowe Bergdahl has reached out to try to make contact with the Taliban?\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you there are a couple of facts that are important that should be reflected in the reporting.\xc2\xa0 The first is, is that none of these individuals has returned to the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 None of them is allowed to travel outside of Qatar, and none has engaged in physical violence.\xc2\xa0 In fact, each of them at this moment is still in Qatar, and each of them is subject to monitoring and other mitigation measures that limit their activities.</p>\n<p>I can also tell you that we are regularly in touch with the Qataris about those mitigation efforts.\xc2\xa0 And in light of the concerns that you have raised, I can tell you that those mitigation efforts and those monitoring efforts have been updated to reflect those concerns.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you, because of the cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from the Qataris and because of the conversations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had with our national security team here in the administration, that we continue to have confidence that there are measures in place to substantially mitigate the threat that they pose to American national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be specific?\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cupdated\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Mitigation efforts have been updated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position I think for some -- for a variety of reasons, some of which are obvious, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to detail the mitigation efforts that are in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re making the point that this individual hasn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to the battlefield, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it suggest that releasing these prisoners could potentially pose a threat to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when this transfer from Guantanamo Bay -- from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to Qatar, that the Secretary of Defense had independently certified that there were sufficient mitigation measures in place to substantially mitigate the threat that they posed to American national security.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Hagel certified as such last summer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the success of those mitigation measures depends on the cooperation of the Qatari government, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to report to you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten good cooperation and there is good coordination between the United States and the Qatari government about these measures that need to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we are updating them to reflect some of these concerns I think is evidence that we have a system in place that is protecting American national security right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fact that this contact happened in the first place -- will it make the administration, has it made the administration re-think the effort to essentially close Guantanamo, to step up its release of some of these prisoners?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it does not, and simply because keeping the prison open undermines our national security.\xc2\xa0 That is the view of the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been his view since he campaigned for this office in the first place.\xc2\xa0 It actually was the view of the previous administration, who also advocated for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>The fact is, the prison at Guantanamo Bay only serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists.\xc2\xa0 It drains our resources.\xc2\xa0 As the President mentioned in the State of the Union address, we spend $3 million a year per prisoner to keep them locked up at the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is not a good use of our resources.\xc2\xa0 And the opening of that prison -- or the prison\xe2\x80\x99s continued operation has only served to damage our relationships with countries around the world, countries we rely on to protect our national security.</p>\n<p>So the President believes that it is an easy call that we need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 And as we transfer prisoners from the prison, we need to make sure that we have measures in place to mitigate the risk that those individuals pose to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And in the case of these five individuals, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to put a fine point on it, you can say with confidence that this individual right now does not continue to pose a threat to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say with confidence is this individual has not returned to the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 This individual is not allowed to travel outside Qatar.\xc2\xa0 And this individual has not engaged in any physical violence.\xc2\xa0 In fact, this individual is still in Qatar right now, and is subject to monitoring measures that mitigate the threat that this individual poses to the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask you about something here at home.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern, particularly among the CDC officials, about this recent spread of measles.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now impacting people in 14 different states.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been concern, as we get closer to the Super Bowl.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House?\xc2\xa0 How closely is the President being informed by the CDC?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the CDC is obviously monitoring this very closely, and we have our public health experts across the country who are taking a careful look at this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think what those experts would tell you is that their recommendation is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick, we recommend that you don\xe2\x80\x99t get on an airplane and you don\xe2\x80\x99t go to crowded locations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true of the flu and other illnesses as well.</p>\n<p>But this obviously is an illness that\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit more potent than the flu, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly attracted the attention of our public health professionals both here in the federal government but also in states and communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to closely monitor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously it has revived the debate over vaccines.\xc2\xa0 Does the President, does the White House have a message about that and who will be getting vaccinated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly believes that these kinds of decisions are decisions that should be made by parents, because ultimately when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about vaccinations, we\xe2\x80\x99re typically talking about vaccinations that are given to children.\xc2\xa0 But the science on this, as our public health professionals I\xe2\x80\x99m sure would be happy to tell you, the science on this is really clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That people should get vaccinated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what the science indicates, and that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously what our public health professionals recommend.\xc2\xa0 And being guided by the science in matters like this is typically the right approach.<br/>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 An interesting question posed by Politico today about lurching leftward from a policy perspective, perhaps budgetary perspective.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair characterization of how the President is now leading?\xc2\xa0 Is there still an opportunity for a grand bargaining or centrist policies moving forward?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I think what I would say is that the President is driving towards the middle, not on the ideological spectrum, but driving toward the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that has exactly been the focal point of his domestic policymaking agenda since he took office.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s doubling down on that effort, and that was what was included in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when the President rolls out his budget on Monday, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have an orientation in that budget where we make clear that our priority is middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply that when our economy is growing from the middle out, we know that our economy is on its strongest footing.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we can do to support middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- if supporting middle-class families means that you\xe2\x80\x99re more oriented to the progressive end of the ideological spectrum, so be it.\xc2\xa0 But that certainly -- what the President is focused on is the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to switch gears for just a second and ask you about immigration.\xc2\xa0 I know a great deal has been talked about with respect to the people that are already here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about policy moving forward for those who would like to work here and be here for longer periods.\xc2\xa0 There are thousands, if not more, Canadians, for example, that come here, they do good jobs, and then they have to go back because it\xe2\x80\x99s a time limitation.\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought to sort of expanding that opportunity as you continue to unpack immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, this is one of the tragedies of the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to even consider a vote on the bipartisan legislation that passed through the Senate early in 2013.\xc2\xa0 That legislation included a wide variety of things, but one of the important things it included were reform of our legal immigration system, that there should be some things that we can do to better attract talent from all across the world and entrepreneurs from all across the world to make it easier for them to come to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And if they want to open a business and create jobs here in America, they should be able to have a clear path to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And right now, our system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t operate as efficiently as we would like, and it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t optimize our ability to retain talent that has come to the United States.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about individuals who left their home country to come to the United States to go to school and avail themselves of the most effective higher education system in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But yet, when their education system is up and they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to invent a new product or innovate in an exciting way, or open a new business, we tell them, sorry, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to go back to your home country.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that makes a lot of sense.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the Chamber of Commerce and a number of other business-friendly organizations that don\xe2\x80\x99t typically align themselves with the President agree with him, however, in this case, that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has said that he was going to use all of the power at his disposal, using his executive authority, to try to fix as much of our broken immigration system as possible.\xc2\xa0 But there is more work that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And we stand ready to work closely with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who are eager to join that fight.\xc2\xa0 And that fight should include reforms of our legal immigration system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing I wanted to ask you about.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a game coming on Sunday; perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching it.\xc2\xa0 A lot of fans in Seattle and in the New England area want to know:\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a team that he\xe2\x80\x99s picking this year?\xc2\xa0 Are you picking a team this year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is always rooting for the Chicago Bears.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, they\xe2\x80\x99re not in the game yet again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President told House Democrats last night that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to choose sides in this particular contest, but he\xe2\x80\x99s just hoping for a good game.\xc2\xa0 I think I can say the same thing for myself.<br/>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the House Republicans have put together a working group to draft an alternative, they say, to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Affordable Care Act, and doing so in anticipation of King v. Burwell before the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there is anything premature about putting together a working group in anticipation of a Supreme Court decision that may strike down a key component of the Affordable Care Act?\xc2\xa0 And in general, White House reaction to what has long been missing from the Republican argument about Obamacare, that is to say a full-blown legislative replacement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99d say, Major, is that they\xe2\x80\x99re not premature, they\xe2\x80\x99re about five years too late.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for years for Republicans to actually engage constructively in putting forward a plan to reform our health care system.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President had to drive so hard to get this across the finish line, because, again, he was obstructed at every turn by Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President has also said, since that success of passing health care reform that has expanded health insurance to millions more Americans, and actually limited the growth in health care cost to the lowest level in recorded history, that we welcome ideas from Republicans for actually improving the law.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, they voted more than 50 times to actually try and eliminate the law.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not really clear that either, A, Republicans are serious about putting forward their own plan, or, B, actually even serious about trying to reform our health care system in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s actually good for small business owners and middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there is anything to the idea that if King v. Burwell goes against the Affordable Care Act, the act itself becomes largely toothless in dealing with national health care?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, at this point we remain confident that the Supreme Court will take a close look at the arguments and conclude what so many other people have, which is that the common-sense reading of the legislation is that Congress always intended for individuals that are eligible to collect tax credits that make their health care more affordable, that they should be able to collect those tax credits regardless of who was operating their marketplace.</p>\n<p>So we remain confident in that.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, what we found from Republicans who are raising those concerns, those are the same Republicans who voted against the Affordable Care Act in the first place.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take their concerns very seriously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, Strobe Talbot, Michele Flournoy and several others will put forward a recommendation on administration policy in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Among the things they\xe2\x80\x99re going to suggest is that this administration provide military equipment to Ukraine because after many, many months of using economic sanctions, they will argue the Ukrainian government needs financial resources of a greater degree than so far provided, and the military means by which to make the continued use of Russian separatists too painful for Russia.\xc2\xa0 Is this administration willing to give any consideration more seriously than it has to date to the concept of arming -- or providing arms to the Ukrainian government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that anybody here has had a chance to take a look at that report, so when it\xe2\x80\x99s issued on Monday I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a close look at it.</p>\n<p>I know that there are a couple of things that it sounds like we may have some agreement with their proposals, based on the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described them.\xc2\xa0 The first is that there is substantially more financial support that we can offer the Ukrainian government; that as a result of this instability in their country that\xe2\x80\x99s been fomented and aided and abetted by the Russians, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve sustained some pretty significant economic costs themselves.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President earlier this year called for Congress to act on a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And consistent with some reforms that they put in place, we\xe2\x80\x99d be in favor of even additional support beyond that, in the second half of this year.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how that moves forward.</p>\n<p>The second thing is, the President has been urging Congress to approve of some long overdue reforms at the IMF that would bolster the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s ability to offer some financial assistance to the Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0 So at least that element of the report, the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described it, is consistent with our view that there is more that we can and should do to support the Ukrainians financially.</p>\n<p>As it relates to military support, the President has been reluctant to do that, principally because in his mind --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he becoming more open to it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at this point what I would say is, he continues to be reluctant -- because ultimately there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a military solution to this problem.\xc2\xa0 This is the kind of dispute that has to be resolved diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And what we need to do is we need to see the Russians actually abide by the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already made at the negotiating table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The arguments from Strobe Talbot and Michele Flournoy, as someone -- obviously the President is very familiar with both, is that that\xe2\x80\x99s been tested; that there has to be a military price, and the Russians need to begin to feel it, and the Ukrainians need to have a sense they can defend themselves and not see civilian casualties and other destruction continue for there to be a different conclusion on the Russian side about the necessity of reaching the political accommodation you\xe2\x80\x99ve just described.\xc2\xa0 Does the President disagree with that fundamentally?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d look at their report before I pronounced a judgment on it one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a reasonable point of view.\xc2\xa0 But the other part of this that we have to remember is that the longer that the sanctions remain in place, the worst the economic costs that Russia has to bear get.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced even by the Russian Central Bank today that they\xe2\x80\x99re having to -- that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to attempt to lower their interest rates just a few days after increasing them significantly.\xc2\xa0 So there is an element of chaos in the Russian economy that\xe2\x80\x99s only getting worse by the day.</p>\n<p>So I think it is too early to say that the economic costs that Russia has to bear as a result of their incursions into Ukraine are not sufficient to get them to change their mind, and will not.\xc2\xa0 They haven\'t been so far, obviously.\xc2\xa0 But as those costs mount, there still is the possibility that it could prompt them to reevaluate their strategy in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions on trade.\xc2\xa0 Is 50 votes in the House, on the Democrat side, the White House benchmark?\xc2\xa0 And what is it about this argument you think House Democrats who oppose this already, sight unseen, don\xe2\x80\x99t get about the new global economy and what this trade deal might mean for the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to establish a benchmark in terms of the number of Democratic votes that we\xe2\x80\x99d expect for this legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or that you\xe2\x80\x99d seek.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99d seek is a majority in the House of Representatives for the bill.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\xe2\x80\x99s all Republicans or a bunch of Republicans and a small number of Democrats is, frankly, not something that we\xe2\x80\x99re particularly concerned about.\xc2\xa0 We actually just want to see this piece of legislation pass.</p>\n<p>On your second question about what it is that we will try to persuade reluctant Democrats, at least, about this matter is I think we\xe2\x80\x99d try to persuade them about two facts.\xc2\xa0 The first is, there is significant risk associated with not engaging in this region of the world; that if the United States were to stand back and say, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to enter into any sort of economic agreements with countries in the Asia Pacific, it only serves to create an opening for China to step in and start writing the rules of the road in a way that is certainly not advantageous to American businesses and certainly not advantageous to American workers.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it would put Americans businesses and American workers at a significant disadvantage if China were to go in and start writing the rules of engagement with a bunch of other countries in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to go into that situation and attempt to set a higher standard and to raise standards in a way that will level the playing field and create opportunities for American businesses to grow and thrive and open up access to markets in other countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about countries that have, combined, a large population and a lot of customers, a lot of potential customers.\xc2\xa0 So there is an opportunity to be seized here, but there also is a cost associated with failing to seize it, and that is what is on the mind of the President.</p>\n<p>And I think the second thing is -- and again, this is what I would expect to be an argument that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty persuasive for a lot of Democrats in Congress -- when the President says he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign an agreement that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe is clearly in the best interest of American middle-class families, he means it.\xc2\xa0 And there is an interest that other countries obviously have in trying to strike an agreement with the United States.\xc2\xa0 This is the most dynamic economy in the world, and it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that other countries would want to have more access to sell their goods here or to locate some of their businesses here.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of got -- the carrot on the other end of the stick is making sure that this is an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of American businesses and American middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And that is the criteria that the President will use to evaluate this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as I mentioned, over the last six years or so, has put in place a whole host of policies that are clearly in the interest of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s got some credibility built up around these issues.</p>\n<p>And again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that argument to carry the day with every single Democrat in the House of Representatives, but I do think that the President deserves, and so far has gotten, a fair hearing.\xc2\xa0 But this is a case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making in the weeks ahead.<br/>\n\tJim.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to put a finer point on the measles vaccine issue.\xc2\xa0 When you say that it\xe2\x80\x99s the parents -- you prefaced your comments by saying that parents would have that decision.\xc2\xa0 Are you supporting those who not for religious reasons, but because they have a special reason for it which may be based upon faulty science, are holding their kids back from getting vaccines?\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that everybody should be listening to our public health professionals.\xc2\xa0 Our public health professionals are guided by the science.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who are steeped in this knowledge, they\xe2\x80\x99ve reviewed the studies, and then can offer the best advice to Americans about how they can best protect themselves and their kids from diseases like measles.</p>\n<p>So I guess my point is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand up here and dispense medical advice, but I am going to suggest that the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that people should evaluate this for themselves with a bias toward good science and toward the advice of our public health professionals who are trained to offer us exactly this kind of advice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as I understand the regulations now are, is that the federal rules are you have to get a vaccine to go to school, but if you have -- but there are exemptions, and the exemptions are for religious reasons and also if you have a special concern.\xc2\xa0 Does that law need to be addressed?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean we have to eliminate these special concerns, which are not based on science?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard any discussion about revising those rules, but this administration and our public health professionals rely on the best science available to give Americans the information that they need so that they can take the steps that are necessary to protect themselves and their families.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe is the most important rule for the government in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just, in the State of the Union, the President said that it was time for Congress to begin to lift the embargo in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that the legislation, which has been proposed by Senators Leahy -- in the Senate, Senators Leahy and Flake and Durbin, is what the President is talking about?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not talking asking for the embargo to be lifted, but for the travel restrictions to be lifted?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a step in the right direction, and I think it reflects the kind of bipartisan support there is for the policy proposal -- or the policy change that the President has started to implement on his own and has called for Congress to follow up on.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly welcome that piece of legislation, and hope it will get due consideration in both the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you think in this Congress, that the second step, the lifting of the embargo, will come up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is not the only person to support the lifting of the embargo.\xc2\xa0 There are Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the aisle who do support it, and the President will continue to advocate for it.<br/>\n\tAnnie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just mentioned earlier that you welcome Republican ideas to change Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 And one of those that may have come up today with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s push for medical research is supporting rescinding the medical device tax.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any movement on that at all, and particularly with this push that you guys are making.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s much of a connection between the medical device tax and the precision medicine announcement that the President made today.\xc2\xa0 The announcement that the President made today related to precision medicine is part of a substantial investment that he believes is necessary in the kind of medical innovations that could serve to dramatically overhaul health care in this country in a way that would have tremendous benefits for the health and wellbeing of people all across the country.</p>\n<p>The President is also supportive of those kinds of investments because they have important economic benefits as well.\xc2\xa0 Right now it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to predict exactly what kind of businesses could sprout up around some of these innovations, but there is tremendous economic potential associated with a lot of this research.</p>\n<p>And so, for both of those reasons, the President strongly believes that this is a worthwhile investment, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details about what that investment actually is in his budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, many of those companies, though -- many of the companies that come up with these innovations are pushing for the medical device tax to be rescinded for that very reason.\xc2\xa0 And it will give them more time and more resources to put into research.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly have indicated a willingness to have a conversation with Republicans about the medical device tax.\xc2\xa0 I know some of them have expressed some concerns about it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly willing to have that conversation.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason why that medical device tax would in any way limit the kind of innovation that the President believes could revolutionize health care and has great economic potential for both those well-established health care companies, but also new companies that could emerge as a result of some of this new technology.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just on the Super Bowl, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has any thoughts about either what the NFL has done on domestic violence or on the issue of concussions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think has been covered in a lot of the reporting, this has been a challenging year for the NFL, and there are a range of important issues that I think even they\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that they need to address.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\'t heard the President sort of evaluate the specific response of the NFL to some of these challenges, but certainly acknowledging that these challenges exist is an important first step, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the NFL has done that.<br/>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks last night, specifically when he referenced Governor Romney, the President did say that Governor Romney is a former presidential candidate on the other side, who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty.\xc2\xa0 He was zinging Romney, was he not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think the President was observing a phenomenon that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen emerge from the mouths of many members of the Republican Party in the last few months; that all of a sudden, a party that has for years advocated policies that benefit those at the top, with the expectation that those benefits may trickle down to those in the middle, that all of a sudden, at least some Republicans seem to be changing their tune and indicating that they\xe2\x80\x99re now actually all of a sudden interested in helping middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 The President welcomes their interest, but is hopeful that their interest is a signal of actual policy proposals and not just a new set of talking points.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much does the President expect his message, the one that he delivered last night, the message that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to convey in this upcoming budget proposal, is picked up by Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party heading into 2016?\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to set the table for whoever may be running for that nomination in 2016?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, the short answer to the question is no.\xc2\xa0 What the President is trying to do is he wants to set the table for some progress for the country over the course of the two remaining years of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that he can work with Congress to make some of that progress.\xc2\xa0 The President is also the first to acknowledge that he may have to take some steps on his own to realize some of that progress, and he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to do both.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is going to be focused on for the last two years, and there will be this other presidential campaign that\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be some people who are running for President who are going to be critical of some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals, and there will be some people who are running for President who will compliment the President for some of the proposals that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.\xc2\xa0 And the President is happy to be a part of that debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But ultimately, the debate that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have will be one that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the middle class and focused on how we can make progress for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The people who are part of that campaign will be making the case for the country about how they can make that progress, if they\xe2\x80\x99re given the same kind of opportunity that this President has been given, to serve here in the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with Governor Romney making his decision today, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t any thoughts here at the White House as to how soon perhaps Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden should be making some decisions on the future?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll make those decisions on their own timeframe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I want to get back to the Bowe Bergdahl swap.\xc2\xa0 No regrets at this White House for that swap?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course not, Jim.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a principle that has a lot of precedent that this President is firmly committed to.\xc2\xa0 As the Commander-in-Chief, it\xe2\x80\x99s his responsibility that no man or woman who wears the uniform of the United States military is left behind.\xc2\xa0 And that is a principle that the President is committed to upholding, in the same way that commanders-in-chief before him upheld that principle.\xc2\xa0 And that, ultimately, is where this debate starts and stops for him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said that none of these individuals have returned to the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration confirmed that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when was that confirmation made?\xc2\xa0 Was that just made in recent days -- contacts made in recent days to confirm that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, we are -- the national security team here is in regular touch with our counterparts in Qatar.\xc2\xa0 And right now, these individuals are in Qatar and they are subjected to monitoring and mitigation measures that ensures that we\xe2\x80\x99re limiting their activities and doing so in a way that protects the national security interest of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the United States is doing that monitoring, is that correct?\xc2\xa0 In conjunction with the allies there in the region?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, we\xe2\x80\x99re in close touch with the Qataris about these monitoring and mitigation procedures.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to be in a position to detail exactly what those are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just to button it up, the fact that this individual was perhaps in contact with people on the battlefield, or in that theater of concern, does that concern the White House?\xc2\xa0 It appears that was the case.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying not on the battlefield, making that distinction.\xc2\xa0 But perhaps making attempts to contact people on the battlefield, that should be a concern, I would think.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the individual concern that we have.\xc2\xa0 I can just say, as a general matter, that there have been concerns that have been raised about one individual, and that the monitoring and mitigation measures that were in place have been updated to reflect those concerns.\xc2\xa0 But I just can\xe2\x80\x99t get into the details of either what prompted those concerns, what the concerns are, or what the mitigation measures were.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by \xe2\x80\x9cupdated,\xe2\x80\x9d you mean intensified, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it would be fine for you to interpret it that way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And because of the drone concerns here at the White House earlier this week, and there have been some reports about drone concerns at the Super Bowl this weekend -- that people may try to do this sort of thing, and people have been told not to do that -- I mean, what is the Department of Homeland Security, I guess, activity related to that?\xc2\xa0 Is this a new concern?\xc2\xa0 Is this sort of a new phenomenon that the Department of Homeland Security is looking at, that the national security apparatus of this government is looking at with respect to keeping people safe this weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, this is a concern that is new in the headlines, but is a concern that our national security team, and specifically the Department of Homeland Security has been aware of and focused on for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you, as it relates to the White House, this is something that has been a subject of extensive conversation at the United States Secret Service, the agency that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for protecting the White House.\xc2\xa0 I also know that the Department of Homeland Security is involved in some of the security precautions that are put in place around the Super Bowl, as they are with other large gatherings like that.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Homeland Security to discuss what they can about the security measures that are in place to keep people safe when they\xe2\x80\x99re attending the Super Bowl today -- or this weekend.<br/>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to follow up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s question about King v. Burwell.\xc2\xa0 I know you said that you remain confident about the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 Is there any legislative proposal that the administration is considering that could potentially get through two Republican chambers of Congress that would fix the Affordable Care Act if the King v. Burwell decision went the other way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to go the other way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no legislative consideration happening to hedge any of those bets?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Republicans have indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99re, again, determined to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And for some reason, they think it\xe2\x80\x99s good politics to try to take health care away from people; I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly why that is.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the conclusion that they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached.\xc2\xa0 And they have said that they would block any sort of legislative improvements to the Affordable Care Act, and that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate but that\xe2\x80\x99s the situation as it exists.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that we continue to be confident that the Supreme Court is going to take a look at the legislation and consider what is a pretty straightforward reading -- that the Congress intended for individuals who are qualified to accept tax credits to make their health care more affordable can actually accept them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty simple principle, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we -- it is a conclusion that has been acknowledged by others who have looked at this.</p>\n<p>For example, when the Congressional Budget Office did a review of the Affordable Care Act, they did so, and their analysis indicated that they expected people who lived in states where the federal government was running their marketplace, that those people who be eligible to collect tax credits to make their health insurance more affordable.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if this is some sort of creative interpretation of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think it is rather the clear intent of those who wrote the law.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Supreme Court that has to decide this, but I think on its face it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of common sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So since the Republicans control both chambers of Congress, there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in the White House -- is this what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- pursuing a backstop proposal if the Supreme Court went the other way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Supreme Court is going to go the other way.\xc2\xa0 And even if they did, Republicans have said that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consider a legislative solution.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty busy here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would be a good use of our time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to Texas state representative, Molly White, and a decision that she made to put an Israeli flag on her desk and ask people to sign a pledge of allegiance to Muslims who were visiting her office yesterday?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House happen to have any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Jared.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s actually the first I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing of it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll go see if I can learn more about it.<br/>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Or not, maybe. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, April, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No problem.\xc2\xa0 No problem.\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to know, is Ferguson still a very special issue item that the President still looks at daily to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This broader issue, April, of strengthening the bonds of trust between local law enforcement officials and the citizens of the communities they serve is something that the President is very focused on.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, there is this commission that has been hard at work, that was appointed by the President, to take a look at some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 This is a commission that include members of law enforcement, some community and civil rights leaders and others, who could examine what some communities across the country have done to build this trust and to try to find ways to share those best practices with other communities across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So since you\xe2\x80\x99re still looking at that issue, what did the President say about the dust-up that happened in Ferguson as tensions are still very high between the black community and law enforcement there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I haven\'t talk to the President about it.\xc2\xa0 I have seen the news reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is an indication that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that needs to be done on this, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise to anybody, that some of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a federal level?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, actually in that community.\xc2\xa0 And don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise to anybody.\xc2\xa0 I think that so much of the turmoil that we saw in that community over the summer and fall were not the result of issues that had just cropped up; these were issues that were long-simmering and erupted in rather tragic ways into public view.</p>\n<p>And the Department of Justice, as you know, has been intensively involved in that local community, trying to work through some of those issues.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the work of this commission that the President has appointed will have some very practical, tangible recommendations for Ferguson and other communities all across the country, large and small, for some ideas about things they can do to try to head off these issues before they erupt so violently in the way that they did in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a second, unrelated question, you brought up Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra asked about Mitt Romney and you spoke very glowingly of him, saying he\xe2\x80\x99s a man of great faith and it was a difficult decision, things that you said.\xc2\xa0 And Jim asked -- brought up a really good point about inclusion.\xc2\xa0 During his run for President against President Obama, he was not known for inclusion efforts, and with that, what does this White House think of the crop of candidates running -- be it Democrat or Republican -- as it relates to inclusion and to include the issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing with Ferguson, what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in New York, in Sanford, Florida, with Travon Martin, and with Tamir Rice in Cleveland?\xc2\xa0 Does this administration feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility for these potential presidential candidates to really reach out for inclusion versus being a party for a single group of people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I think the best way for me to answer your question is to talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s experience.\xc2\xa0 And the President believed that the strength of his campaign was built on the diversity of the support that he enjoyed all across the country; that the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign had succeeded in energizing people who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been involved in politics before; that we got Democrats and Republicans and independents excited about the prospect of being able to change their country.</p>\n<p>And the President believes that ultimately, in 2008 and in 2012, that that was the key to his success.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that the campaigns that are run in 2016 are going to want to try to emulate successful -- recent, successful president campaigns, then a core element of those campaigns will need to be predicated on building a diverse, inclusive national campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a time that there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for just focusing on one group of people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that ultimately the people who will run in the 2016 campaigns are going to have to devise their own strategy.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that when the President devised his strategy in 2008 and 2012, that one of the most important elements of that strategy was building an inclusive campaign that reflected the kind of diverse support that he wanted to earn from voters and supporters all across the country.</p>\n<p>Francesca.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, speaking of people who might potentially be running for President, Joe Biden -- when he was at the Democratic conference, he said, to state the obvious, the past six years have been really, really hard for this country.\xc2\xa0 What was Vice President Biden trying to say there?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the past six years this President has been in charge of the country.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Francesca, I think what the Vice President was observing is that it\xe2\x80\x99s been very difficult to dig out of the financial crisis that this President inherited when he took office and that it has been hard work to dig out of that financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 And because of the grit and determination of the American people and American workers, because of the policies that this administration put in place, our economy has bounced back stronger than ever.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid a new foundation that we need to capitalize on, and the President is hopeful that on top of that new foundation, we can actually put in place policies that are going to benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s opening up the doors to a college education to more middle-class families; making it easier for middle-class families to save for retirement; helping middle-class families stretch a paycheck -- stretch their paychecks, particularly if both mom and dad are working.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of policies we can put in place that will be in the best interest of middle-class families and that\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity that we have now that we have recovered from a terrible financial crisis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re very clear, but on a related note, the Democrats are having a panel today called, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Do We Go From Here?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest that the rest of the Democratic Party, especially congressional democrats, are adrift and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the party is going?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for all the Democrats; I speak for just the most powerful Democrat in the world.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that he\xe2\x80\x99s very clear about where he wants to take the country.</p>\n<p>Ching-Yi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I have a question regarding the Asia Pacific, actually.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander, Admiral Robert Thomas, told Reuters that the U.S. would welcome Japan patrols in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 And the Chinese government has a reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 And China\xe2\x80\x99s English newspaper also reacts strongly by saying that Washington has no authority to draw Japan in, and also if Japan did send air patrols to South China Sea, China would counter that action and also announce to establish a South China Sea air defense zone.\xc2\xa0 So is this a new strategy for Obama administration to involve Japan\xe2\x80\x99s military into South China Sea?\xc2\xa0 And is there any change of your Asia rebalance policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ching-Yi, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific report that you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised, but I can tell you that the administration policy that we have sought to pursue is to make sure that disputes that are arising in the South China Sea are resolved peacefully; that the South China Sea is a zone of commerce that\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And ensuring that commerce can be conducted in that region of the world is in the clear interest of the largest economies in the world, including China, Japan and the United States.\xc2\xa0 So we all have an interest in making sure that those disputes are resolved peacefully and in a way that will allow commerce to continue unimpeded in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will the U.S. support Japan to air patrol in South China Sea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that specific prospect being raised but let me see if I can have my colleagues at the National Security Council get back to you on it.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Last night, one of the other messages from the President was DHS, Department of Homeland Security funding.\xc2\xa0 But what can Democrats do at this point, and have you heard anything new from Republicans on where that\xe2\x80\x99s headed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, unfortunately, we have not heard anything new from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, Republicans -- I guess this was yesterday that we discussed this previously -- the Republicans spent a lot of time trying to campaign so that they could have the majority in the House of Representatives and the majority in the United States Senate, and that they promised that they would show the country the kind of leadership that the Republican Party stands for.\xc2\xa0 But less than a month into this new era of Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress we see that Republicans are saying it\'s not that big of a deal if they don\xe2\x80\x99t fund the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that it\'s a pretty big deal to a border patrol officer.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be expected to show up to work, protect the country, but not get his paycheck for doing so.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is a pretty big deal for the President, that in a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with some pretty significant national security challenges, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not giving the Department of Homeland Security the flexibility and certainty that they need to carry out their mission because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a budget.</p>\n<p>So, again, if Republicans want to take some responsibility, as they said they did when they were running for the majority, we hope that they understand that a basic responsibility that they have is to protect the country, and to protect our homeland security, and to make sure that the agency that\xe2\x80\x99s charged with homeland security is properly funded.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, in the spirit of the President\xe2\x80\x99s repeated calls for raising taxes on the most well-off in America, will the President support legislation that would strip the NFL of its tax-exempt status?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Olivier, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that specific proposal but maybe after the President rolls out his budget we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then secondly and unrelated, over the last six years if you and I wanted to discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy in Afghanistan we\xe2\x80\x99d be able to draw on a wealth of data compiled by the Special Inspector General in charge of Afghan Reconstruction.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, if we wanted to discuss the recruitment training equipment of Afghan forces, we\xe2\x80\x99d be able to draw on data of how many people are in the field, what is their status, we can\xe2\x80\x99t anymore because -- with apparently this White House\xe2\x80\x99s blessing now the NATO command has classified information they used to make public.\xc2\xa0 Will the President reverse that decision?\xc2\xa0 And how are we supposed to hold this administration and this policy to account if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get this information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have to admit, Olivier, I\'m not aware of this specific issue, but we can take a look into it for you.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made it a priority to try to be more transparent and that has included trying to limit the over-classification -- there is a tendency to classify data in a way that ultimately upon further review isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not this is one of those situations, but we can take a look into it and get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech last night.\xc2\xa0 He said there is no economic metric by which we are not better off.\xc2\xa0 Now does he include the national debt in that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has noted is that when you evaluate the deficit, the deficit has actually fallen by two-thirds since he\xe2\x80\x99s taken office.\xc2\xa0 And the way that we measure that is the way that economists evaluate it.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t look at just the sum total; what they do is they evaluate the deficit as a percentage of the economy -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s a more effective and precise way to evaluate the impact of the deficit on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And by that measure, the deficit has been brought down by two-thirds since the President took office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the debt, which has gone up 70 percent on his watch?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the measure is of the debt as it relates to when you measure it as a percentage of the economy.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the President continues to be committed to the kinds of fiscally responsible policies that were important to getting our debt and deficit under control when the President first took office.\xc2\xa0 And that includes, as somebody mentioned a little earlier, raising taxes on those at the top so that we can offer some tax cuts to the middle class; that by closing loopholes and making our tax code a little bit more fair, we can also make it a little easier for middle-class families to make their ends meet, and we can do that in a way that does exacerbate the federal deficit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might he concede that the debt is not a metric that shows we\xe2\x80\x99re better off?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he would concede, as I would, that the raw math shows that the debt has increased.\xc2\xa0 But the steps that the President has taken have been important to improving our fiscal picture.</p>\n<p>Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday the Senate Armed Service Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for Ashton Carter as Defense Secretary.\xc2\xa0 LGBT advocates have been calling for two things that will be under his purview:\xc2\xa0 Openly transgender service and a non-discrimination rule for LGBT servicemembers.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee will address those things during the hearing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If asked, I\'m sure that he will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he volunteer this in some capacity do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of volunteering that goes on in those kinds of settings, I think usually they\xe2\x80\x99re asked questions -- and I\'m sure that he\xe2\x80\x99ll answer them if he\xe2\x80\x99s given the opportunity to do so.\xc2\xa0 So, one thing you could do is you could go and ask members of Congress if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other news, federal contractor Exxon Mobile today announced that it has adopted an LGBT inclusive non-discrimination policy for its workers.\xc2\xa0 This follows the executive order the President signed in July to prohibit LGBT discrimination among federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 Does the President deserve credit for this change?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was not aware of that news until you just informed me -- but I guess that is your profession.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is I do think this is an indication of something that we have talked about quite a bit, that there is -- that there are a number of ways that the President can advance the kind of agenda that he thinks is in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Sometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s by passing legislation that would apply broadly across the economy and across the country.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it\'s about the President taking action that applies only to the federal government and using that as a model for other businesses that are considering -- or other entities that are considering similar action.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this when it came to the minimum wage, that the President was able to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors, and that in conjunction with that, we saw that other states said that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a good idea in our states.\xc2\xa0 Or voters in other states said, we should raise the minimum wage in our states.</p>\n<p>So, there is a way for the President to use his executive authority in a way that may, at the beginning, have only a limited effect, but does serve to motivate and in some cases even inspire other states or other companies or other organizations to take similar steps.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the -- we\xe2\x80\x99re gratified by the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had when it comes to pushing other states to raise the minimum wage or states to expand access to quality early childhood education.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s possible, based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve described to me, that this may be an example of that as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to my first question because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really satisfied with that response.\xc2\xa0 Those two issues of openly transgender service and --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of that in this building it sometimes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\'s okay, it\'s part of my profession.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the LGBT non-discrimination policy.\xc2\xa0 Do you think those are two things that the Pentagon can implement either before or after confirmations?</p>\n<p>MR.
