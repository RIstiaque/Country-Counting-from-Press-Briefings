GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Settle down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, now what?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now we wait for everybody to take their seats, right?\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that what the -- shuffle in, shuffle in.\xc2\xa0 Paging Jake Tapper.\xc2\xa0 Paging Jake Tapper.\xc2\xa0 I know -- I know he\xe2\x80\x99s coming, but I might as well twist a little bit while we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting.</p>\n<p>Phil, why don\'t we go ahead while we wait for Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House wanted this bill passed so you guys could pivot back to jobs, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re going Thursday to Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Is pivoting to jobs still the plan?\xc2\xa0 And how long are we going to be talking about health care now that it\xe2\x80\x99s passed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take this a couple of different ways.\xc2\xa0 One, I think the President has been working on the economic recovery every day that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office.\xc2\xa0 We know that the President, in fact, signed a bill just last week to provide tax credits for small businesses that hire the unemployed and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to talk about that going forward.\xc2\xa0 We know there are aspects of small business lending -- zero capital gains for small business and the retrofit proposals that the President has made -- that he now wants to see also go through Congress.</p>\n<p>Thursday the President will visit Iowa City where he outlined a grassroots health care reform plan in 2007 and have a chance to talk about what this legislation means for the small businesses that I was talking about, for families with children who are labeled by insurance companies to suffer from a preexisting condition, or to talk about what this means for seniors who will finally get help with covering the cost of their prescription drugs if they happen to fall into what\xe2\x80\x99s commonly known as the doughnut hole in Medicare Part D.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be the one health care event he does outside of Washington, or are we going to be doing a series of events outside of Washington and barnstorm in support of this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has a very busy schedule coming up on a whole host of issues.\xc2\xa0 Phil, I assume the President will talk about health care for a long time, but the President has over the course of the past many weeks, even as the legislative agenda has been focused on getting health care done, which we did last night, the President also, I think as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see over the next couple of weeks, has been working on a number of other issues that are at the forefront and that we\'ll have an opportunity to talk about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, a lot of Democrats switched their votes or took politically dangerous votes for themselves, frankly, to support this bill.\xc2\xa0 What kind of support are those Democrats in the House going to be receiving from the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt -- and I don\'t have a political schedule in front of me -- I have no doubt that we\'ll be on the road extensively in the fall as it relates to health care reform and as it relates to helping those that supported health care last night and supporting Democrats, even some that didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did you mean to announce when the bill signing is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be sometime tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- they\xe2\x80\x99re still working out some of the logistics.\xc2\xa0 In terms of timing, I would plan as of right now for a late morning bill signing, weather permitting, outside, probably on the South Lawn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Definitely on campus, nothing --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As of the last sort of update I got, it would be logistically tough to go off campus but also if the weather doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cooperate, it might also be logistically difficult to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Invited?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think each and every member of the House and Senate that supported health care reform will be invited.\xc2\xa0 I expect that many of them will attend.\xc2\xa0 I also believe that the President will have with him many of the stories that he\xe2\x80\x99s given lift to over the course of the past year to help demonstrate exactly why the President did what he did for so long and who this impacts the most.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, one on health care and one on -- a foreign policy question.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the states that have threatened to sue over this legislation?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President and the team are taking seriously?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I heard Nancy-Ann talk a little bit about this, this morning on television I think.\xc2\xa0 My sense is that a lot of big pieces of legislation are challenged in some ways.\xc2\xa0 We certainly have -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the intent of some to do -- to challenge this legislation on grounds we don\xe2\x80\x99t think will be very successful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think their suits will be very successful?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is there any kind of a plan or a reaction to deal with that in the coming --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I assume there will be many things that we will deal with in the coming weeks, months, and years ahead as health care reform is implemented.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- you know, look, some of the states and some of the players might end up being kind of curious, but, again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s pretty long-standing precedent on the constitutionality of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question is on Google and China.\xc2\xa0 If Google does decide to pull out of China, what effect would that have on U.S.-Chinese relations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me not get ahead of something -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to maybe discuss that later on.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that you heard the President enunciate quite clearly in China a policy and a belief that open government and the ability to communicate among people without the censorship of government is tremendously important.</p>\n<p>So it may be, as there are in some issues, that we in a mature diplomatic relationship have disagreements.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of something, but we may have a chance to discuss that later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Google brief the administration on what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the latest is this morning on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday you guys are going to Iowa to -- the President is going to talk about health care reform, and I know you recall 2007 when the President -- then-senator was there; he introduced his health care proposal.\xc2\xa0 If you look at what he announced in 2007 and what is law or will be law as of tomorrow,\xc2\xa0 there are a lot of similarities, but there are also a lot of striking differences in terms of whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s universal coverage, whether or not every individual\xe2\x80\x99s family premiums will go down $2,500.\xc2\xa0 Is this just what happens when ideals meet the pragmatic politics?\xc2\xa0 Or why are there such differences between what the President proposed two years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Jake, obviously what you propose and what goes through the system sometimes change.\xc2\xa0 I think the promise that the President played out in May of 2007 and talked about even before laying out a specific policy was that we should not, in a country like the United States of America, have to have people deciding between keeping their house and keeping their health care; or we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in a country where people don\'t have access to affordable health care.</p>\n<p>So look, I think always in this, it always goes through the legislative process, but I think what the President promised that day and what the President will sign tomorrow -- very much the promise of affordable, accessible health care that puts people back in charge of their health care rather than insurance companies; I think something that will have lasting benefit for tens of millions of Americans for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a follow-up legislation, since the President had the goal of universal coverage in 2007?\xc2\xa0 And the CBO says that current legislation will leave uninsured 23 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a follow-up attempt?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any discussions about that this morning.\xc2\xa0 The coverage that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Probably not.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 The coverage -- I think CBO said somewhere between 94 and 95 percent of Americans will have coverage.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we will, after the President signs this into law, get about to the important process of ensuring its efficient and speedy implementation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel any -- this, obviously, was a very long, hard fight; very bitter and divisive in a lot of ways -- does the President feel any obligation, as a man who campaigned on bridging the partisan divide, to reach out to Republicans for future legislation, for improving the spirit in Washington that has now been so poisoned by this very vicious debate at times?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to look back and see whether the debate itself poisoned the atmosphere.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President will do on financial reform, on campaign finance, on getting our economy moving again, all of the host of issues that -- immigration reform and energy -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about still being on the docket, I think the President will continue to reach out to Democrats and Republicans that want to make a positive effort on these issues.</p>\n<p>Jake, the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99m a little struck by the fact that everybody seems on one side to be talking about repeal today.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them answer why, as Mitch McConnell put it in his profile in the New York Times, the anecdote of him having a plan even before the President came to the Congress with an economic recovery plan last January, that he had a plan to simply say no to each and everything that the President proposed.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a little bit about what elections are ultimately going to be about.</p>\n<p>And I think if people want to campaign on taking tax cuts away from small businesses, taking assistance away from seniors getting prescription drugs, and want to take away a mother knowing that their child can\'t be discriminated against by an insurance company -- if that\'s the platform that others want to run on, taking that away from families and small businesses, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a robust campaign on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to some of the words that were thrown around just this past weekend?\xc2\xa0 One Republican member of Congress shouting \xe2\x80\x9cbaby killer.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You had Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights icon, have the N-word shouted at him.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that, first; but then how do you pick up the pieces from this debate for immigration and closing Gitmo and some of those other things?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, you have -- we have talked about on any number of different debates what happens when people say things that have no place in a legislative debate, let alone any -- I think any real place in our public or, quite frankly, even private discourse.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I would want to explain to my six year old why I had done or said some of the things that were done or said this past weekend.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes regardless of the passion of your views, which people rightly hold in a country as great as this, that we ought to be able to have that debate without the type of language and actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in some places over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on Jake was asking about the speech in the campaign about covering all Americans, regardless of whether there was any talk this morning about a second piece of legislation, generally how do you view this?\xc2\xa0 Is this the first bite of the apple?\xc2\xa0 Does the President hope to complete this by the end of 2012?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you all constructing another mountain for us to climb.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m quite frankly this afternoon just enjoying the view from where we are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On another subject, Israel, you got the Prime Minister coming to meet with the President tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Ahead of that meeting we\xe2\x80\x99re getting reports that the Prime Minister has suggested he might make some concessions, including sitting down for direct talks with the Palestinians, U.S.-brokered.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like we need to hear whether the U.S. is willing to bring the parties together.\xc2\xa0 How quickly do you think the President will receive those concessions and would he commence talks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Prime Minister Netanyahu is -- obviously is here, will meet with some administration officials today, and will meet privately with the President, like he did last year, tomorrow, early tomorrow evening.\xc2\xa0 Our goal in any of this is to create an atmosphere of trust and open dialogue to bring these two sides together so that the discussions can be substantive in moving towards comprehensive Middle Eastern peace.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what we hope tomorrow is in his discussions with the Prime Minister, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what comes out of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President prepared to start talks with the U.S. helping to broker --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to having a good conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we go from there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No coverage.\xc2\xa0 It will be in the dining room off the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did the President learn about himself out of this debate and about the different parties?\xc2\xa0 And what is -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very legitimate to ask what is the next big mountain?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate to ask.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to climb a separate mountain on this.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what he learned about -- I think what all of Washington learned about him is that he is willing to make very tough decisions --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he go for the government plan then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get five words out, Helen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make very tough decisions and see that through.\xc2\xa0 I think there were many opportunities where he could have turned back, and I think he -- I think very much that what passed last night meant more to him than any election night could have, because I think he understands -- and the reason that he continued to push forward on something as important as health care reform is he understands just what it will mean, as I said earlier, for millions of Americans for many, many years to come.</p>\n<p>They will -- just in the next -- within this year, small businesses will begin to get tax credits to help pay for the coverage they provide their employees.\xc2\xa0 Seniors will get help in their prescription drug coverage, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to close that doughnut hole that I talked about.\xc2\xa0 Maybe most importantly in all these immediate benefits, like I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, a mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have -- won\xe2\x80\x99t have to sit in her kitchen on the phone with an insurance company, worried sick that the decisions about her child\xe2\x80\x99s health care are not going to be made by a doctor, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be made by her or her family, but by an insurance company bureaucrat on the other end of the phone in God knows where, determining that that child had a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all going to change.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen over the course of the rest of 2010.</p>\n<p>So, look, I think he was -- I think he knew what he wanted to accomplish, and despite all of -- despite whatever he was told, he kept fighting for what he believed in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will that be his modus operandi from now on?\xc2\xa0 He started out very slow and not really pushing --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say perseverance paid off.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President rightly looks at the scorekeeping that happens on any given or individual day.\xc2\xa0 And I doubt that anybody -- I doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s not anybody in here that at some point declared health care dead, maybe multiple times.\xc2\xa0 I think the pace that the President had was to see the long view and to get this done, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he did.</p>\n<p>As for the next mountains, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about some of them.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that finishing the legislation that the President has offered and ideas that he\xe2\x80\x99s offered on getting our economy moving again, small business lending, zero capital gains for start-up small businesses, the retrofitting initiatives to, again, create jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the outstanding case -- and the loophole that the case generated for Citizens United; obviously, financial reform, which Senator Dodd\xe2\x80\x99s committee will take up today, and I think we feel there\xe2\x80\x99s some momentum building for seeing that through, as well as big issues like comprehensive energy and immigration legislation are obviously still left for the President to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some who think -- who seem to think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform bill will somehow fund abortions.\xc2\xa0 Can you maybe speak to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say that again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some who think the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform is somehow funding abortions.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, and I think the executive order makes this clear:\xc2\xa0 The President stated throughout this process that health care reform should simply maintain the status quo.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the bill maintains the status quo and he thinks the executive order reiterates that strong belief.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s all it does, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it -- reiterates the existing law?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in particular about the executive order that changed anything.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President and I think quite frankly many in Congress on both sides of this believed, as the President did, that this should be a health care bill; that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bill about other issues.\xc2\xa0 And what the bill does and what the executive order does is underscore that the status quo is preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change anything, though, does it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was the whole point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So tomorrow, will there be -- will the President have any new proposals to move the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations beyond where they are with the Mitchell talks right now?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to -- any new ideas to push this forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a sense of what they discussed in the meeting after the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is rightly focused on building the type of trust that\'s needed to get two parties back at the table to begin that dialogue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he expect a further apology for the treatment of the Vice President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve spoken clearly on that and I have no doubt that that will be a topic in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow quickly on the Middle East -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s no coverage, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be no public statement with the President appearing --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the second time in a row that Prime Minister Netanyahu has visited and you guys have not had any cameras.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- is this just a coincidence?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think over the course of -- this will be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the only world leader and now it\xe2\x80\x99s twice?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- well, I don\'t -- you may have better -- Mark probably has better statistics on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did I do on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, King Juan Carlos, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a picture of him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There you go.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What do you have to say about that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>I think this is the fourth meeting, if I\'m not mistaken, with Prime Minister Netanyahu -- two were open with sprays, two have been --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the second straight visit to the White House, though, with no public statements.\xc2\xa0 Not a coincidence, or it is a coincidence?\xc2\xa0 Is there --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you want to play it down?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a helpful thing to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You guys seem to be let in on a secret that the meeting is happening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secret?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they both want to reassure the world that relations are not frayed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We said that a week ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but why won\'t they go public -- the leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that -- I can tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99re not frayed and that our bond with the Israelis is strong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is how an ally -- so an ally comes and visits, no picture, no back-slapping, hey -- relations with the Associated Press are great between -- I know, I mean -- it does seem odd --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You lost me in that otherwise pretty good analogy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it just seems odd -- no, that you guys have -- this is an important ally.\xc2\xa0 You say relations aren\xe2\x80\x99t frayed.\xc2\xa0 So why not come out together and say that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is how the coverage of the meeting is going to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to health care; I want to follow upon the legal challenge question.\xc2\xa0 What has your Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office said?\xc2\xa0 Why do you have this confidence that -- you say there\xe2\x80\x99s established law, established precedent.\xc2\xa0 On what, what is it?\xc2\xa0 What is the established precedent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On regulation of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how is a mandate on an individual part of interstate -- I mean, so --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s -- I think, again -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And neither am I.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, so we\xe2\x80\x99re both in a pool where we can\xe2\x80\x99t either see or touch the bottom.\xc2\xa0 But as I understand the articles that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, the Attorney General, for instance, of Virginia, is going to sue because he thinks this violates that.\xc2\xa0 I think that for many decades, the Supreme Court has recognized Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the commerce clause to regulate activities relating to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is essentially going to say -- the argument is going to be, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a human being and an American citizen, you have to get health insurance.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re challenging the basis -- the constitutional basis of an individual responsibility requirement that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a federal level, as opposed to a --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- right -- that the President and the team do not believe.\xc2\xa0 For instance, I think Utah is one of the states that\'s thinking about doing this.\xc2\xa0 Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett have both been on legislation requiring some level of individual responsibility like this.\xc2\xa0 Senator Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s health care bill with Senator Wyden has an individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 So again, I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into why some of this stuff --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that speaks to an advocacy question, not to the legal basis of it.\xc2\xa0 They could advocate for it, and it could be wrong legally, too.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not making a judgment on their policy points --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll let you ask Senator Hatch whether he thinks that he regularly believes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your advice from Counsel is there is no legal basis on which the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My advice from Counsel is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll win these lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, confidence on this -- on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen this week in the Senate?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got your 51 votes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got them lined up, this is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that -- look, I would point you to what Senator Reid told the House caucus on Saturday; that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He seemed to hedge a little bit.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, there was no letter, 51, right, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a full-fledged, or the 51 signatures.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt Senator Reid would have to -- if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the commitment that he told many he would have and we believe he does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You expect the Senate to pass this word for word, what they passed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the Senate will take this up at some point this week, begin the process, and, look, health care is going to become law tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to all of the amendments or all of the shenanigans that will be tried on Capitol Hill over the course of the next many days, but we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that this process is coming to an end.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back onto abortion, there are some who believe that given the difficultly of complying with this separation of funds and the rules that are laid out, that a lot of insurance companies just simply won\xe2\x80\x99t offer abortion coverage in the exchange.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view on the likelihood of that outcome?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to Nancy-Ann about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s a topic that they have wrestled with.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s -- once the President signs this into law, there will be a host of implementation ideas and tasks that we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin working on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the broader question, the President entered office determined to sort of try to bridge the gap in the abortion wars and repeatedly has issued statements trying to bring the sides together, and yet it seems as though the abortion wars are as hot as they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 I think if they were as hot as they\xe2\x80\x99d ever been, we\xe2\x80\x99d be talking about why this was an issue that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t central to the legislation but it caused its demise.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we\xe2\x80\x99re here because groups worked together in order to ensure that a health care bill would be a health care bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think that the abortion debate has become less toxic over the last year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, as it relates to health care, it\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced that the issue is one that even those that disagree on can find common ground to ensure that important policies like comprehensive health care reform move forward.</p>\n<p>Yes, Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, will the President sign the executive order tomorrow, as well?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told he can\xe2\x80\x99t sign that until he signs the law, so whether that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow or in the coming days.\xc2\xa0 Bill handed me a note that said, likely because of the weather we are going to be over at the Department of the Interior tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you logistical information on all that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reason for the Department of Interior?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think largely because of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Space?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- space.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the trip on Thursday, is that a victory lap or is he trying to reach out to perhaps Americans that are upset about the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, Mark, he will take the opportunity to discuss the benefits that the law provides millions of Americans as a result of his signature.\xc2\xa0 We can debate the polling and the politics on this.\xc2\xa0 I think that as -- as we get away from the back and forth of a legislative floor debate and examine what is in the bill and how it affects families and small businesses and seniors -- and then we can talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s not in the bill, despite what some people have said -- I think the President believes that more will -- more will see the benefits that he saw in making sure this legislation becomes law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he want to try to allay the fears or concerns of those who are opposed to the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he will -- I think he will walk -- in all that he does, he\xe2\x80\x99ll walk people through what he believes this legislation does.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say over the past many months to address specific instances about what people say the bill does that it in fact doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do.</p>\n<p>So I think he will have and continue to have an opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the first -- I anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99ll do a lot of that tomorrow; he did some of that last night; and will do even more of it in Iowa City.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have any comment that the vote yesterday for the bill was entirely partisan, but the vote against it was bipartisan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I remember anything specifically on that, Mark.\xc2\xa0 I know that, again, this is a President that has -- I think by any account you could see that this is a process that took a little more than a year to complete partly because the process that the President and Congress went through was one in order to try to get Republican support, even when Republicans said even it\xe2\x80\x99s likely if -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that I can support -- I like what\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill, I might not be able to vote for it.\xc2\xa0 I think that just is the -- regrettably the times that apparently we live in.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, since the briefing started Google has now announced that it won\xe2\x80\x99t censor searches in China and is directing users to the Hong Kong servers.\xc2\xa0 Now, can you talk about how the U.S. was informed --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I know that there were some -- I need to find out what discussions were had here this morning.\xc2\xa0 I know there was some discussion over the weekend that something like this might be coming.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With NSC?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With NSC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And do you know what action the U.S. might take if China\xe2\x80\x99s government makes any move against Google\xe2\x80\x99s operations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I would get into a hypothetical on something like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to react to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, not what we think might.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the talks tomorrow night, will the President be in kind of a listen mode, trying to understand the housing stuff last week, or is he going to offer up some proposal, some sort of way forward?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not under the impression the President is bringing new proposals forward.\xc2\xa0 I think what we need to do is work to get and build the type of relationship between these two parties that allows them to get to the table and trust each other enough to have conversations.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s intention has been, quite honestly, since the beginning of his administration in trying to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he ask them for specific requests?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into what has been discussed with the Secretary of State or the Vice President over the past many days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about a readout?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have one, yes.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a little bit of texture on yesterday.\xc2\xa0 When was it that the President knew confidently that he had the votes -- Democratic leadership had the votes in the House?\xc2\xa0 Was it the final resolution, the Stupak situation?\xc2\xa0 Was it sometime after that?\xc2\xa0 And can you take us a little bit into the Roosevelt Room for what I have to imagine was a more than mildly significant moment for him personally and for those closest to him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- in terms of votes, I think obviously the members that Congressman Stupak had -- that shared his concerns, once the executive order -- once that all played out, I think obviously that\'s the point in which we felt good that the legislation would exceed 216 votes.\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you doubt up until that moment whether you could get 216 without that arrangement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were trying -- the President spent a lot of time talking to a lot of different members, discussing the benefits of what this legislation did, in a lot of different combinations, to get to 216.\xc2\xa0 So -- in terms of the Roosevelt --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question is, could you have gotten there without Stupak?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that would -- is altogether knowable, since at a certain point yesterday it became that way.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know what that -- I don\'t know what that does to other people\xe2\x80\x99s votes, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\'s altogether knowable.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Roosevelt Room, Major, he walked in, the Vice President was there, many staffers were there, and I think he very much wanted to -- he\xe2\x80\x99d come down from the residence and very much wanted to be, as we wanted to be with him, be with a group of people that have spent many years, some people far longer than coming here, working on the promise of health care reform for millions and millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>So as you always do, you anxiously watch, you wonder who the 24 people are that haven\xe2\x80\x99t voted, with two-and-a-half minutes left, given the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s been what everybody\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about for weeks.\xc2\xa0 And then obviously when we hit 216, there was a lot of jubilation.\xc2\xa0 The President went around the room, shaking hands and hugging and high-fiving.</p>\n<p>As I said, there are people that have worked on this issue longer than there has been an Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 There are people that have been with the President for many years throughout the campaign, like myself, I think that felt enormously proud of him for the type of perseverance I talked about earlier and not letting up and not giving up, and making sure that we drove toward what he saw as the outcome rather than listening to all of the noise in getting there.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, one of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any memorable quotes from that particular moment, either way, staff or President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just remember him being very happy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, when he walked around the room, I think we all had a chance to say stuff to him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was Mrs. Obama there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, she was not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of Iowa, Charles Grassley just said a moment ago that he would like to offer an amendment during the reconciliation process to require the President -- and all senior staff and all Cabinet secretaries -- to live under the guidelines and the requirements of the health care bill.\xc2\xa0 First of all, do you stipulate that they do not?\xc2\xa0 And second of all, do you consider that a flaw in the legislation and a legitimate point of criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look at the amendment and ask Nancy-Ann.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I think someone offered an amendment at some point in the process to make members of Congress, as the President has said, give the American people the same type of health care that members of Congress have.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, the President supported that.\xc2\xa0 I just have not seen what Senator Grassley --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on another topic.\xc2\xa0 Peter Orszag put out a memo last week on ACORN funding.\xc2\xa0 Do you consider that just a response to the federal court order to reinstate that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some information from OMB on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the -- what kind of event is it in Iowa?\xc2\xa0 A\xc2\xa0 speech, a town hall?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It will be a speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu resolve their differences, what\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s message to the Palestinians?\xc2\xa0 After the administration called on the Israeli government to stop building in East Jerusalem, they said they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get at the Palestinian concerns at all.\xc2\xa0 And it seems now that this is dissolving, but there is no real solution in their view.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President is hopeful that we will in this meeting make progress and get -- without getting into the intricacies of it -- get these two parties back to -- not just back physically to talks, but to the type of relationship that is necessary for those talks to bear fruit.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 First, on the passage of the health care reform bill, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about the effect this is going to have on Democrats in November.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans -- I think Karl Rove said it was going to be devastating to Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Most of the reporters I\'ve heard on TV since -- even since the passage of the bill seem to be conceding it\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- Democrats are going to pay some price.\xc2\xa0 Is there any scenario that you or the President sees whereby Democrats could actually gain in November based on the momentum from this legislative victory?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m not going to hazard a lot of guesses on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen eight months from now, since eight months from -- eight months backwards from today I don\'t think many people thought today we\xe2\x80\x99d be talking about what we\'ve accomplished in those eight months.\xc2\xa0 So I tend not to have a crystal ball.</p>\n<p>Again, I think that as -- when the President signs this landmark legislation the American people will, in the next several months, begin to feel -- through small business tax credits, through protections against children being declared -- or having declared that they have a preexisting condition, seniors getting help with their prescription drugs -- the type of things that the President envisioned happening as a part of health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And I think that will be beneficial.</p>\n<p>The President I think was pretty eloquent in saying this over the past couple weeks, that when asked what happens if this fails, what does it mean for you politically, I think the President was pretty clear in saying that his far greater concern was what happens to all of those that are depending on us to change the status quo, and to do so in a way that helps them.</p>\n<p>So I know there are a lot of folks that will want to prognosticate.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong belief is you make the decisions that you believe are right.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t spend a lot of time looking at the polls or listening to the chatter, and good decisions and good policy often tend to make for good politics in the long term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question was, there\xe2\x80\x99s also been some talk on the left about how any Democratic senator could sponsor an amendment to put a public option in the reconciliation package.\xc2\xa0 If that happened, would that be something the President would push for?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to wait for the Senate to decide what they want to do in terms of amendments.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can we go back to Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question and ask if -- in the obverse, about bipartisanship?\xc2\xa0 The President endured months of negotiation in the Senate while his allies tried to get some Republicans on board.\xc2\xa0 He went through town halls and meetings at Blair House, et cetera, and ended up with zero Republican votes.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the lesson of this that bipartisanship is a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, if your -- if the strategy on the other side is regardless of what the President proposes, to say no, then bipartisanship is going to be difficult.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people to say -- people have said today, well, what this whole process means, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to work together with the other side for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Well, I don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a real change in their schedule because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a whole lot of, gee, I know the economy is experiencing the worst downturn since the Great Depression, here are some ideas, let\xe2\x80\x99s help.</p>\n<p>I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- but again, I think the American people will judge whether or not people are doing what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing because they\xe2\x80\x99re just continuing the type of games that the American people hate in this town versus somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s trying to honestly make some progress.\xc2\xa0 I think the President spent seven or so hours at the Blair House.\xc2\xa0 Incorporated in the legislation were more than a hundred Republican amendments.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them what it would take to get their support when, as the President has himself said, bipartisanship can\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cnone of my ideas and all of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Incorporated in the legislation were Republican ideas.\xc2\xa0 People like Bob Dole and Howard Baker had proposals with Tom Daschle, very similar to what is proposed here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the fact that this legislation looks an awful lot like what happened in Massachusetts, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Governor Romney hates every time I say that.\xc2\xa0 The only difference really is that we addressed cost, and Massachusetts didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, and it took them a while to get to that curve.</p>\n<p>But what makes Republicans that two or four or eight or 12 years ago would have proposed something very similar to this now walk away from it is a good thing for them to have to answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, my question was about what the President takes from this.\xc2\xa0 Is he still willing to do the same sort of -- going for a year, for example, on financial overhaul?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think the President believes -- well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been working a year on financial reform.\xc2\xa0 We passed the House.\xc2\xa0 We are likely to pass soon the committee of jurisdiction in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes that we are coming close to the two-year anniversary of the utter collapse of our financial system based on people gaming that system and there not being in place strong rules to prevent that from happening.</p>\n<p>The President is not convinced that it is going to take another year to get those rules into place.\xc2\xa0 And people are going to have to decide in the next few months, particularly on financial reform, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re going to put rules in place to prevent this from happening, or whether you\xe2\x80\x99re going to work on the side of the very same actors that caused many of these types of episodes -- this type of episode, calamitous episode, to happen.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care a communications challenge different than Iowa City and beyond than it was in Missouri or Pennsylvania or Ohio before the bill was passed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have a different message now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously, look, I think the President will now discuss -- look, obviously, up until yesterday we were discussing what happens when the bill passes.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to talk about tangibly what people will see.</p>\n<p>So in some ways it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, obviously, some of the verbs are a little different, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the basis by what the President -- I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about for the past two weeks about what insurance companies are doing and what this reform does will be the basis for what I think a lot of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear going forward.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just on some of the other issues on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, do you have a ranking of the most important things and the most gettable things you want, or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I picked Kansas to win the bracket, so I don\'t see any reason for me to begin ranking said priorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How will you decide what to go for and what to really invest in --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- financial reform or energy or education?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that -- well, on education I think the President and Secretary Duncan have made amazing strides on reforming our educational system.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that financial reform is something the President expects to sign before the end of this year.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You talked a little bit earlier about the tone of the debate, but from the members of Congress -- not just from people outside the hall -- there was some very excessive rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 Connie Mack, representative from Florida, Republican, said -- put out a press release, saying literally, \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom died today.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 If that\'s sort of the response you got from the other side, first, you know, what do you make of it, and can you work with people like that in other areas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, all the President can do is try.\xc2\xa0 All the President can do is talk to members about what is important going forward, and getting our economy moving again -- is it helping small businesses with tax credits and lending and things like that.\xc2\xa0 I happen to believe there is some overlap and commonality, at least in the rhetoric of what President Obama and some on the Republican side talk about.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not -- again, whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to put aside Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s plan to oppose everything and seek to be part of a governing solution, we\'ll just have to see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a related front, looking back at what happened with the stimulus and the political debate that followed for months afterwards, do you believe the White House has picked up any lessons on how to deal with the definitional debate that will come about after the passage of this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think, as is the case with the Recovery Plan, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt, as I said early on in my time here today, that the President will -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt the President will continue to talk about what health care reform is for the American people, what the passage of this law means.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, I think people will also get a chance to see what some people have said the bill means -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll get to see that\'s not what\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 And I think all of that will be beneficial for folks over the next many months.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on a second.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House ready for the implementation challenge that will come after the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature?\xc2\xa0 There are a number of positions at HHS, for instance, that are still vacant and will have a big role here.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I know that senior staff here this morning in our morning meeting as well as in our meeting with the President discussed beginning in earnest that process and what goes along with it -- undoubtedly a big challenge.\xc2\xa0 But I think many of the same group of people that helped think -- helped get through Congress what many people thought was unattainable will begin the challenge of implementing what will be law on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Glen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, it was really kind of a circus-like atmosphere in the House chamber at times yesterday.\xc2\xa0 In addition to sort of the Neugebauer-Stupak issue, there were fliers placed on seats.\xc2\xa0 There was one incident in which some -- there was an outburst in the gallery and some members on the Republican side seemed to encourage that outburst.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the GOP leadership in the House is doing enough to rein in its own members and to instill a sense of decorum about the House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I was in and out of a lot of things yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I did not see each and every instance.\xc2\xa0 I have said here and I think many have said that we have to be respectful of each other despite the differences that we may have in our opinions and to conduct ourselves in a way that demonstrates that respect.\xc2\xa0 I think that goes for anybody in public life on both sides of the aisle as -- even as you\xe2\x80\x99re debating something that has inflamed the passions like health care reform certainly has.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it says something, though, about the party and where they\xe2\x80\x99re at, at the moment, that you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing this kind of behavior?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think instead of being frustrated about a process, there were many avenues with which to become active in the legislative problem-solving part of the process that I think many wish they might have taken up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do the insurance -- are the insurance companies going to be expected to comply with the measures in the law from the moment the President signs them?\xc2\xa0 In other words, you talked about kids and preexisting conditions -- will people notice that immediately on day one in talking to their insurance companies?\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t there have to be regulations -- aren\xe2\x80\x99t we really actually talking about many months before that actually goes into effect, or do you expect that they comply in the spirit from day one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me ask -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a good policy question for me to ask Nancy Ann.\xc2\xa0 The legislation on the three things that I discussed phases that in over the course of the remaining part of this year.\xc2\xa0 The spirit of the law is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve not talked to her about, but I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s a question worth asking.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Clinton, on Saturday night, said that he was making calls to Democratic members of the House at the behest the White House, and then took a call from President Obama about 7:00-7:15 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the role he played and what you asked him to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, President Clinton has relationships with many members of Congress on the Democratic side going back to his time here.\xc2\xa0 And we made use of his offering to do whatever he could to help pass this legislation.\xc2\xa0 He asked for calls.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Rahm knows who the President -- President Clinton knows well.\xc2\xa0 And we handed him members to reach out to.\xc2\xa0 And I think, in the end, he was successful in helping us get some of those votes.</p>\n<p>I will say this, too.\xc2\xa0 Prior to coming out here, I was in a meeting in the Situation Room where Secretary Clinton was, and she was very happy to see what happened yesterday, and when the President came in, walked over and gave him a big hug for what had been accomplished.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:46 P.M.
