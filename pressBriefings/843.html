CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for coming aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Toledo.\xc2\xa0 I just have one brief update to give you, which is that tomorrow, when the President goes to Louisiana, he will receive a briefing.\xc2\xa0 He will also tour flood damage caused by Hurricane Isaac in St. John the Baptist Parish with local and federal officials.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver a statement that evening, tomorrow evening, from that parish and then return to Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to -- I know we were having a discussion yesterday about early voting and voting by mail, and I came back to you guys with just a couple of interesting statistics for this.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday, an early voter or vote by mail to us is the same is as a vote on Election Day; the one is not more valuable than the other.\xc2\xa0 And we have a grassroots-on-the-ground focus in every state on these programs in making sure people know when they can vote, how to vote, et cetera.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we were just in Colorado.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned yesterday -- I said 77 percent; it was actually 78 percent of people early voted or voted by mail.\xc2\xa0 We\'re headed to Ohio -- 26 percent in 2008 early voted or voted by mail.\xc2\xa0 We were just in Iowa -- 36 percent early voted or voted by mail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The early vote -- the days that early vote starts in these states range, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to send this to all of you.\xc2\xa0 They begin as early as September 27th in Iowa, October 2nd in Ohio, October 22nd in Colorado.\xc2\xa0 But again, this is a big focus, and we\'ll be continuing to communicate with people in these states about how and when they can vote.\xc2\xa0 So with that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Questions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the name of the parish?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 St. John the Baptist.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so this is in the evening?\xc2\xa0 It carries into the evening?\xc2\xa0 I just didn\'t hear you very well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have exact timing.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s in -- I don\'t have a time of day, but the statement, which will be at the end of his visit, will be in the evening.\xc2\xa0 But we get back fairly late in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be meeting with any local residents, or is it more like getting briefing from officials?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more details for you on it.\xc2\xa0 Those are the contours of his visit that I can provide to you at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify what you mean by "statement"?\xc2\xa0 Will he be speaking to reporters, speaking directly to the camera?\xc2\xa0 How --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, just statement to the pool.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s when you\'ll hear from him.\xc2\xa0 Just a statement to the pool, not for broadcast or anything.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what the President is doing to get ready for the convention through tomorrow and as it starts on Tuesday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jen and I can both do that.\xc2\xa0 He is focused primarily on the events that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him participate in so far on this trip in Iowa and Colorado, and looking forward to being in Toledo.\xc2\xa0 But as we mentioned, he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on his speech.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to the opportunity to speak in Charlotte on Thursday evening.\xc2\xa0 That\'s pretty much been the focus of his work.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add, for the President, this is not -- and for us as a party, this is not a reinvention convention like the Republican Convention was last week.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very consistent about laying out the choice the American people are facing.\xc2\xa0 This will bring it more into focus.\xc2\xa0 We know that the convention is a huge platform with a big megaphone, and there is no question that next Friday, when the American people look back, they\'re going to know what the choice is, they\'re going to know what his forward-looking agenda is.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking forward to Thursday night.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll also add that in addition to the President, there are of course a number of other speakers, as you know, at the convention.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the fact that the First Lady will be speaking on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will be speaking on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re important bookends for this convention as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will be laying out a very personal view of the President\'s vision, the President -- what keeps him up at night, what keeps him going, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.\xc2\xa0 And the Vice President has had a front seat to the last three and a half years.\xc2\xa0 He knows firsthand how challenging the times have been, how hard the decisions have been.\xc2\xa0 And you should expect to hear more from him on that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, on the convention, the President keeps ripping Mitt Romney for not introducing a single new idea.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he\xe2\x80\x99s going to present new ideas, stuff that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t talked about before?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has been running on his forward-looking agenda for the entire time he\xe2\x80\x99s been campaigning.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about his forward-looking agenda for the last three and a half years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been running on our ideas.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been running on his ideas -- whether that is talking about more we can do for students to help them go to college, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and what people can look ahead to, or whether that is the ideas he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out -- doing more to invest in infrastructure, doing more to help small businesses grow and prosper.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unlike the President, Mitt Romney and the Republicans have been running away from their ideas.\xc2\xa0 And when you have a lack of ideas -- their pool is like an empty pool with no water and dead leaves and trees in it.\xc2\xa0 So when you have that to go back to, of course you\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend your time launching petty attacks.\xc2\xa0 And I think you will hear a lot more from him on his forward-looking agenda than you heard from Mitt Romney on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted you to comment on the empty pool of water and dead leaves and trees.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I endorse language as creative and descriptive as that used by my friend and colleague.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday and again today talked about bringing all the troops home from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 But the plan that he had put forth when he went to Afghanistan in May didn\xe2\x80\x99t lay that specific date down.\xc2\xa0 Is this a new plan from the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware, this is a NATO-endorsed strategy that foresees full transition to Afghan security lead in Afghanistan by 2014.\xc2\xa0 That is a NATO policy that has been put in place for quite some time now.\xc2\xa0 And part of that is drawing down our forces, which, as you know, is happening as we speak.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that all the troops will be out by 2014 as he said?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He never said that all the troops would be out.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as we did in Iraq -- and I think this is a good way to look at it -- is in Iraq, there were steps of -- sort of milestones where troops began to come home, more and more authorities transferred over to Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. forces that remained as that process took place moved out of the cities and on to bases.\xc2\xa0 And then the full transfer took place and combat mission ended, after which remaining U.S. forces eventually came home and the last U.S. soldier left, with the exception obviously of those who are at the embassy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What he said was, the specific plan to bring our troops home by the end of 2014, which it sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to engage in a clever game of \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Everyone understands what the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is, which is a full transition to Afghan security lead by 2014.\xc2\xa0 We have been abundantly clear about the stages of the implementation of that policy.\xc2\xa0 And as in Iraq, that means that while not all U.S. troops will have withdrawn necessarily by then, the Afghan Security Forces will be in full security transition -- I mean, will be in full security lead, and U.S. forces will continue to be drawn down.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the White House have any comment to Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s remarks -- I think it was yesterday -- about the international community not presenting a clear red line on Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kathleen, I appreciate that question, and I can tell you that there is absolutely no daylight between the United States and Israel when it comes to the necessity of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President has been engaged in a policy that has put enormous pressure on the regime in Tehran, isolated it and sanctioned it to a degree that is unprecedented, and why he has made clear that in pursuit of the objective of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, all options remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two, it is the case that the window for diplomacy remains open, and it remains the case that the best way to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon is through a diplomatic process that results in Iran finally agreeing to, in a completely verifiable way, give up its nuclear weapons ambitions and abide by its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 But that window will not remain open indefinitely, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, the President has insisted that all options, in pursuit of his policy objective, remain on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any concerns that with statements like that, Netanyahu is raising tensions in a counterproductive way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that we share absolutely the same objective as the Israelis, that there is no daylight between us when it comes to our commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and that the onus here is entirely on Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing that I think everyone here who has been covering these issues for the past four years has seen clearly is a change in the way the world views this problem.\xc2\xa0 When President Obama was running for this office, and when he took this office in January of 2009, the world was divided over this issue of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions, and Iran was united.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy and the pursuit of it, the world has united and come to a consensus that is unprecedented, in agreement that Iran is the problem; that it is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s failure to live up to its international obligations that has caused this situation that is of such serious concern to President Obama, obviously to Prime Minister Netanyahu, and to leaders around the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it is a testament to the vision that the President had when he when he ran for the office, that he understood the value in uniting the international community behind a plan of action that has isolated Iran, put enormous financial stress and political pressure on Iran as we pursue this goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell last week endorsed the Washington Nationals plan to shut down Stephen Strasburg despite them being in a pennant race.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share the Senate Minority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s view that the team should shut down their best pitcher?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have had this discussion with him, although not this week.\xc2\xa0 As I think he\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned, he\xe2\x80\x99s following the Nationals closely.\xc2\xa0 He is, first and foremost, a diehard Chicago White Sox fan, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 But I think he has, like all of us in Washington, been caught up in the remarkable success of the Washington Nationals this season.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a firm opinion to state for you about whether -- from the President about whether or not Stephen Strasburg should be shut down, as you say.\xc2\xa0 But he --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have an opinion?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But he certainly appreciates the conundrum that Nationals management faces as well as Nationals fans, including myself.\xc2\xa0 He pitched a great game today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw that.\xc2\xa0 Six solid innings.\xc2\xa0 I think one run.\xc2\xa0 Pretty good.\xc2\xa0 Nats won 4-3, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tTake care.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 4:23 P.M.
