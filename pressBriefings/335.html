Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:55 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see all of you.\xc2\xa0 For those of you who are paying close attention to my personal schedule today, you know that I went and appeared at a forum with the Center of American Progress to talk about men and fathers and work-life family balance.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m much less nervous sitting here talking to you about a range of foreign policy issues, and even some domestic ones, than I am talking about my personal life with my wife and child in the front row.\xc2\xa0 So for one day I can at least walk in here and say I\xe2\x80\x99m relieved to see all of you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did you do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You should ask my wife.\xc2\xa0 She may have a more unbiased assessment.</p>\n<p>Julie, you want to get us started today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I had a couple questions on Islamic State and Jordan.\xc2\xa0 Congressional lawmakers are calling for increased military assistance to Jordan, including weapons.\xc2\xa0 Would the President support that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, we do have a very powerful and important counterterrorism and security relationship with the nation of Jordan, and that relationship has significantly benefitted American national security interests throughout the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 We have also found that Jordan has been a strong partner when it comes to our broader international coalition against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about -- and, tragically, it\xe2\x80\x99s been widely discussed -- that Jordanian military pilots are flying alongside American military pilots, striking ISIL targets in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That is just one indication of the depth of the commitment from the Jordanian people to this broader effort.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly value that relationship and we certainly are interested in maintaining the strong military-to-military national security ties that we have with that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you feel that there is a need to increase military assistance to Jordan, specifically, by giving them more weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific requests that the Jordanians have made for additional --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because lawmakers on Capitol Hill are talking about pulling something together on this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly would consider anything that they were to put forward, but I do think what would drive a decision like that is a specific request from our partners in Jordan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the commitment from Jordan to fly and launch airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 The UAE, which had been part of that coalition, has stopped doing that.\xc2\xa0 What does that say about the strength of this coalition?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that the UAE has given the U.S. for stopping launching airstrikes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did see that announcement from the Emiratis, and I would refer you to them for the latest update in terms of their military participation in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people should take away from that announcement that the commitment from the Emiratis and other Arab countries in the region to this broader coalition has waned in any way.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a very important role for the Emiratis to play in terms of the range of other aspects of our counter-ISIL strategy that requires broad international support.</p>\n<p>So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s providing humanitarian assistance to those who have been displaced by ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s violence, or helping us in the fight against foreign fighters, or working to try to counter the messaging from ISIL that it attempts to radicalize people all across the globe, that there\xe2\x80\x99s still and continues to be an important role for the United Arab Emirates to play in this broad, international coalition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just as a matter of transparency, the military was still listing the UAE on daily news releases as being part of the coalition launching airstrikes against Syria, even after they had stopped doing that.\xc2\xa0 Are there other countries that were part of this coalition that have changed their participation that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But obviously what we have tried to do, aside from some of the documentation that you just cited, is to allow the individual countries to discuss in detail the kind of military operations that they\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 My guess is, without knowing exactly which document you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, it might have been a list of the countries that had to date participated in military airstrikes alongside American military pilots.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this point, all of the countries that you have said are participating in airstrikes, besides the UAE, are still part of that effort?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let the individual countries speak to the detailed sort of day-by-day accounting of their military activities and their participation in military operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more on this topic.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House or the President giving any consideration to increasing the resources that you have in the region to be available to rescue pilots if a plane were to go down?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there has been some reporting that raised questions about whether or not there was sufficient resources available to try to rescue Captain Kasasbeh when his plane went down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Department of Defense has spoken to this, and they did indicate that as soon as the plane went down, an intensive airborne search was immediately initiated and personnel recovery forces were moving toward the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s last known location.</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be in a position to discuss specific response timelines for personnel recovery, but that was not, in this case, a major factor.\xc2\xa0 The simple fact of the matter is that we were not in a position to locate the pilot before he was picked up by ISIL forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President feels comfortable with the resources that he has on the ground if something were to happen with an American pilot over Syria or Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly we would take -- we already have taken the necessary precautions to do everything we can to try to make that very dangerous mission as safe as possible for American fighter pilots who are putting themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President relies significantly on the advice that he gets from the leaders of our uniformed military for questions like this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can tell you that the President is always pushing his team to reevaluate assumptions and to take a look at the strategy to make sure that all of our strategies are pressure-tested, that assumptions are challenged, and that we\'re doing everything that makes strategic sense to do to make this mission effective, to optimize its impact, and to try to put in place precautions that allow our men and women in uniform to do their very important jobs as safely as possible.<br/>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The European Union has criticized Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s execution of the two Iraqis yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering how the President feels about that execution and whether that came up during his meeting with the King yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, we did see reports that the Jordanian government did carry out the execution of two prisoners that had been serving time on death row.\xc2\xa0 These were two individuals that did go through the Jordanian justice system.\xc2\xa0 They were convicted of very serious terrorism-related crimes.\xc2\xa0 These were individuals who were sentenced to death and were serving time on death row.\xc2\xa0 And then we did see reports that their executions were carried out overnight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For questions about the circumstances of their confinement or the decision to move forward on the execution, I\'d refer you to Jordanian authorities who can provide a great deal more insight into the Jordanian justice system than, frankly, I can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House is not criticizing this, unlike the European Union?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, for questions about that specific situation, I\'d refer you to Jordanian authorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, Ash Carter, at his Senate hearing, said he leans in favor of sending arms to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And that seems to go further than what Ben Rhodes said the other day on TV and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if the White House agrees with Ash Carter, or if he\xe2\x80\x99s gone out ahead of the White House on this issue.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the other thing that I noticed that Dr. Carter mentioned in his hearing is that he\xe2\x80\x99s a strong believer in the chain of command, and he certainly understands that the Commander-in-Chief is the top of that chain of command and that a decision like this will be made by the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 That said, the President is certainly interested in the view and opinion and insight of his national security team, including what we hope will be his soon-to-be confirmed new Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And so the President will certainly take that advice into account.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we have made clear is that substantial military assistance has already been provided to the Ukrainian military.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear that an effort to try to bring the Ukrainian military on par with the Russian military is unrealistic, that when we\'re talking about the Russian military we\'re talking about one of the largest militaries on Earth.\xc2\xa0 So the idea that we\'re going to provide enough assistance that would allow the Ukrainian military to be on par with the Russian military is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>That\'s why we know that the only way this situation is going to be resolved is around the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And that is why our strategy has been focused on applying pressure to President Putin and other members of the Russian regime to try to compel them to come to the negotiating table to resolve -- or to deescalate the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That\'s going to continue to be our strategy.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some, including Dr. Carter, who articulated his view at the hearing today, who believe that there might be a benefit to providing additional military assistance to Ukrainian military authorities.\xc2\xa0 And that is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we should, as I was mentioning earlier as it relates to our strategy against ISIL, that we\'re always testing and probing our strategy to make sure that it is optimized.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly, on net neutrality.\xc2\xa0 The FCC Chairman put forth his new proposal today.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House feel about his new proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand from published reports, that the FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has published an overview of his plans to safeguard net neutrality.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly encouraged to see that the FCC is heading in the same direction of safeguarding net neutrality with the strongest possible protections.\xc2\xa0 This is consistent with the view that the President articulated back in the fall.\xc2\xa0 And the President has indicated that as this process moves forward, that additional legislation is not needed.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to withhold a detailed comment about their proposal out of respect for the independent process that the FCC is engaged in right now.\xc2\xa0 This proposal will be subject to a vote of the five members of the -- or five commissioners of the FCC, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more to say about this after that vote has taken place.<br/>\n\tIsaac.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu goes forward, will the President ask Vice President Biden to go to the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Isaac, you know that the Vice President takes his responsibilities as the president of the United States Senate very seriously.\xc2\xa0 That includes even his ceremonial responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 So many of you who have watched the Vice President dig in with gusto as he swears in new members of the United States Congress -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve done that a couple of times, and I think that the rating for C-SPAN have gone through the roof when he\xe2\x80\x99s had the opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But another of his ceremonial duties is to be a part of any joint session of Congress that is convened.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there have been a number of joint sessions that have been convened while he\xe2\x80\x99s been Vice President, and the Vice President has only missed one.\xc2\xa0 He missed one back in March of 2011 when then-Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke before a joint session of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, at that point, the Vice President was out of the country and did not attend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as it relates to the speech that Prime Minister Netanyahu has planned for the first week in March, I can tell you that the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for that week has not yet been set.\xc2\xa0 So as we get some more details worked out of his schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to let you know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to attend that joint session.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would the President want the Vice President to be there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is going to be contingent on his schedule.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one time in which the Vice President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been there and it\xe2\x80\x99s when he\xe2\x80\x99s been out of the country.\xc2\xa0 So as we get some more details for that first week in March locked down on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on that.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous -- there are some Democrats who are talking about skipping the speech.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous for American-Israeli relations for Democrats to potentially boycott the Netanyahu speech?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly individual members of Congress will have to make their own decision, some of which I assume will be driven by their schedule and some of it will be driven by their own views about what has transpired over the last several weeks as it relates to this speech.</p>\n<p>Let me just say as a general matter, that when I was asked about Ambassador Dermer\xe2\x80\x99s status a couple of -- maybe it was just even last week -- that the President believed that it was important to uphold a broader tradition of ensuring that the strong relationship between the United States and Israel was not in any way subjugated to partisan politics in either country, frankly.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- one of the concerns about the breach in protocol that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and articulated is that it might cause some to view the relationship between the United States and Israel as a relationship between one political party in Israel and one political party in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that would be a positive development in our relationship.</p>\n<p>And so the President is certainly doing everything that he can to try to avoid that.\xc2\xa0 And that -- in fact, that is one of the reasons that the President has said he will not meet with the Israeli Prime Minister when he is in town the first week in March, because the President does not want to leave anybody with even the appearance of interfering in the Israeli elections scheduled for just two weeks later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given that -- so does he think that Democrats should go to the speech if it happens?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess to give you a more direct answer, the President believes that individual members ought to decide for themselves.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly appropriate.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, coming back to the UAE, do you believe that the coalition has been strengthened or weakened by this whole episode involving the Jordanian pilot?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you heard from the President yesterday that the commitment of the United States and other members of the coalition has only been strengthened.\xc2\xa0 I think he referred to redoubling our efforts to carry out this strategy against ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think you saw that sentiment echoed in the statement from King Abdullah yesterday as well, who indicated that the people of Jordan would not show weakness in the face of this barbaric act.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an indication of their strengthened commitment to this broader international coalition, and I think that is representative of the sentiment of others who are participants in this coalition.\xc2\xa0 But I only speak for one member of the coalition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the UAE had been perhaps the biggest contributor to the air campaign, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been now over a month since they have taken part in any airstrikes over Iraq or Syria.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a pretty significant blow to the coalition, and one that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t informed of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked excessively about the strength of this coalition over the past weeks and months.\xc2\xa0 This seems to be a pretty significant setback to have the UAE no longer flying with American pilots.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly have appreciated the wide range of commitments that the United Arab Emirates has made to this broader international coalition, including their military commitments.\xc2\xa0 But, Jon, I can tell you that the pace of operations in Syria has not slowed; that with their -- to date, more than 1,000 strikes over Syria have been carried out, and these have targeted a wide range of things -- everything from ISIL fighters themselves to their commanders, hundreds of vehicles and tanks, nearly 260 oil and gas facilities.</p>\n<p>And just recently --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What percentage --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say one other thing, which is, just recently, we learned -- and as been reported by some of you -- that ISIL fighters have abandoned the city of Kobani.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve essentially been defeated in Kobani.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been defeated, as ISIL fighters themselves said, because of the strong coordination between forces on the ground and the airstrikes carried out by coalition pilots.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is an indication that the air campaign that\'s being waged over the skies of Syria remains incredibly and, in some cases, even devastatingly effective.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what percentage of those airstrikes over Syria over the last month have been U.S. pilots?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I don\'t have that information in front of me, but you can check with the Department of Defense about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then can you give a direct answer to the concerns that have been expressed by UAE about the -- what they see as a lack of an effective search and research?\xc2\xa0 Clearly, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t effective -- but a lack of a timely search-and-rescue effort to get that Jordanian pilot back?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned in the statement that the Department of Defense issued, that they did commence an intensive airborne search immediately after the plane went down, and that there were personnel recovery forces en route to his last known location.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the UAE does not have a legitimate point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is this:\xc2\xa0 The response timeline, as the Department of Defense has said, as it relates to this case of Captain Kasasbeh, was not a major factor in this case, that the response timeline was not the major factor.</p>\n<p>But the other thing that I think is relevant is that the American pilots, American military pilots continue to fly over Syria.\xc2\xa0 And they only do that because the President believes that we have taken the necessary precautions for them to carry out what is admittedly a very dangerous mission as safely as possible, and that there are resources available for contingencies should they arise.</p>\n<p>And I don\'t think anybody would suggest that this Commander-in-Chief, at least, takes lightly his responsibility to make sure that those kinds of strategies are in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just one more question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 We heard from President Rouhani saying, in his words, differences have decreased between the Iranians and European and U.S. powers on this.\xc2\xa0 Is it your assessment that President Rouhani is right?\xc2\xa0 Have the differences decreased?\xc2\xa0 Have the two sides gotten closer to coming to an agreement on the Iranian nuclear program?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that for quite some time now, these negotiations have been ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to say that progress has been made, but I don\'t want to leave you with the impression that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t still very difficult sticking points that remain.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we better than 50/50 now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would not change our assessment that we are at best -- at best -- 50/50 in terms of the likelihood that an agreement is reached.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talking about the UAE, you\'ve mentioned it many times in here as a significant partner in the coalition.\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like you\'re saying that the loss of their airstrikes over the last month hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really made much of an impact.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t that saying that their contribution really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much of an impact positively in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that at all.\xc2\xa0 We certainly value the very important contribution that the Emiratis have made to this broader strategy.\xc2\xa0 That includes their military contribution, but is not limited to it; that there are important financial contributions that they have made to this broader effort, some of which are related to dealing with the urgent humanitarian crisis that\'s been created by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the Emiratis have an important role to play in the Muslim world to countering some of the radical extremist messaging that we have seen from ISIL.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about how ISIL has attempted to use social media in rather sophisticated ways to try to radicalize populations in other countries.\xc2\xa0 And one part of countering that messaging is to ensure that moderate voices in the Muslim world are also heard, and that those messages are countered.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the Emiratis have a lot of credibility when it comes to that, and we certainly appreciate their cooperation in that aspect of the campaign too.</p>\n<p>That\'s to say nothing of the efforts of our ongoing strategy to choke off the funding for ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s operations.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of months ago, you had David Cohen from the Treasury Department standing here at the podium sort of detailing our efforts to choke off funding for ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Those efforts continue.\xc2\xa0 It requires the close coordination and cooperation of our partners across the globe, but particularly in the region.\xc2\xa0 The UAE has been very helpful on that front, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But while those elements might be very important in the long run, it doesn\'t really stop ISIS on the ground in the short term.\xc2\xa0 And for the loss of the UAE\xe2\x80\x99s airstrikes not really making that much of an impact, as you say, that the pace is continued, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that just again point to the fact that the U.S. continues to do the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the work militarily?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that the United States of America is playing the leading role in this international coalition.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is proud that as the Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, that the United States is leading in this effort.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 But it does not in any way diminish the contributions of others that have an important role to play here.\xc2\xa0 And we are certainly proud to continue to have the support of the Emiratis as we pursue this strategy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard repeatedly yesterday from the President and others about redoubling the commitment, reinforcing the vigilance of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 So now that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from Jordan that they want to do more airstrikes, is it likely that everyone is going to be contributing more at this period of time, including the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly would welcome additional contributions from other countries, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work to make sure that this wide variety of efforts is carefully integrated.\xc2\xa0 And that is an important part of this coalition as well, that we want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not duplicating efforts and that our efforts continues to be very carefully integrated.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the kind of support and continued willingness from the Jordanians and all the other members of the coalition to executing this strategy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from some in the Pentagon that some would like to see the U.S. pace increase but that the White House has favored more of a steady pace as it\xe2\x80\x99s been.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that that is the case?\xc2\xa0 And will we see the U.S. contribute more?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard those complaints firsthand.\xc2\xa0 I guess in order to respond to them, I\xe2\x80\x99d want a little more detailed assessment of what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that this is something that the President feels strongly about, and the President is pleased with the way that members of our military have handled their responsibilities in this effort; that the challenges put before our military are significant and their success in carrying out this operation and doing so in close coordination with more than 60 countries is no small feat.\xc2\xa0 And the national security interests of the United States are incredibly well-served by it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind one quick question.\xc2\xa0 When the President was talking -- or it came out in a readout, I guess, of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the King -- this ironclad support for Jordan.\xc2\xa0 Would that then include support for its reaction to the murder of the pilot through these executions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to the news overnight that a couple of individuals who had been convicted of crimes related to terrorism, that they\xe2\x80\x99d been executed.\xc2\xa0 Again, they\xe2\x80\x99d gone through the Jordanian justice system, they\xe2\x80\x99d been convicted, they were sentenced to death, they were serving time on death row, and their executions were carried out overnight.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Jordanian authorities for additional information about that.</p>\n<p>Lalit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, today at his confirmation hearing, Ash Carter told congressmen that he would recommend changing the plan in Afghanistan, both the pace and the size of the forces -- this was in Afghanistan -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s a change in the situation inside Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Is that the final plan, or is the President willing to change the plan depending on the situation in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the last part is the key part of this, Lalit -- that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- again, based on -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t watch the testimony firsthand, so correct me if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get this right.\xc2\xa0 But my understanding about the way that he had described his view was that he was open to changing the pace based on conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But I think that as things stand right now, I believe that he is supportive of the strategy that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President has been very clear about what he believes our strategy should be.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to predict with 100 percent certainty exactly what security conditions are going to be, but the President is committed to this strategy.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes it serves our national security interests very well for us to responsibly wind down the war in Afghanistan and to reduce our military footprint there.\xc2\xa0 The President has laid out a clear strategy for doing it, and the President is pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing it and is hopeful that it will be effective.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If I might, just before you ask your question, your colleague was here yesterday and asked a question about the Affordable Care Act, and I think this is one of those awkward situations where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand the question that he was asking.\xc2\xa0 So if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me eating into a little bit of your time, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll repay on the backend, let me try to better answer the question that I believe that he was asking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that he was raising a question about individuals who will be assessed a fee for not purchasing health insurance in 2014, even though they could afford it.\xc2\xa0 And it is true, according to CBO estimates, that it is possible that millions of people could be affected by this.\xc2\xa0 And so let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The first is, it is, as I mentioned yesterday, also true that millions of Americans saw their taxes reduced so that they could afford health insurance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also true that, as I mentioned yesterday, that three-quarters of Americans will only have to check a box on their tax forms to confirm that they have -- that they did have health insurance in 2014.\xc2\xa0 And the likelihood of this fee affecting a taxpayer, we\xe2\x80\x99re only talking about a range of 2 to 4 percent of taxpayers who are affected.</p>\n<p>Last couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it is possible for people to qualify for an exemption in certain circumstances.\xc2\xa0 So that possibility is held, and I that was essentially the essence of his question -- is there anything that people in this situation can do.\xc2\xa0 There are certain cases I think that are rather complicated where individuals could apply or qualify for an exception.</p>\n<p>I think the last piece of advice I would have for individuals who may be watching us or reading this who are concerned about having to pay a fee in 2014, is to make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0 And fortunately, they have until February 15th to sign up for health insurance at healthcare.gov for 2015 to ensure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay this fee in 2015.</p>\n<p>So I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to clarify all that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No problem.\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) outstanding journalist.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wanted to get your answer; I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you gave it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Jordan and ISIS.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confused by your answer to Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question about the executions that happened overnight, when you said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How can the President yesterday say, we\xe2\x80\x99re here, we support Jordan, they\xe2\x80\x99re a key member of the coalition; they make this decision overnight and you can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether or not you support the executions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, it is certainly possible for us to continue to support and stand with the people of Jordan at this very difficult time.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, their nation, in the same way that we all are, is shocked and appalled at this terrible act of violence that was captured on video by ISIL and released to the world.\xc2\xa0 And the United States stands with our friends in Jordan as they confront this awful, barbaric act.</p>\n<p>But as it relates to decisions that are carried out by the Jordanian justice system, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the working knowledge of the Jordanian justice system to render an opinion on this.\xc2\xa0 All I know is that the individuals that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing here were individuals who were convicted of terrorism-related crimes.\xc2\xa0 They were individuals who were sentenced to death.\xc2\xa0 And these were individuals who had been serving time on death row.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s ask, though, about something that you do have an impact on, which the White House said, which is support, direct support for Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And back to one of Julie\xe2\x80\x99s first questions, you seemed to be suggesting that the White House was not aware that the King was in Washington to, in part -- large part -- to get more support from the administration and the Congress for weapons, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, the administration is standing squarely behind the people of Jordan and the King, and we are certainly supportive of any efforts that are underway to try to strengthen his national security and to strengthen his ability to make tangible contributions to this broader campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t aware of a request.\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that the King in the Oval Office last night didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask President Obama for more help?\xc2\xa0 Or in recent weeks, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a conversation with the Vice President, the national security advisor?\xc2\xa0 Are you really saying Jordan hasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked for more weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out any of the detailed conversations, at least in a detailed way, the conversations that the King had while he was here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 As has been reported, he did visit with the President yesterday, he had the opportunity to talk to the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 I know that he spoke to the Secretary of State as well.\xc2\xa0 So he had a number of conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read them out in a detailed way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made it no secret he wants more weapons, he wants to step up the campaign against ISIS.\xc2\xa0 That\'s on the record.\xc2\xa0 So, A, did he ask the White House for that support?\xc2\xa0 And, B, is the President going to give him that support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\'t have a detailed accounting of the conversation that the President had with the King in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And the United States continues to stand with the people of Jordan and our ally, the King of Jordan, as they --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you stand with them, why can\'t you say you\'re going to support and give them more weapons?\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I\'m just struggling to understand.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because, Ed, a lot of this requires important coordination not just in terms of the work that we have to do with the Congress, but also in terms of the work that we\'ll do with the Jordanians to ensure that we\'re providing the actual assistance that they are requesting and that they need.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like in a lot of your answers there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be anything new coming from the White House today in the wake of what happened yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It seems, in the case of King Abdullah, he really seemed to believe this is a game-changer.\xc2\xa0 I understand there was a horrible impact on his country, but on the entire coalition.\xc2\xa0 This was a pilot who was working on behalf of a coalition led by this President.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, it seems like the strategy here in terms of defeating ISIS is status quo; that nothing changed yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the President is committing to do?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything to step up the campaign against ISIS at all from the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, we have talked about how these kinds of ongoing efforts are going to be difficult and that it\'s going to be difficult to measure success or failure in one-day increments.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re focused on is the longer-term arc.\xc2\xa0 I think the best example I have for this is that last fall there was extensive, even breathless coverage about the success that ISIL has had, or did have at that time, in making significant inroads into this border village called Kobani.\xc2\xa0 And just last -- over the weekend, we saw news reports that ISIL has been repelled from that village and that ISIL fighters themselves attributed their retreat to the success of ground operations that were supported by airstrikes from coalition pilots.</p>\n<p>So that is an indication that, yes, the situation in Kobani was concerning.\xc2\xa0 But over the long term, this administration led the international coalition to implement a strategy that was successful in repelling that ISIL advance.</p>\n<p>There are any number of similar stories to be told in Iraq. And this not a matter of sort of doing a minute-by-minute play-by-play here.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter of staying focused on our broader goal.\xc2\xa0 And one of those goals is keeping together this coalition.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has been so clear, and why I\'m doing my best to be as clear as I can about our commitment to standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Jordan as they deal with this terrible tragedy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a summit on violent extremism coming up in a week or two.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any thought about moving that up, given events over the last 24, 48 hours, that this should be at the top of mind at the White House, this should happen today, tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Where is the sense of urgency?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, the fact of the matter is this issue of foreign fighters and countering violent extremism is something that this administration has been focused on for a long, long time.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that even in the earliest days of the administration, John Brennan went to NYU and gave a pretty important policy speech about our ongoing efforts to work with communities all across the country to try to counter violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 And this, again, as part of this ongoing effort, the President, for just the second time in United Nations history, convened a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to talk about the broader international effort to shut down the movement of foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so this is something that is ongoing, and there is work that is done here in this White House on a daily basis to try to mitigate this threat to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the countering violent extremism summit that we\'re convening next week -- or in two weeks will be a very important part and an important contribution to that effort.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning, the new Surgeon General said that preliminary data shows that marijuana could be helpful in certain medical conditions.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you have any comment on that, if this is a sense that the White House is changing its position on medical marijuana.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually see those comments, Steve, so I might actually take your question and take a look at those comments a little more carefully before I get you a reaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a second issue, on the budget, the President seemed to issue a veto threat when he was making his comments on the budget; he said he wouldn\'t accept sequester levels going forward.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like that\'s almost a threat of a government shutdown if the Republicans do not increase spending.\xc2\xa0 Is that the right way to look at that?\xc2\xa0 Is that a veto threat that if the Republicans don\'t increase spending, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign any of those spending bills?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know there has been an effort to sort of do a little running tally of veto threats that have been issued by the White House.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure this qualifies, simply because we haven\'t seen a piece of legislation from Congress.\xc2\xa0 So we typically issue veto threats around specific bills.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I do think that the President is very firm in his belief that the mindless, across-the-board cuts that we\'ve seen as a part of the sequester have been bad for our economy and they certainly have not been helpful to our national security.</p>\n<p>And I recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s actually some bipartisan agreement around that.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re going to be working in bipartisan fashion with Congress to make some of those changes to the budget in a way that reflects bipartisan common ground, because that\'s going to be what\xe2\x80\x99s required to actually pass these funding bills, but also reflects a focus on our core priorities, which is protecting the country and protecting the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One veto threat that he\xe2\x80\x99s issued in past years on the sequester was absent this week.\xc2\xa0 And two years ago, when he was talking about the sequester at that podium, he basically -- he said, I will veto a replacement that did not include new revenue, new taxes.\xc2\xa0 Is the President open to doing what the Republicans are insisting -- John Boehner and others -- that you replace the sequester with other cuts?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly plenty of other cuts the President has in his own budget -- $400 billion in health care savings -- that in the past few years the President has put in a lock box, basically.\xc2\xa0 He said, I\'m only going to touch these entitlement cuts if the Republicans come to the table with a tax increase.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Steve, we haven\'t seen a specific proposal from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that there is a principle that does endure to this day, which is the President believes that to the extent that we\'re looking to reduce the deficit even further, that we need to pursue a balanced approach in doing so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And just asking the middle class or the elderly to bear the burden of reducing our deficit, it\'s not fair.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also not the best way for us to keep our commitment to our seniors.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also not the best way to grow our economy.\xc2\xa0 Our economy grows best when it\xe2\x80\x99s growing from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 And asking our middle class to bear the burden alone of reducing the deficit, that doesn\'t make a lot of economic sense.\xc2\xa0 And that is a principle the President has previously articulated, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that continues to apply today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that actually still a veto threat, though?\xc2\xa0 In the past he\xe2\x80\x99s said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will veto.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that V-word on a sequester replacement that did not include revenue.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the reason, simply, is that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a specific piece of legislation from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And that is typically when we\xe2\x80\x99ll use the V-word, as you described it.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll withhold that word for now.\xc2\xa0 But that principle is firmly in place.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of taxes, you guys put out your proposal on international corporate taxes, and the Republicans -- who haven\xe2\x80\x99t always been kind to the administration -- had a lot of supportive things to say.\xc2\xa0 Representative Boustany said it was the right direction.\xc2\xa0 The Chairman of House Ways and Means said, constructive.\xc2\xa0 Senator Enzi said, a step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House encouraged by the Republican reaction so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly welcome that kind of constructive response from Republicans that -- again, that Representative Boustany is not somebody with whom we\'re going to agree on a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 But we can\'t allow those disagreements on those other issues to prevent us from trying to find common ground where it does exist.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it sounds like, based on his comments, that there might be an opportunity for us to have a conversation and a constructive one -- no pun intended -- about -- nobody is going to laugh at that -- about international tax reform and using that revenue to invest in infrastructure projects.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there an active conversation now going on with leaders in sort of tax thought on the Republican congressional side --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about for quite some time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be a part of the conversations.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Director of the OMB, Shaun Donovan, is actually testifying on Capitol Hill today about some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are interested in preserving an open dialogue on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since you\'ve released that, have you had actual active discussions with Republicans on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail all of the discussions that have been underway.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know off the top of my head what committee Congressman Boustany serves on.\xc2\xa0 Do you have it in front of you?\xc2\xa0 No?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a pop quiz, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 Or I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s a pop quiz for me, but not for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Twelve years ago I would have when I covered Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The point is, there have been extensive conversations on Capitol Hill both in the run-up to and the immediate aftermath of the submission of the budget.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s included congressional testimony from people like Secretary Lew and Shaun Donovan, the Director of the OMB.\xc2\xa0 So those lines of communication are open.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question on this.\xc2\xa0 Other Republicans say, hey, the administration has not been good to deal with on taxes.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that sentiment among some?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage them to take it up with those Republicans that actually think we have put forward constructive proposals.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that there are a lot of Democrats who -- the vast majority of Democrats are strongly supportive of the kinds of proposals that the President has put forward.\xc2\xa0 So it seems possible to me that we can cobble together a bipartisan coalition here relying on a large number of Republicans -- or at least a large number of Democrats and at least enough Republicans to move this across the finish line.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How likely?\xc2\xa0 Better than the Iranian deal?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put any odds on a tax deal.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly view this as a worthy pursuit, and it could be a fruitful conversation that we\'re going to devote some significant time and resources to pursuing.</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 With the vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I note that on other occasions you\'ve said and the President had said, there has been 40 such votes to repeal it.\xc2\xa0 Republican members of Congress --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re up to 56 now, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Republican members of Congress insist there are only four direct repeal votes, and that many of the votes you count as repeal votes are things that, for example, are putting legislative force behind what the President did by executive order, notably the delaying of implementation in certain cases.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response?\xc2\xa0 Do you stand by the 56 figure?\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that is inaccurate right now.\xc2\xa0 And many of the things you count are things the President himself support.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for -- there are 56 of them, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to account for every single one of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifty-six of what?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Efforts to undermine or repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Undermine or repeal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And so since you brought it up, I did notice that there were a couple of Republican members of Congress who voted against repealing or undermining the Affordable Care Act, and I was struck by why.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Poliquin said, \xe2\x80\x9cShow me a fix and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have my support.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Congressman Katko said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am disappointed that the bill taken up by Congress today did not provide a real solution to the rising costs of health care.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And we saw Congressman Dold indicate that, \xe2\x80\x9cCasting yet another symbolic vote for full repeal of the law, without any replacement legislation, simply distracts us from the work that must be done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>This is an indication that even Republicans are a little skeptical of the promises from other Republicans that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to come forward with a specific replacement proposal; that we see Republicans take these symbolic votes that don\xe2\x80\x99t actually -- as Congressman Dold said -- don\xe2\x80\x99t actually do anything other than \xe2\x80\x9cdistract us from the work that must be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I think it is an indication that Republicans are not really serious about health care reform; that they continue to use this as a political tool, but certainly the millions of Americans across the country who are getting health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act don\xe2\x80\x99t consider this to be a game or anything like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there\xe2\x80\x99s 56 symbolic votes, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just relying on the widespread public reporting of this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify when you were asked about whether or not the coalition has been strengthened or weakened by what has happened here, and you said that we\xe2\x80\x99re redoubling our efforts and the commitment has been strengthened.\xc2\xa0 But I wonder, given the fact that before this horrible murder of the pilot there were plans to try to make a deal -- something that the United States has not wanted to do -- and the fact that the Emiratis have stopped with the airstrikes, do you feel confident that the coalition has been strengthened or has ISIS has been successful in weakening it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I feel confident that the coalition has been strengthened.\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States thinks that and the King of Jordan thinks that.\xc2\xa0 They both indicated as much yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to say much about a Jordanian effort to secure the release of their pilot but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident in saying that their efforts to secure his release in no way reflected a diminished commitment to the broader international coalition or the broader strategy against ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, I think if you look at the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s driving ISIL fighters out of Kobani or repelling and rolling back the advance of ISIL fighters across Western Iraq, the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in shutting down the sources of funding -- that there a variety of measures that we can point to, to indicate that this coalition, this strong coalition is continuing to build momentum as we take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And now, as I pointed out to Ed, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean -- this is not a score that we can keep on a daily basis; that these kinds of efforts require sustained commitment and there are going to be setbacks.\xc2\xa0 But I think the overall trajectory here is positive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give any detail on the conversation, but do you have anything more for us on that conversation yesterday?\xc2\xa0 And since the President met with the King, has he made any other calls to leaders of the coalition countries?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional readout of the conversation between the President and the King.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to calls with foreign leaders, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any that the President has placed since last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just finally, the President had said over the weekend that anything kind of related to this he takes a look at, when he did the interview with Savannah.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen this latest video?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s seen it, no.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a new national security strategy scheduled to be announced on Friday.\xc2\xa0 Will it contain more specifics about exactly what the strategy is in Iraq, Afghanistan and generally in combatting ISIS?\xc2\xa0 And will it contain a draft resolution or an authorization of the use of military force?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will encourage you to stay tuned for the release of that document.\xc2\xa0 I know that the national security advisor intends to give a public speech on this issue on Friday as well, so there will be a couple of ways you can learn what\xe2\x80\x99s included in there.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the authorization to use military force, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that that is something that will be released in the context of the national security strategy, but there has been important work and important progress made on that ongoing effort to consult with members of Congress to develop legislative language that could earn bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more news on an AUMF relatively soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Relatively soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up on a question that Isaac asked a little bit earlier about the upcoming visit by Prime Minister Netanyahu to the U.S. and the address that he will give to a joint session of Congress.\xc2\xa0 You had said that the reason that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t be meeting with the Prime Minister is because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give the appearance of somehow influencing the Israeli election.\xc2\xa0 Would that same rationale apply to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s attendance at the joint session of Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll see, I think is really the best answer I can give you there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working through exactly what the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is going to look like that first week in March, and certainly as we consider the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s attendance, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the factors that we\xe2\x80\x99ll weigh on that decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also said in answering Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s question that the Vice President has been here for virtually every joint session of Congress when a foreign leader has spoken.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the one time he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been there was when he was out of town.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s in town on that particular day, should the Israeli government see that as a sign of disrespect?\xc2\xa0 How do you think they should view that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s wait until we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a decision and that decision has been carried out before we start estimating exactly what the reaction will be from other people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question regarding this.\xc2\xa0 Does the President view the invitation by House Speaker John Boehner as an effort to influence the Israeli election in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said is that that was a decision that the Speaker made on his own.\xc2\xa0 It did represent a departure from protocol, but ultimately, that\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that the Speaker of the House has to make.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it is important for us to ensure that the Israeli-U.S. relationship does not get reduced to partisan politics; that the relationship between our two countries is much more than the relationship between two political parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is an important principle, and the President is going to conduct himself accordingly.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that other members of Congress and other U.S. and Israeli leaders will do the same.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to determine -- make their own decisions about their behavior.</p>\n<p>Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda for his meeting with Muslim leaders this afternoon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President is looking forward to the meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do a little later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not unusual for the President to meet with the leaders of a wide variety of communities from across the country. Sometimes that includes religious leaders; sometimes that includes leaders that are involved in academia or other specific issue areas.</p>\n<p>What the President is hoping to do is to have a broader conversation about the wide range of issues that are of importance to the Muslim American community.\xc2\xa0 Certainly I would expect a robust discussion on a lot of the kind of middle-class economics that the President has been discussing in the State of the Union and in the context of the rollout of his budget.</p>\n<p>I would anticipate that it will be an opportunity for the President to talk about some other things.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that he\xe2\x80\x99ll remind them of the upcoming deadline for the Affordable Care Act, and encouraging them to get the word out in their communities about the opportunity that exists for people who previously couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford health insurance but now may be able to by going to healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>So I think it will be a pretty wide-ranging meeting.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do our best to get you a readout of that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask a follow-up on the hangings in Jordan last night?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if the President agrees that there\xe2\x80\x99s an important international principle of law here, because after the burning of the Jordanian pilot, the spokesman for the government of Jordan came out and said \xe2\x80\x9cwe will have revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And then hours later, they carried out these two executions.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, does the President support any ally using the death penalty as a form of revenge?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dave, again, the executions that were carried out by the Jordanian justice system were -- I guess questions about those executions are questions that you should direct to Jordanian authorities.</p>\n<p>Again, these are individuals who were convicted of very serious terrorism-related crimes.\xc2\xa0 They were sentenced to death, and they had been serving time on death row.\xc2\xa0 So for questions about how, or why, or what the motivation was for carrying out that sentence are questions that you should direct to Jordanian authorities.</p>\n<p>Let me just say that the United States continues to stand strongly beside our friends in Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to welcome their support and commitment to this broader international campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, the North Korean leader emphasized that North Korea don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk with the United States anymore.\xc2\xa0 What would be President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policy toward North Korea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What would be President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\'m sorry I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Policy to North Korea.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sorry that I had difficulty understanding.\xc2\xa0 Our policy toward North Korea has not changed.\xc2\xa0 We believe it is critically important for that regime to come into compliance with generally accepted international standards and to start doing the kinds of things that reflect the commitment to basic universal human rights that we hold dear in this country, and we believe that other governments have a responsibility to protect those basic human rights when it comes to their citizens.\xc2\xa0 And that policy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Certainly, our efforts to work with the international community, to try to bring North Korea into compliance with those things, those efforts continue.\xc2\xa0 And certainly other countries, even countries that we don\xe2\x80\x99t often have a close alliance with -- countries like Russia and China -- have an interest in the same way that we do in trying to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s significant concerns about North Korea, about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of their citizens, and about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And those efforts are ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be more aggressively approaching the North Korea, the United States (inaudible) more aggressively?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a change in strategy or policy to tell you about.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:48 P.M.
