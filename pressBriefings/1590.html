EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to everyone for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a good opportunity to run you briefly through the Vice President\'s trip to the Balkans next week and maybe highlight some of the high points of the schedule and also talk a little bit about what we hope to accomplish, and then take some questions.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">There are three pieces to the trip.\xc2\xa0 The first piece will be in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 And he has a packed schedule there that starts with a meeting with the Bosnian tri-presidency that moves to a joint meeting with the governing coalition.\xc2\xa0 He\'s looking forward to having some time also with President Dodik, and also with Haris Silajdzic, who he\'s known for a long time.\xc2\xa0 There will be an address to the Parliament in Bosnia, and then an opportunity for the Vice President to spend some time with our embassy and its staff.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And one of the important pieces I just want to highlight on the Bosnia portion of the trip is that he will be accompanied in Bosnia by the European Union\'s senior foreign policy official, Javier Solana, as well as by the High Representative, Valentin Inzkov.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll be with him for all of those meetings throughout the day.<br/> <br/>  On Wednesday, we move from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Serbia.\xc2\xa0 And there we\'re looking very much forward to being received first by President Tadic.\xc2\xa0 He will meet with the President.\xc2\xa0 There will be a larger meeting with the President and his cabinet.\xc2\xa0 And then there will be an opportunity for the Vice President and President Tadic to make brief statements to the press.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will also meet during the day with the Defense Minister and the Chief of the Armed Forces.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll meet with our embassy staff, as he always likes to do, and will conclude the evening with a dinner hosted by President Tadic and members of the government and members of the community in Belgrade -- business, civil society, et cetera.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And then finally, the last piece of the trip is on Thursday, and that will take us to Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 And in Pristina, the Vice President will have an opportunity to meet with the President, the Prime Minister, and the Foreign Minister and the Assembly Speaker.\xc2\xa0 He will be addressing the Assembly in Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll also have an opportunity to go out to Camp Bondsteel to speak to and meet with our troops.\xc2\xa0 And there are probably some other events during the Kosovo portion that we\'ll be able to talk about next week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And that\'s a very brief and broad snapshot of the trip.\xc2\xa0 Let me just talk briefly if I may, and then take your questions after that, about what we hope to accomplish.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Starting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the fact that the Vice President is going is evidence that we are looking to demonstrate intensified U.S. engagement in the region, starting with Bosnia; and in Bosnia, to demonstrate our unequivocal support for Dayton, for Bosnian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the state-building reforms that still need to be accomplished in order for Bosnia-Herzegovina to move toward NATO and EU membership.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The Vice President is going to underscore to the leaders he meets with, from all sides, the need to work across ethnic lines to build consensus on reforms moving forward, and also to fulfill the conditions required to close the office of the High Representative, and transition, as I think most of you know, to the EU.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, he will be accompanied throughout by Javier Solana and Valentin Inzkov.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Moving on to Serbia, the objective in a sense is very straightforward.\xc2\xa0 This is a tremendous opportunity to make it very clear to the government of Serbia and to the people of Serbia that we hope to be able to press the reset button with Serbia -- an opportunity to make it clear that we see and we want a very positive future for Serbia in the Euro-Atlantic community, and as a leader in the region.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\'s hard to imagine a future for the region without Serbia playing a major role -- a future that is positive and productive.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the message that the Vice President will want to underscore.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, we have some differences that we\'re not going to resolve, particularly over Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 But we think there\'s an opportunity for a new beginning; to move toward a closer, more constructive and cooperative relationship that can move Serbia toward the Euro-Atlantic community and the institutions that go along with that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And finally, the last piece of the trip -- Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 There the Vice President will have an opportunity to underscore our commitment to a unified, independent, multiethnic Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be talking to the leaders of Kosovo about the tremendous efforts they\'ve already made to build a functioning and effective state, and to protect the rights of all minorities.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">There\'s more work to be done on improving governance, on the economy, on meaningful outreach to Kosovo Serbs, and also strengthening relations with the rest of Europe.\xc2\xa0 But his visit there will be underscoring our strong support for a unified, independent, and multiethnic Kosovo.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So those are really the highlights of the trip.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important in one final sense, which, as I think many of you know, the Vice President has a long and deep personal history with the region in the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 His leadership in the Senate in efforts to end violence and ethnic cleansing first in Bosnia, and then in Kosovo, I think are well known.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And the fact that he and the President decided that he should go now to the Balkans, particularly given his engagement, is evidence of the desire here within the Obama-Biden administration to demonstrate, in a sense, that we\'re back; that the Balkans is very much a key part of our agenda; that the tremendous investment that the United States and European countries made in the Balkans in the 1990s to move it away from ethnic cleansing and from violence and from division -- that investment is one that we care about and that we want to move forward on.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And the Vice President, by his presence there, is going to demonstrate I think the administration\'s commitment to very strong United States\' support for moving all three countries toward a future in the Euro-Atlantic community.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Let me stop with that and take any questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 If I think I heard you right -- and I apologize again because again it was breaking up -- I think you were asking about the last time the Vice President was in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that was as senator in 2001.\xc2\xa0 He was there many times in the 1990s, starting, actually, back in \'93, he visited Bosnia and, in fact, authored a report back then after that visit that advocated lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia.\xc2\xa0 And that led ultimately to the adoption of the lift and strike policy by the Clinton administration.\xc2\xa0 And then there were numerous trips after that throughout the 1990s, to Bosnia, to Kosovo, and the last trip I believe was in 2001.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And again, I apologize because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the question clearly, but that\'s what I think you were asking.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Are there any new and different signs of American foreign policy concerning the Balkans?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are.\xc2\xa0 I think, first of all, the fact, as I said, the Vice President is going is a very strong sign of our engagement in all three countries and in the region:\xc2\xa0 a strong desire on the part of the President and the Vice President to engage the United States in the work of, in the case of Bosnia, of sustaining Dayton and pursuing necessary reforms and moving toward NATO and the EU; in the case of Serbia, making it clear how much we welcome and desire a strong relationship with Serbia, and Serbia getting into a strong place in the region and in Europe; and in Kosovo, our strong support for Kosovo\'s sovereignty, independence as a unified, multiethnic state.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think, in a sense, the trip itself is the message; the fact that very early on in this administration, after I think a period in which the United States was not particularly focused on the Balkans -- that that in and of itself is indicative of a refocus on the region and on different countries in the region.</div> <div class="legacy-para">There will be some specific things that emerge I think out of each visit, and I\'ll let those emerge as they emerge during the Vice President\'s visit.\xc2\xa0 But the main point really is that, in a sense, the United States is back; the focus that we had in the 1990s on the region is back, but it\'s back in a different way.\xc2\xa0 Thankfully, we are dealing now with efforts in all three countries to help them move toward a strong future with the United States, with Europe, with NATO and the EU.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the effort.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 I basically have two issues that I wanted to raise.\xc2\xa0 One would be that in this time could there be a token -- for this refocusing, could there be an expectation that the Vice President could announce a possible U.S. envoy to the Balkans?\xc2\xa0 That would be the first one.\xc2\xa0 And the second issue is, there a larger dimension to this visit?\xc2\xa0 I remember the Vice President -- (inaudible) -- Kosovo declared independence -- he had an op/ed in which Kosovo\'s independence was taken like a rapprochement to the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 So could this be sort of a logical blueprint to possible rapprochement between -- (inaudible) -- and Israel?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In terms of any specifics that emerge from the trip, I\'m going to let those, as I say, emerge in their own time.\xc2\xa0 And so if there are any announcements of anything along the way, the Vice President will handle those.\xc2\xa0 So I really can\'t answer your question one way or another.\xc2\xa0 On an envoy, that\'s something that\'s under consideration, but there is no decision on that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And in terms of the larger message, look, I think that in many ways, the actions and efforts of the United States during the 1990s to go to the assistance and aid of people who were the victims of ethnic cleansing and who were under fire and who, in two cases, happened to be Muslims -- in Bosnia and then in Kosovo -- should have spoken volumes.\xc2\xa0 And I think now, as I said, thankfully, we\'re in a totally different situation where both Bosnia and Kosovo have gotten through incredibly difficult times, and now we\'re in a phase where their efforts are to build strong, functioning states that can move toward integration in all of the institutions of the Euro-Atlantic community.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But there, too, I think that will speak volumes.\xc2\xa0 When you have a strong Muslim community in Bosnia, of course, and a majority Muslim population in Kosovo, I think it does send a message about the future as we see it that includes very strong and positive relations between our country and other countries, including countries that have strong Muslim populations.\xc2\xa0 And that happens to be the case with both Bosnia and Kosovo.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But, that said, we\'re also very much approaching the relationship with all three countries, in a sense, in and of themselves.\xc2\xa0 The missing piece in a Europe whole and free is exactly that part of Europe.\xc2\xa0 And to complete the picture, to complete the puzzle that many previous administrations have sought to complete and many countries in Europe have sought to complete of this Europe whole and free involves getting the Balkans right or, more accurately, helping the countries in the Balkans make progress and become strong, self-sustaining democracies.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And that\'s really, at heart, what this is about.\xc2\xa0 This is about completing that picture of a Europe whole and free.\xc2\xa0 This has been this piece.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made huge progress in -- since the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 But because I think we haven\'t been as focused on the Balkans in recent years, maybe some of the momentum, for example, in Bosnia has been lost or, in some cases, reversed.\xc2\xa0 Kosovo is newly independent.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an opportunity with Serbia, I think, to move the relationship in a very positive direction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So that\'s really the effort.\xc2\xa0 It\'s to complete that picture of a Europe whole and free.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, hi there.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you a little bit on this, but recently Saudi Arabia recognized Kosovo\'s independence.\xc2\xa0 What are you looking to see more from the Arab countries and the Muslim world on that issue, you know, diplomatic representations or other things?</div> <div class="legacy-para">And will the Vice President -- it\'s been rumored that he might overstop in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- can you make news here?\xc2\xa0 Will he be going to the Middle East during this visit, as well?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, in terms of the recognitions, I think Kosovo now has, when I last counted, about 58 countries that have recognized it.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Saudi recognition was extremely important and meaningful.\xc2\xa0 It should, I think, hopefully lead other countries to follow suit, and certainly that\'s something that we encourage.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But regardless of where recognition goes from here, in our judgment Kosovo\'s status as a sovereign, independent country is irreversible; that\'s not going to change.\xc2\xa0 And I think the international community increasingly is recognizing that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And then in terms of anything else, there are no plans for any other -- for anything else at this point on the trip.\xc2\xa0 So, unfortunately, I can\'t make news for you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think I\'ve got time for one more question, please.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Yes, just -- can you tell us what Vice President Biden might tell the Serb President Tadic about attitudes toward Serb -- between Serbia and Kosovo?\xc2\xa0 Will he ask the Serbs, for example, to soften their position, or will he have any specific recommendations?\xc2\xa0 And the final question is, is the Vice President going there, such a high-level official, going to the region because he fears the potential for instability down the road?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In terms of what the Vice President is likely to say to President Tadic and to the other leaders of Serbia that he meets, and particularly in terms of Kosovo, look, I think we\'re very realistic about this.\xc2\xa0 We need to find a modus vivendi on Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 And in a sense, I think we\'re going to have to agree to disagree.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t expect Belgrade to recognize Kosovo\'s independence.\xc2\xa0 But we do hope and expect that Belgrade will not do anything to undermine Kosovo and its efforts to build a strong, stable functioning multiethnic country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So that\'s the -- in a sense, that\'s where I think we have to head.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have unreasonable expectations of Belgrade.\xc2\xa0 I think we have reasonable expectations.\xc2\xa0 And in a sense, the real effort is to help convince our friends in Serbia to focus on the future and to focus on their country\'s future, because that future is potentially extraordinarily bright, given the history of Serbia, given the tremendous talent, given its central and essential role in the region and in Europe.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the focus that the Vice President hopes to bring to Serbia\'s leaders and to its people.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And there are specific things, in terms of just making, in a very practical sense, life -- daily life work well for all Kosovars, including the Serbs, the Kosovar Serbs.\xc2\xa0 He feels very strongly -- and he will make this very clear as well when he\'s in Kosovo -- about the absolute essential requirement that the rights of minorities be protected.\xc2\xa0 And that is a fundamental aspect of our policy.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ve seen the government in Kosovo act in a very responsible way, but he\'s going to reinforce that message.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But with President Tadic, it\'s really:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s move forward together.\xc2\xa0 We have an opportunity to reset and restart the relationship between the United States and Serbia.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we want.\xc2\xa0 That\'s where we want to go.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll find a way to, as I say, to move forward together, including on Kosovo.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  2:41 P.M.
