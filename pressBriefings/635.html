Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to wait for Ambassador Rice to finish her remarks before starting this briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Today I have with me at the top of this briefing the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor, Tony Blinken, whom many of you know.\xc2\xa0 Tony is here today because while many of us were traveling last week with the President, Tony and other senior administration officials were engaged in the effort to provide detailed information to members of Congress about the chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 He was a part of a group that provided classified briefings to I believe 185 members of the House and Senate, and is engaged in the overall outreach effort that so much of the administration is participating in now.</p>\n<p>So what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is ask Tony to provide to you at the top here a summation of the presentation that he\xe2\x80\x99s making, together with other officials.\xc2\xa0 And then he can stay and take a few questions, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to let him go to continue that effort and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions on Syria and other matters after that.</p>\n<p>With that, here\xe2\x80\x99s Tony Blinken.</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since the events of August 21st and this use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime against its own people, we reached out almost immediately to members of Congress, who at that point were spread across the country, and we sought their views on what we should do.\xc2\xa0 And we heard different views, as you continue to hear today.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things we heard with near unanimity was a desire by Congress to have its voice heard and its vote counted in this matter.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, the President believes that we\xe2\x80\x99re much stronger and more effective if we can act together, especially on matters of national security.</p>\n<p>So the President went out and made the announcement about his intent to take action, but also to seek Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to do so.\xc2\xa0 Since then, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in a very deliberate and detailed process of trying to provide Congress all of the information we have so that they can make the best informed decision possible.\xc2\xa0 And as Jay said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted over the past week or 10 days a series of briefings -- many of them classified, some of them unclassified -- many conversations, as well on an individual basis with members.</p>\n<p>The classified briefings that I took part in, along with senior officials from the intelligence community, the Defense Department, the State Department, and the Joint Chiefs, I believe had about 185 members -- Republicans and Democrats, both Houses<br/>\n\t-- take part.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had individual conversations coming out of those briefings as well.</p>\n<p>As we were doing that, we, of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re working to build strong international support.\xc2\xa0 The President at the G20 worked on a joint statement on the need to reinforce the prohibition against the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 At that time, 11 countries, including the United States, signed on.\xc2\xa0 We now have an additional 15 who joined that statement.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry was in Europe as well, working with Europeans and Arabs.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working every day at the United Nations and country by country.</p>\n<p>But in terms of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided Congress let me just describe the top lines of the briefings -- obviously I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the classified part.\xc2\xa0 But the bottom line, as told Congress in these briefings, is that we concluded with high confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on August 21st with rockets and artillery against its own civilians.\xc2\xa0 We told them that we concluded that well over a thousand have been killed, including hundreds of children.</p>\n<p>We ran through in detail the intelligence that we have -- intelligence that shows preparation for the attack; intelligence that shows the attack itself and its effects; post-attack observations by key participants; and then more recently, various physiological samples -- blood, skin, as well as soil -- that show that sarin was used.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also been, as you all know, an extraordinary body of contemporaneous public information that\'s come out about this incident -- videos, social media, much of which has been shown recently on television, eyewitness accounts, reports from NGOs, from doctors, from hospitals, from other countries.\xc2\xa0 And all of this taken together, we told Congress, led us to the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Assad had poisoned his own people with gas on August 21st.</p>\n<p>We made the case that it was very important to stand up for the international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons, a prohibition that I think all of you know has been in place basically since the end of World War I.\xc2\xa0 We saw the terrible effects of poison gas being used on soldiers in World War I.\xc2\xa0 The Geneva Protocol emerged saying you can\'t do this again.\xc2\xa0 One of the very positive benefits of that is that since World War I, not a single U.S. soldier on the battlefield has been exposed to poison gas.</p>\n<p>And, of course, we noted for Congress its own strong stances in the recent past on this prohibition -- the Senate overwhelmingly passing the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, both houses of Congress overwhelmingly passing the Syria Accountability Act in 2003.\xc2\xa0 That was motivated in part by concern that Syria had chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 Now Syria has used them.</p>\n<p>We made the case that enforcing this prohibition and this norm is profoundly in the national interest, first and foremost, to deter Assad from using these weapons again and making it more difficult for him to do so; to prevent the threshold against use from dropping lower, lower and lower to the point where our own soldiers and citizens could well be exposed; to make a political settlement in Syria more likely, not less likely; and of course to stop the threat to the neighbors, including Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq, which as Secretary Kerry said about a week ago, are just a stiff breeze away from Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, finally, we made the case because others are watching.\xc2\xa0 Iran is watching what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 North Korea is watching what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 Hezbollah is watching what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 If we don\'t stand up and enforce this prohibition, they will take the wrong lesson from it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Many members asked how what we proposed to do fit into our larger strategy for Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we explained that as we act to deal with the chemical weapons problem, it\'s in the context of a broader strategy that we\'ve been pursuing for some time to try and bring the civil war in Syria to an end, to a negotiated political transition.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\'s the best way to do it because it offers the greatest prospect for their not being a vacuum after Assad leaves that could be filled by things as bad, if not worse, and also the best prospect for keeping the country and its institutions together.</p>\n<p>And so that broader strategy to deal with the underlying conflict has involved putting pressure on the Assad regime, isolating it, denying it resources.\xc2\xa0 It\'s involved building up the opposition.\xc2\xa0 It\'s involved a humanitarian program, the largest in the world by any single country.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s involved a diplomatic track to get agreement on basically what the principles for a political transition would look like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we\'re proposing to do to deal with the use of chemical weapons on August 21st is taking place in the context of that larger strategy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s separate from it, but it\'s happening simultaneous to it.\xc2\xa0 And of course, the primary objective of the force that we propose to use is to deter Assad from using the weapons again, is to degrade his ability to do so.\xc2\xa0 But it could also have the additional benefit of advancing the broader strategy of ending the civil war by making it clear to Assad that we can hold at risk things that he holds very dear.</p>\n<p>Finally, the last two points that we made in our briefings to Congress, along with some of the -- again, the details of the intelligence and some of the military plan that we\'re looking at, is we thought it was very important to say what this is and what this isn\xe2\x80\x99t, because what we found in our engagement with members is that many of them had just returned from their home states and their home districts, and they were going to state fairs, they were going to town halls, and they were hearing from their constituents.\xc2\xa0 And it is perfectly normal and understandable that when an American hears in the news a headline, or on television hears military action in Syria, they immediately think of the last 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The frame that they process that through is a decade of war -- Iraq, Afghanistan -- 100,000 American troops in one, 150,000 American troops in the other.</p>\n<p>So we made it very clear to the members of Congress we were engaged with what this is and what this isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 What this is, is a limited, tailored, but effective military action to deal with the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 What it is not is open-ended.\xc2\xa0 It is not boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not Iraq.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not even Libya.</p>\n<p>Finally, the case we made to members of Congress involved balancing the risks of action against the risks of inaction.\xc2\xa0 We made it clear that there are always risks in taking military action, and we spend many hours trying to game them out, to take steps to prevent them, and to mitigate them.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s our judgment that the consequences of inaction are much greater and graver still.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If we don\xe2\x80\x99t act, the international norm against the use of chemical weapons would be dangerously weakened.\xc2\xa0 The threshold for the use of these weapons would get lower and lower. The message to Assad would be that he can act with impunity -- and he\xe2\x80\x99ll do it again.\xc2\xa0 It would make a political settlement in Syria less likely.\xc2\xa0 It would send a message to our partners and allies that we don\xe2\x80\x99t mean what we say.\xc2\xa0 And it would send a message to Iran, North Korea, and other groups that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to pursue and indeed even use these weapons with impunity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the case we made.\xc2\xa0 And we, of course, asked Congress to support a limited but decisive response to the use of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>And let me stop with that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll start with a few questions for Tony.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing this today.\xc2\xa0 One of the other questions that some lawmakers have is whether the President plans to proceed with a strike regardless of how they vote.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take sort of a meaningless vote here.\xc2\xa0 And you said over the weekend that it\xe2\x80\x99s neither the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire, nor his intention to use his authority without congressional backing. Do you stand by that statement that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- he has no intention of striking without congressional authority?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 So I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that, again, we heard at the very outset in our earliest consultations with members of Congress that they wanted their voices heard and their votes counted in this.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that the President went to Congress, because he believes we\xe2\x80\x99re stronger when we act together.\xc2\xa0 And we heard clearly from them, including a letter signed by nearly 200 members of Congress early on that they wanted to be in on this debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to jump ahead of the process.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t speak very artfully.\xc2\xa0 The President -- it is clearly his desire and intent to secure the support of Congress for this action, but I don\'t want to get into any hypotheticals about what will or will not happen after the vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily standing by that?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in jumping ahead of where we are now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tony, as you gather more evidence, this physiological evidence that you said, have you moved passed having simply a high degree of confidence to 100 percent certitude that this happened?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand.\xc2\xa0 The intelligence community has different levels of confidence that it expresses in any given assessment:\xc2\xa0 low, medium and high.\xc2\xa0 High is as high as they can go.\xc2\xa0 They will not tell you with 100 percent guarantee that anything has happened in terms of the assessment that they make.\xc2\xa0 They put together the facts, and we have certitude in the facts, and you put those facts together and you make an assessment, and then you evaluate that assessment, you grade it. And their grade is \xe2\x80\x9chigh confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>That is well beyond \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a standard that I think many Americans are familiar with, and that is the standard that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been using.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tony, did this decision go all the way up to Assad himself?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Assad, we believe and we have the intelligence and evidence to back this up, is in control of the chemical weapons program and would have -- let me put it this way -- any standing orders to use these weapons would have been issued by Assad.\xc2\xa0 And our colleagues in the intelligence community showed in great detail the different individuals in the chain of command who were engaged in the activities of August 21st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tony, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Charlie Rose interviewed President Assad and said several things.\xc2\xa0 I won\'t go all through them.\xc2\xa0 But among the things he said, there will be repercussions if there is a United States military strike, and that the United States should be fearful of that -- direct and indirect repercussions.\xc2\xa0 He made a couple of veiled references to 9/11.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like get your reaction to that.</p>\n<p>Secondly, today the Syrians and the Russians have announced this concept of international supervision and control of or maintenance of the chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Or is that something that the administration would regard as a favorable move, or not?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And lastly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had the briefings, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost ground in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 There are more Senate Democrats saying they don\'t want to support this than do.\xc2\xa0 Why are you losing ground?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 First question with regard to Assad\xe2\x80\x99s comments, let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we take every possible precaution to make sure that we can prevent and defend against anything that might arise from the use of military action, and we\'ve done that and will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 And it is our judgment that President Assad and Syria would have very little interest in picking a fight with the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think that is likely at all.</p>\n<p>Second, with regard to the reports today about this Russian initiative, we have seen the reports.\xc2\xa0 We want to take a hard look at the proposal.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll obviously discuss the idea with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we would welcome a decision and action by Syria to give up its chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 The whole point of what we\'re doing is to stop Syria from using these weapons again.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep a few things in mind.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the international community has tried for 20 years to get Syria to sign on to the Chemical Weapons Convention, joining 189 other countries in doing so.\xc2\xa0 Now it is one of only five countries that haven\'t done it.\xc2\xa0 And just last week President Assad wouldn\'t even say whether he had chemical weapons despite overwhelming evidence he\xe2\x80\x99s actually used them --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, in the interview --</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, exactly.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we\'ve also tried to work with the Russians at the United Nations repeatedly on Syria and chemical weapons for months.\xc2\xa0 And until now they have blocked all of our initiatives including simple press statements, never mind a Security Council resolution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s the background.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that Syria has one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world; it\xe2\x80\x99s spread across the country.\xc2\xa0 It would certainly take time, resources, and probably a peaceful environment to deal with this.</p>\n<p>All of that said, we\'re going to take a hard look at this.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll talk to the Russians about it.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to note that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that this proposal comes in the context of the threat of U.S. action and the pressure that the President is exerting.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s even more important that we don\'t take the pressure off and that Congress give the President the authority he\xe2\x80\x99s requested.</p>\n<p>Finally, in terms of where we are with Congress, my sense is this from all these briefings -- my sense is that when members of Congress have a chance to see the intelligence, to read it, to get the briefings, to ask questions, they come away convinced of two things:\xc2\xa0 Chemical weapons were used on August 21st against civilians in Syria, and the Assad regime is the one that used them.\xc2\xa0 Many, many members have yet to get this classified brief. And now, as they\xe2\x80\x99re coming back today and this week, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 And we have senior officials going out to provide the same briefing we gave last week.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that when they see the evidence, it is compelling, it\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming.</p>\n<p>And then it comes down to a pretty basic question:\xc2\xa0 Are we or are we not going to do anything about the fact that Assad poisoned his own people with gas, including hundreds of children? That\xe2\x80\x99s the question before the members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And when they have the evidence, when they see the facts, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the right conclusion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you\xe2\x80\x99re taking a hard look -- the administration is taking a hard look at what the Russians have offered.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that the Secretary of State, when he mentioned this idea in Britain earlier today, that that was a proposal coming from this administration?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no -- we literally just heard about this as you did some hours ago.\xc2\xa0 So we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to look at it yet.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to the Russians about it yet.\xc2\xa0 We will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that the Secretary said that Assad could turn it over, all of it, without delay.\xc2\xa0 That was not -- I mean, that seemed to set off this --</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he was speaking -- I believe he was answering questions, speaking hypothetically about what if Assad were to do this.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, we would welcome Assad giving up his chemical weapons, doing it in a verifiable manner, so that we can account for them and destroy them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole purpose of what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve -- to make sure that he can\xe2\x80\x99t use them again.\xc2\xa0 That would be terrific.</p>\n<p>But, unfortunately, the track record to date, including recent statements by Assad not even acknowledging that he has chemical weapons, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give you a lot of confidence.\xc2\xa0 But that said, we want to look hard at what the Russians have proposed, and we will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure -- so is this an ultimatum coming from this White House to Bashar al-Assad?\xc2\xa0 This is an escape hatch for him?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Again, we will look at what the Russians have proposed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to them about it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where it goes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can, just within the last hour, Susan Rice said that failing to respond would increase instability in that region.\xc2\xa0 For a lot of Americans, the concern is that the opposite would take place.\xc2\xa0 In fact, if we did respond, that would create further instability in the region.\xc2\xa0 How can you assure Americans and Congress members that that\xe2\x80\x99s not what would take place -- there would be further instability if we took action?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 I think the case is very compelling that a failure to take action would produce all sorts of very, very negative consequences in terms of the interests of countries in the region, many of whom are our partners and allies, and in terms of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First and foremost, we know with some degree of certitude that the failure to take action would say to Assad, you can use these weapons again and again and again, and do it with impunity. And the more you have chemical weapons used in Syria, the chances of it spilling over to other countries and affecting them, eventually affecting us, goes higher and higher.</p>\n<p>Second, as you know, we have a real concern that countries that either have these kinds of weapons or aspire to get them will watch, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t take action, they\xe2\x80\x99ll conclude that they can seek to acquire them and, indeed, use them with impunity.\xc2\xa0 So all of that adds to the level of risk and danger and threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of taking action, again, what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to understand:\xc2\xa0 This is limited, it\xe2\x80\x99s focused, but we believe effective in terms of telling Assad, don\xe2\x80\x99t use this again, and also making it more difficult for him to do so in a very practical way.\xc2\xa0 It is not going to war with Syria.\xc2\xa0 It is not Iraq.\xc2\xa0 It is not Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I think the chances of the action we propose to take leading to greater instability are very, very, very small.\xc2\xa0 To the contrary, a failure to act offers the real prospect of greater instability.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then for Americans that fear after the first few days of strikes -- these limited, targeted, though effective strikes -- what happens on day four, five, and six?\xc2\xa0 What is the plan in that vacuum that could be created as a result?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into the details or the plan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to get into this with members of Congress in a classified setting.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, they have to make a judgment.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the people\xe2\x80\x99s representatives.\xc2\xa0 And I wish we could go into more detail with everyone, but that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have elected representatives.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s their responsibility to make that judgment as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Putin discuss this with the President in St. Petersburg -- this idea of international control of the chemical weapons stockpiles?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 So I was not in St. Petersburg.\xc2\xa0 I was back home, so I defer that to Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Perfect segue.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Tony.</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, in answer to your question, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having conversations with the Russians for a long time about the chemical weapons in Syria, the threat they pose to the region, especially in an environment as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Syria of civil conflict and war.\xc2\xa0 And this has been an ongoing conversation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific conversation to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the pull-aside in St. Petersburg?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more of a readout of that conversation than we provided so far except to say that Syria was, as it has been for quite some time, a subject of conversation between the two leaders and all the various counterparts who have engaged in conversation between the U.S. and the Russians over these past several weeks and months.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tony wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but can you explain why the American people should believe -- absent the classified information you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give us -- that you can effectively persuade Bashar al-Assad not to use chemical weapons again with a military strike without targeting the chemical weapons stockpiles?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we can say, Wendell, is that in a effective but limited way, we can degrade Assad\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities -- specifically his capabilities to deploy again chemical weapons, and make clear to Assad the significant consequences of using those weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, within the context of some of the questions that Tony just answered, that the only reason why we have a dynamic today where the Russians have proffered a proposal and there\xe2\x80\x99s been some response from the Syrians with regards to stockpiles of chemical weapons that they have heretofore not even acknowledged they have is because of the intense pressure being placed on Assad by the prospect of the United States engaging in military force in response to Assad\xe2\x80\x99s use of chemical weapons against his own people on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it is so important to continue to put that pressure on Assad and to make clear to him that a prohibition that has been in place in many ways for a hundred years should not be violated without consequence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when you talk about not putting forth classified information -- of course, there is some information that we cannot, but there has been an enormous amount of information put forward to members of Congress and the public, and that is continuing to this day, that demonstrate that chemical weapons were used on August 21st to horrifying effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I really think it is something that everyone should do -- every adult, certainly, should do who has a concern about this -- to view those images that were shown over the weekend and I believe are available now, that demonstrate the horrific consequences of that attack on civilians and, in particular, children, and then ask themselves if they agree, as every member of Congress who\xe2\x80\x99s had this briefing agrees, that chemical weapons were used on August 21st and that the Assad regime is responsible, and that that is in violation of a longstanding international prohibition -- should we do something about it?\xc2\xa0 Should there be consequences for it?\xc2\xa0 And if not, what the result of that inaction would be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow that.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying, then, that this proposal the Russians have announced to try and pressure Assad to put his chemical weapons under international supervision is a result of the U.S. determination, the U.S. push for military action?\xc2\xa0 And in light of that, how do you respond to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it has very explicitly been stated --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can finish -- from lawmakers who say that the President got to this too late?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The use of chemical weapons on a wide-scale basis occurred on August 21st, a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 The President decided that it was entirely appropriate in a circumstance like this to seek authorization from Congress, because we are stronger and more effective when we act in a unified manner.\xc2\xa0 So I do not think that this has been a question of responding too slowly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In fact, in response to, as Tony said, the demands and suggestions of members of Congress that their voices be heard and their votes be counted, the President agreed.\xc2\xa0 And we have engaged in an effort to present facts to members of Congress so that they can make their own assessment about whether or not this international prohibition should be backed up, and that a violation of it should have consequences, because as Tony just said in response to Peter, the alternative is greater instability.\xc2\xa0 If there are no consequences, Assad gets the message that he\xe2\x80\x99s free to use these weapons going forward.\xc2\xa0 And what you have potentially is an unraveling of that international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons with potentially even more devastating consequences in the region and the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Russian proposal growing out of this push for military action?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it has been explicitly stated by Russian officials that this is an effort to avert action being taken by the United States with the support of many nations and hopefully with the support of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And so I think it\'s explicitly in reaction to the threat of a retaliation for this use of chemical weapons against civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mara, and then Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, John McCain, who\xe2\x80\x99s been one of your real allies in this, joined the kind of chorus of critics of your lobbying effort.\xc2\xa0 And specifically, he took exception to Secretary Kerry\'s remark that the strike would be "unbelievably small."\xc2\xa0 He said that was "unbelievably unhelpful."\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what Kerry meant by saying it was "unbelievably small"?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly.\xc2\xa0 I think that Secretary Kerry clearly was referring to that in the context of what the United States and the American people have experienced over this past 10, 12 years, which includes large-scale, long-term, and as it seemed at least prior to President Obama coming into office, open-ended military engagements with boots on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is the contrast that Secretary Kerry was making.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that the phrasing reflects some error.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a fact that by comparison this is certainly much more limited and of a smaller duration and size.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wasn\'t talking about the results with the "unbelievably small."\xc2\xa0 He was talking about the operation itself, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We said very clearly that if implemented that the action would in important ways degrade Assad\'s capabilities and certainly deter him from further use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait, Jay, are you saying -- does the White House\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I did call on Julie.\xc2\xa0 And then I\'ll get to you.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we all get that this chemical weapons security proposal from the Russians may be an effort on their part to try to avert military action.\xc2\xa0 But I think the question is, is it also a U.S. effort to try to avert military action?\xc2\xa0 Did John Kerry purposefully raise this possibility this morning as a way to try to find another option here besides a strike?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you can accept that it is our position, and has been for some time, that the Syrian regime not only should not use but should not possess stockpiles of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we would welcome any development -- and would have for some time now -- that would result in the international control of and destruction of Syria\'s chemical weapons stockpile. What I think you\'re seeing in a very fluid environment is with the threat of military action, Syria and Russia -- which has clearly been an ally of Syria -- coming up with potential proposals that might, if implemented, avert military action.</p>\n<p>Now, I think it\'s important to say that we will study this. We will work with the Russians and speak with them.\xc2\xa0 But it is also important to note, of course, that we would have some skepticism about the Assad regime\'s credibility -- as was noted by Major I think, even as recently as in the last 24 hours Assad has refused to even acknowledge that he possesses chemical weapons, which, of course, the whole world knows that he does.\xc2\xa0 The whole world knows that he uses them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was this a coordinated thing today with Kerry saying this, as far as raising this possibility and then the Russians coming out with a proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I think what I will only say is that there are ongoing conversations on this matter at the highest levels, and obviously that includes conversations with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 And we will study that proposal that, as Tony said, has just come forward and see if there is action that can be taken upon it.</p>\n<p>But we have to be mindful of the failure of the Assad regime for so long now, 20 years, to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention; for the last several years to allow for -- or at least the last year -- to allow for U.N. inspectors until the last moment in the wake of the August 21st attack, and only then after they stalled U.N. inspectors for days while they bombarded the neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a history of promises being kept.</p>\n<p>Having said that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly look at this and we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly discuss it with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 It is important to note, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, that we would not be having this conversation, that any positive reaction to the suggestion that they would forsake their chemical weapons by the Syrian government would never have been forthcoming if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the fact that there is the credible threat of U.S. military action in response to their use of those weapons.</p>\n<p>Jon, I think I said, and then Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, so to follow up on both those -- would the administration be willing to delay military action while taking a hard look at this Russian proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have discussions with the Russians. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have discussions with others.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary General has made some statements today that are related in the broader sense to this disposition of Syrian chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we are engaged in an effort to discuss and provide information -- discuss with and provide information to lawmakers here in Congress, as many more of them make their way back to Washington, and avail themselves of the kinds of briefings that Tony discussed in our effort to secure authorization from Congress.\xc2\xa0 So this is not -- this effort is ongoing, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that on a parallel track, that conversations will take place with Russians and others with regards to this possible proposal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was that a yes, that while you\xe2\x80\x99re having -- would the administration delay military action while taking a hard look at this proposal, while having those discussions you just -- I mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to start bombing Syria while you\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating with the Russians, are you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re spinning forward here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve just had a proposal articulated by the Russians with a response of sorts by the Syrian Foreign Minister, as reported anyway, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll engage in conversations about that.\xc2\xa0 But we are -- in terms of military action, we are obviously engaged with Congress at this point.\xc2\xa0 So while we have these discussions with the Russians and others, we will continue in the effort with Congress.</p>\n<p>I think I said Scott -- Jon and then Scott, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this notion of an \xe2\x80\x9cunbelievably small effort\xe2\x80\x9d were the words of the Secretary of State -- does the White House stand by that characterization that this would be an unbelievably small effort?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important here -- and this goes to I think Julie\xe2\x80\x99s first question, too, to Tony Blinken -- that you guys -- we\xe2\x80\x99re spending a lot of time making the case in public and with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear what that case is.\xc2\xa0 You can focus on phrases that a senator might take issue with, but you know exactly what Secretary Kerry was referring to, just as I think Tony made clear what he was referring to in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The size and scope of the contemplated military action is small in comparison to what we have been engaged in, in this country for the past dozen years -- large-scale, open-ended military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with enormous costs to military families, enormous sacrifice and bravery and courage, and obviously enormous financial cost.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President committed, when he ran for office, to end the war in Iraq responsibly, and he has done that.\xc2\xa0 He has committed\xc2\xa0 -- after making sure that we focused in an appropriate way on the effort in Afghanistan, and that included plusing up our forces -- to winding down that war, and he is keeping that commitment.</p>\n<p>This is something quite different.\xc2\xa0 This is a response to the violation of an international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons that would be limited in scope, would involve no boots on the ground -- no American troops serving on the ground in Syria -- in an operation that would be limited in scope and duration, but would have a specific impact on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities, in response to this abominable violation of the international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we would engage with the Russians and with others in the effort to bring about the only possible outcome in Syria in terms of the civil war, and that is a political settlement.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the need to act now to deter future chemical weapons use.\xc2\xa0 Is there regret inside the White House that a swifter, more forceful White House response the last time chemical weapons were used in Syria eight months ago may have deterred this use this time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a significant difference in terms of the size and scope and impact of the use that we saw on August 21st and the prior instances that we assessed and the intelligence community assessed with high confidence represented the use of these weapons by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And it is because of the overwhelming scope of this use -- the amount of chemical weapons used, the breadth of the consequences when it comes to civilian casualties -- that it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view and the view of many others that this must be responded to, that Assad has to be held accountable.</p>\n<p>And in response to those earlier uses, we obviously took action, as did other members of the international community, in terms of stepping up our assistance to the Syrian opposition, including the military opposition.\xc2\xa0 But this case is obviously far more egregious, as anybody who has seen those videos and other evidence knows.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not so much comparing apples to apples.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer to your question is, no, we obviously took action in response to those much smaller-scale uses of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 This is qualitatively, in the most horrific way --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was handled correctly and would not have been able to prevent this no matter how you reacted?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that we took appropriate action then. And in seeking congressional authorization for limited military now, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the right thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You made a slight reference to this earlier.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Secretary General is thinking about taking this to the Security Council of transferring Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons to safe sites where they can be stored and destroyed.\xc2\xa0 Is that something you want?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was just simply responding to the fact that the Secretary General, as I saw on television before I came out here, was also discussing the issue of the disposition of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpile, to say that these conversations are taking place in the context of the threat of U.S. military action in response to the use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians in Syria on a massive scale that led to the agonizing deaths of more than 1,400 people, including more than 400 children.</p>\n<p>How this plays out will obviously depend on the conversations we have with the Russians and the level of seriousness in response to those proposals that the Syrian government brings to the discussions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a great history here when it comes to Syrian credibility or the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s credibility.\xc2\xa0 But we would certainly discuss this with the Russians as well as with the Secretary General.</p>\n<p>Let me give others -- Major and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the back, Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want Congress to wait while you assess the credibility of this Russian-Syrian proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 As I think Tony said and others have said even in the last couple of hours, that it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because of the process we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken in enlisting international support and the process we are undertaking in making the case to members of Congress, and the resulting threat of military force that that has produced, we are seeing these proposals, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing this potential avenue put forward.\xc2\xa0 And it is because that pressure exists that we cannot let up in applying that pressure.\xc2\xa0 And we need to make clear to Assad, as well as the Russians and others, that we\xe2\x80\x99re very serious about the need to respond to the violation of this important prohibition.</p>\n<p>And we also need to make clear that there are consequences to inaction when it comes to our national security:\xc2\xa0 more instability in the region; the threat of further use of chemical weapons; the threat of proliferation of these weapons around the region and the world; and the signal that failing to hold Assad accountable would send to Tehran and Hezbollah and other potential bad actors when it comes to the use of these kinds of weapons.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only reason I ask is, as you know, Senator Manchin and Senator Heitkamp had this proposal -- I asked the President about it in St. Petersburg on Friday -- about a 45-day period to give the Syrians a chance to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, hand over their chemical weapon stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 These things now appear to be merging in public.\xc2\xa0 Is that an alternative that the administration would support?\xc2\xa0 Or would it prefer the Senate only deal with the authorization before it and consider no other matters?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer to specific timetables in the Senate to the Senate Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 What we are focused on is making the substantive case to lawmakers, as well as to the public -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in a broad effort from the President on down to do that -- about what happened on August 21st, the incontrovertible fact that weapons were used that night -- chemical weapons were used that night to horrifying effect, and the fact that beyond a reasonable doubt, the Assad regime was responsible for the use of chemical weapons on that night, and we need to -- as a matter of our own national security interest\xc2\xa0 -- take action, with the support of many nations around the world and with the support of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re making the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 To the degree you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of it, Charlie Rose had this interview with Assad.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on some of the many things that Assad said about his regime, about his chemical weapons, about other elements of possible repercussions if there are attacks?\xc2\xa0 Has the President been made aware or briefed on the contents?\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from Assad in this kind of extensive format. I wonder if you had any overall assessments or to the degree the President has been briefed.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, obviously, is being briefed regularly on situations with regard -- with matters with regard to the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically what he was briefed on when it came to the Assad interview, but I\xe2\x80\x99m very confident he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What Tony said in terms of the threat of repercussions is what I will echo, which is that we obviously assess what kind of reactions or actions might be taken in response to the kind of action we\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating.\xc2\xa0 I think Tony\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that we do not believe it would be -- that the Assad regime would view it as in their interest to engage in a war with the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or Hezbollah.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s true there, too.\xc2\xa0 But we will take every precaution necessary.\xc2\xa0 We are very confident that we are more than capable of responding to or handling any reaction to that action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last Friday, Samantha Power said that the administration had exhausted all alternatives to military force in regards to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the administration has exhausted all alternatives to military force?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have spent the two years that there has been a civil war in Syria engaging the international community, trying to get the United Nations Security Council to act and hold Assad accountable.\xc2\xa0 Russia and China have blocked those efforts. We have worked in a concerted way with the opposition and with many partners around the world in providing support to the moderate opposition, as well as significant humanitarian relief to the Syrian people who have been so horribly affected by this conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to the use of chemical weapons, we have made clear again and again to the Assad regime -- from the President on down -- that there would be consequences.\xc2\xa0 And there must be consequences for the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And that was deliberate because it was -- in our view, it would be a terrible thing, a terrible precedent if Assad were to use those weapons in this conflict.\xc2\xa0 Now he has done so, and he has done so on a massive scale with all the horror as a result that we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 Now, that is why we are where we are, and that is why the President has been making this case internationally and why he has been making this case domestically.</p>\n<p>We will obviously, in response to what we\'ve talked about here, assess proposals put forward by the Russians, assess other proposals.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is Assad used these weapons against his own people, murdering more than 1,400 -- including more than 400 children.\xc2\xa0 And if everyone acknowledges that that\'s the case, as every lawmaker who has had this briefing has acknowledged is the case, then the question only becomes, should there be consequences for that.\xc2\xa0 And that is the question we\'re asking every lawmaker as they contemplate this vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the answer is, no, you haven\'t exhausted all --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\'re reviewing the Russian proposal, then you\'re essentially saying that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When she said that, the Russian proposal hadn\'t been proffered.\xc2\xa0 I think it was proffered in the last couple of hours.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So what I\'m asking is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m asking has that changed.\xc2\xa0 Is your view right now -- the White House\'s view -- that you have exhausted all other options besides the military force, or you haven\'t?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ve answered this question -- because there is now this new statement by the Russians, the Foreign Minister, as well as a response by the Syrian Foreign Minister, and we are going to study it and engage with the Russians and others on it.\xc2\xa0 But we must continue to keep the pressure on the Assad regime with the threat of U.S. military action, because it is precisely that threat that has even led to this kind of proposal.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s clear to anybody who is watching this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Emel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nadia.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nadia, sorry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see the Syrian government acceptance of the Russian proposal as an admission from the Syrian government they actually have chemical weapons?\xc2\xa0 Because they never admitted it before?\xc2\xa0 And, second, a spokesman for the Syrian opposition dismissed the Russian proposal as a gimmick.\xc2\xa0 And the State Department already says that they have doubts about the Russian proposal.\xc2\xa0 What the White House is saying now is that they\'re willing to give it a consideration.\xc2\xa0 Is this contradictory?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve made clear that we\'re highly skeptical of the credibility of the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 And I think that as early as this morning, at least when it was broadcast, and so I think within the last couple of days, Bashar al-Assad would not even acknowledge that his country had stockpiles of chemical weapons, let alone acknowledge that his regime used them on multiple occasions, most significantly on August 21st.</p>\n<p>So that is just the beginning of a case for why there should be ample skepticism -- and there is.\xc2\xa0 But there is no question, because of the potential for U.S. military action, that we have seen some at least indications of a potential acceptance of this proposal.\xc2\xa0 But this is a very early stage.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re obviously going to discuss this with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously going to study it.\xc2\xa0 But we will do so with a certain amount of skepticism, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>And I think the response that I\'ve seen anyway, the public response that I\'ve seen from the Syrian government, the Assad government, so far falls fairly short of even acknowledging that they have these weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The German government seems also to be on board with the Russian proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The German government seems to be on board with the Russians in the same proposal that apparently has been discussed during the G20, that actually there is a political solution whereby Assad will exit before 2014 election, which is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s separate from --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to the chemical weapons</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, so you\'re talking about -- there\'s the matter of the use of chemical weapons and the disposition of the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile.\xc2\xa0 Separate from that, there is an ongoing effort -- and we work with the Russians on this -- within the context of the Geneva system that has been in place where we are trying to bring about a political resolution to the Syrian conflict.\xc2\xa0 That is the only resolution achievable that would allow for the Syrian state to remain in place, for institutions to remain in place, and that would allow for a semblance of stability in the aftermath of this conflict.</p>\n<p>And it is our strongly held view that a leader who has massacred his own people, and who has gone so far as to fire chemical weapons -- sarin gas -- and gassed his own people to death has long ago forsaken any opportunity or credibility he might have to continue to lead his people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that is -- we are absolutely engaged in that process, and we have had that discussion and will continue to have that discussion with the Russians, as well as many other nations that understand that the only resolution to this conflict in the long term has to be through a political negotiation.</p>\n<p>Alexis, and then Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just follow up on two things?\xc2\xa0 Can I just clarify -- for those senators who are either unsure right now how they would vote this week, or reluctant to vote for approval based on the resolution they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far, and they come and they talk to the administration and they\'re interested in this potential avenue that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described here that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, what is the White House going to tell them if they say they\xe2\x80\x99d like to know more about the outcome of that potential avenue before they cast a vote this week?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the answer?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again I think we need to note, as Tony did, that this proposal has only recently been put forward, first of all.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to study it, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to speak with the Russians, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll speak with others about it and assess it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Two, we will explain to lawmakers -- and I think it a fairly easy case to make -- that the only reason why we are seeing this proposal is because of the threat of U.S. military action in response to Assad\xe2\x80\x99s use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 Heretofore, the Russians have not been very helpful when it comes to -- at all helpful when it comes to holding Assad accountable for either his use of chemical weapons or his wholesale slaughter of his own people.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, the Assad regime has not been cooperative when it comes to U.N. inspections into their use of chemical weapons or even acknowledging the fact that they have these stockpiles, let alone that they used them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it is precisely because of this very public discussion and presentation of evidence we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in, and because of the accumulating international support for action, and the pressure that all of that has brought to bear on Assad and the Russians and others, that we are seeing this.\xc2\xa0 So we will make the case to lawmakers that we need to keep the pressure up for that reason.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to follow up, you would want them to cast their vote without knowing exactly how this plays out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think to -- yes, because the vote -- the authorization continues to put pressure on Assad and is the only reason why a proposition like this would have any chance of bearing fruit.\xc2\xa0 If Assad believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s no threat of retaliation for his use of chemical weapons, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that he will suddenly volunteer to give them up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second follow-up or question was, in referring to the discussions with the Russians about the potential avenue, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- what would prevent the President of the United States right now issuing an ultimatum of his own to Assad, to the Syrian regime, and saying, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to see, do this on this timetable, follow it out, follow it through?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now is reaction to the possibility of a U.S. military action and a proposal put forward by the Russians, and we will study it and engage with the Russians, as well as others, to see how serious it is and how credible the Syrian reaction is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we need to make sure that we keep the pressure on, through the engagement with the international community that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken and through the case that we\xe2\x80\x99re making to both Congress and the American people about why in a very limited way but an effective way we must respond to the use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just talk a little bit about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech? Obviously, you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us copies yet, but could you just talk about -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a few polls in the last day or two that show the American people are -- many are opposed, a lot of people not paying attention, not sure what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t release classified information, so what can he share with them tomorrow that might help them understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question and I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, it is entirely understandable that the American people and their representatives would be and are weary and wary of military engagement.\xc2\xa0 They have every reason to be after the sustained military action that this country has taken over the past dozen years.\xc2\xa0 As a starting point, that is an entirely understandable place to be.</p>\n<p>I think that, while we here in Washington all consume high quantities of the same information all the time, and we hear all of you who cover him, and all of us who work with him and for him hear the President make this case, and think, well, then, everybody has heard it -- the fact is, as you noted, many people haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And they may know only the headline they read or the snippet they heard on the news that President Obama is making the case for a military strike in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that, understandably, might raise some concern, given where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been over these past 12 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is why it is important, A, to make the case about what happened; about the horrific consequences of the use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians in Syria, including children; about why this is in our national security interest to respond to make sure that this prohibition against chemical weapons use is maintained; and why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have the Congress join the President in support of that action.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people will hear from the President tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what those who heard him in his press conference the other day heard him say, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what, when he gives interviews, they\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him say again.\xc2\xa0 And we understand that we need to make the case and explain the facts more than once, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to reach as many people as we can.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be undertaking today, tomorrow and beyond as we engage with Congress and the American public and the international community on this issue.</p>\n<p>Jen, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it would be legal to launch a military strike in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you saw that Kathy Ruemmler addressed this is in an article today.\xc2\xa0 The answer is, yes, in a legitimate response.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is the President believes that congressional authorization enhances the argument; that it\xe2\x80\x99s important in this case, because of the facts based on the assessment given by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that we can act militarily in a day or a week or a month, as the President said, and have the desired impact that we seek.\xc2\xa0 And, therefore, given that, he felt it was very important to get congressional approval.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s also made clear that he believes he has the authority as Commander-in-Chief and President to take action.\xc2\xa0 But we are better and stronger if we, in these circumstances, seek and receive authorization from Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate,\xe2\x80\x9d you mean legal?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point you to what White House Counsel said, since she addressed this and others have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously -- I mean, we have a circumstance here, because Assad is a client of the Russians, that we have not been able to achieve action from the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And it simply cannot be the case that in a circumstance like that, a violation of a prohibition against chemical weapons use should be ignored with all the consequences of ignoring that.\xc2\xa0 And so the President is making his case.</p>\n<p>We obviously have received international support for taking action, and that international support continues to increase.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very mindful of and we understand the weariness about this kind of action in the public and in Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re making the case that we\xe2\x80\x99re making.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, all.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:24 P.M.
