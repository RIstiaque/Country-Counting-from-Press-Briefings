Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:28 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I apologize for that -- scheduling is a complicated business, and a lot of moving parts here in the West Wing of the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell us about them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any personnel --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be telling --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you got?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- let me begin, if I may.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to mention this yesterday and forgot, and I just wanted to offer my condolences to Tony Blankley\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xc2\xa0 I knew him reasonably well -- we spent a lot of time in green rooms together -- a very decent gentleman and smart man who served both the Reagan administration and then Speaker Newt Gingrich well.\xc2\xa0 And we will miss him -- I will, personally.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would also like to say a few things about the united -- the American automobile industry.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the North American International Auto Show kicked off in Detroit, Michigan, with companies unveiling their new vehicles and folks eager to get their first peak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood was on hand for the opening events, and Commerce Secretary John Bryson, Energy Secretary Steven Chu, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, and the Labor Department\xe2\x80\x99s Director of the Office of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers Jay Williams are all taking part in auto show activities this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the auto show is a reminder to me -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure to you -- of the fact that in the face of stiff opposition, the President made a tough choice to help provide the auto industry with the temporary support it needed to rebuild their companies and get moving again.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was a difficult decision, and it came with significant risk.\xc2\xa0 But the President was not willing to walk away from those workers, and to allow the great American automobile industry disappear.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, that industry is coming back, creating jobs and moving cars off the line.\xc2\xa0 Last month the automotive industry added nearly -- rather 11,000 positions, bringing the total number of jobs added in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 36,000.\xc2\xa0 The industry added 100,000 jobs over the course of 2011.\xc2\xa0 In December, we saw auto sales climb for the seventh consecutive month, and the Big Three -- Ford, GM and Chrysler -- all saw sale increases for December and the year as a whole.\xc2\xa0 Since Chrysler and GM emerged from bankruptcy in June of 2009, the auto industry has added back more than 170,000 jobs -- the best period of job growth for that industry in more than a decade.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would also note that, as many of you know, that one of the positive signs we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of late, among other positive signs for the economy, is the growth in manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 And while the automotive industry makes up 5 percent of manufacturing in this country, it is responsible for 25 percent of that rebound in manufacturing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo another reminder of why it was so important to make the decision the President made to rescue the American automobile industry a few years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will go to The Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s surprise personnel announcement.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Daley had earlier indicated he would stay through January of next year, and he was supposed to build relations with Republicans, build relations with the business community.\xc2\xa0 What prompted his sudden decision to leave?\xc2\xa0 And did he get to accomplish that?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have the strong relations that maybe he intended to build as he came in?</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, Jim, I appreciate the question, and I think this is a case where it\xe2\x80\x99s important and accurate to take at face value what Bill said, Bill Daley said in his letter of resignation to the President, and what the President said yesterday in announcing this transition.</p>\n<p>\n\t2011 has been -- was an extraordinary year in a rather extraordinary three years of this President\xe2\x80\x99s first term.\xc2\xa0 Even before he had officially taken the job, the day after he was announced, if I recall correctly, he was here in the White House doing some paperwork associated with taking over as Chief of Staff when the news came that there had been a shooting in Tucson, Arizona.\xc2\xa0 He found himself in the Situation Room with the President as that terrible news unfolded.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd from that day on, Bill Daley proceeded to help the President navigate an extremely event-filled and difficult year for Washington and for the country -- a year that included the Arab Spring, events in Egypt and Libya and the rest of the Middle East; the tsunami and -- earthquake and tsunami in Japan; a near-government shutdown; a extraordinarily impressive and important mission to remove Osama bin Laden from the face of the Earth; the very tough negotiations with Congress over the debt ceiling increase and deficit reduction that resulted, despite not achieving the grand bargain that the President and Bill Daley sought so aggressively -- nevertheless, locked in $2.2 trillion in deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the fall, he helped oversee the President\xe2\x80\x99s American Jobs Act proposal, which, by the end of the year, resulted in several provisions passing, including, most importantly, the extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese jobs are difficult.\xc2\xa0 People talk about how a year in the White House, and the West Wing in particular, you can measure it in dog years.\xc2\xa0 This one was particularly jam-packed.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said in his announcement in the State Dining Room, but also to us in a staff meeting, in a senior staff meeting, he is extremely grateful for Bill\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and for his friendship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it mean about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s outreach to the business community, though, and to Republicans?\xc2\xa0 He seemed to be your best opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 What does it mean going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, going forward with Jack Lew at the helm, we have someone who for decades has had excellent relations with both Democrats and Republicans, is broadly respected throughout Washington for his service in the House of Representatives for the former -- for then Speaker of the House Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, for his service in the Clinton administration, as well as his service here at the State Department and as Director of OMB.\xc2\xa0 I think if you ask any member of Congress -- Republican or Democrat -- who has dealt with Jack Lew, they will testify to the fact that he is a total straight shooter and knows how to work with members on both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he also, to the point about business, has a lot of respect in the business community, so there is continuity in that respect.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and he has said, is absolutely committed to working with Congress this year to get more accomplished for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we remain optimistic that opportunities will present themselves to do just that.\xc2\xa0 There are ones that -- there are things that have to get done, like the extension of the payroll tax cut and extension of unemployment insurance for the full calendar year.\xc2\xa0 There are other things that really should get done if members of Congress are listening to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 Putting construction workers back to work rebuilding our infrastructure is a key component of the American Jobs Act that could really help our economy, help folks who are out of work now go back to work rebuilding our bridges and highways and schools and other things, and working on projects that help our economy grow well beyond the duration of the project they\xe2\x80\x99re working on.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Jack Lew will be intimately involved in that process.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- while it was, as the President said, a surprise that Bill decided that this was the right time for him to go back to Chicago, a town he loves dearly, as does the President -- if I could digress, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s another family like the Daleys more closely associated with a great American city, so the connection there is extremely strong.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while this was a surprise for the President, the fact is it is because he has somebody like Jack Lew who can step right in and fulfill the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s role that we will not miss a beat here in the West Wing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned continuity.\xc2\xa0 How quickly do you want to -- does the President want to get a new budget director?\xc2\xa0 And how do you get over a confirmation hump given the toxic environment with Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make on Jack\xe2\x80\x99s replacement at OMB.\xc2\xa0 He will be staying there to finish the 2013 budget.\xc2\xa0 In addition to Jack, there is a very talented team, senior team there at the OMB that will function as effectively as they have under his leadership after he\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xc2\xa0 And once the President makes a decision about leadership at OMB, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an announcement for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he want to have somebody in shortly after the month --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- before the payroll tax cut extension?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go any further than I have.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any announcement the President might make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around.\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There was a GAO report that came out the other day.\xc2\xa0 And one of the conclusions that it found was that in the press releases the Treasury has put out regarding the TARP, it tended to highlight areas --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Regarding to what, sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In regarding press releases put out by the Treasury regarding TARP --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 TARP, okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that they tended to highlight those areas where TARP was making a profit, if you will, bringing money into the government but not the areas where the TARP was losing money for the government.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the report, Mike.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very straightforward about how much TARP has cost, what the projected cost was versus what the actual cost has been and where money has been paid back.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true also of the automobile industry.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any discrepancies with regard to that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the report.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Jack Lew, does the President have a short list or is he -- do you have a time frame in which he will come up with a short list for a successor for Jack Lew?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements on that and no estimation of the length of the list for you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President consider a recess appointment, using a recess appointment in light of the likely Republican opposition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last -- the reports that the President plans to create a government task force to monitor China for trade and other business violations and that he plans to announce this around the time of the State of The Union address -- can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements today on any new administration task forces or efforts on that issue.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we will continue to work to take the steps necessary to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak about this repeatedly, and he did so on his trip to the Asia Pacific region not that long ago, where he made it clear that he will continue to stand up for American workers and businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, Secretary Geithner is in Beijing today, and that is part of our constant discussions with China as well as our friends and partners in the region about the importance of the Asia Pacific region and the importance of our economic relations with that region.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Iranians apparently have confirmed to the Swiss, who are our protecting power, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve sentenced the American captive to death.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration heard anything, have you responded and how, to the Iranians through the Swiss?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s new?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you in terms of communications through the Swiss from us.\xc2\xa0 But we -- our position is what it was yesterday, which is that the charges, the allegations against Mr. Hekmati are false.\xc2\xa0 This is not the first time, though we could only hope it would be the last, that the Iranians have falsely accused people of being spies.\xc2\xa0 We urge his immediate release, and are working towards that end and hope that it happens soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that you know he\xe2\x80\x99s been officially sentenced to death, what\xe2\x80\x99s the response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is the response.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely -- the allegations are false, the sentence is absurd and wrong, and we urge his release.</p>\n<p>\n\tKen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, next week King Abdullah comes to the White House, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be his first visit.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about the efforts to jumpstart the Middle East peace process, we presume.\xc2\xa0 Again, not the first time they\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that.\xc2\xa0 Will there be any new approaches this time?\xc2\xa0 What will they try this time that they\xe2\x80\x99ve not tried before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President has already thanked King Abdullah for hosting the resumption of talks.\xc2\xa0 They will obviously discuss that issue.\xc2\xa0 They will discuss the King\xe2\x80\x99s efforts at reform in Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And they will discuss the host of issues affecting the region.\xc2\xa0 So it won\xe2\x80\x99t be limited simply to the Middle East peace process, although that will certainly be part of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to report about our approach to that very difficult issue.\xc2\xa0 Our commitment to doing everything we can, working with our partners, to urge both sides to come together and negotiate a peace remains very strong.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with Jordan and other nations toward that end.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied with the King\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to working to try to get things solved in a more peaceful way in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know our position on Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with a variety of and a long list of nations, friends, partners and allies around the region and the globe to put pressure on the Syrians, to put pressure on President Assad, whose legitimacy has long since been lost because of the wretched violence he\xe2\x80\x99s perpetrated upon his own people, and our position on that certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Brianna, and then Christi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Democratic Senator Robert Menendez is blocking the President\xe2\x80\x99s nomination of Judith Shwartz to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and some suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s because her long-time partner is the head of that corruption unit that investigated him.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned there\xe2\x80\x99s any sort of revenge going on here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, Brianna, I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously want to see all of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees considered in a timely manner, and we would like this nominee also to be considered in a timely manner.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on this particular nomination or those stories.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange it\xe2\x80\x99s a Democrat that\xe2\x80\x99s getting in the way this time?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any particular comment on this.\xc2\xa0 Whatever obstacles are presented by members of the Senate to nominees, we are always disheartened by those.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward very qualified nominees, including the woman you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to right now, and they ought to be considered on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the Senator -- he said he has substantive concerns.\xc2\xa0 Has he voiced those to the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a lot of in-depth discussions about that here.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is planning to pay in Indian rupees under a new financial mechanism with Iran, and Pakistan is going ahead with building the Pakistan-Iran pipeline.\xc2\xa0 So is the White House worried about these leaks in enforcing the sanctions on Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are working with our partners and allies around the country to enforce the sanctions and to take a multilateral approach, an approach that we hope will maximize the impact of the sanctions without creating any unintended consequences, any negative impacts on the oil markets or on our allies.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged in that effort right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you say what Bill Daley\xe2\x80\x99s role with the campaign will be and when it will begin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific announcement on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that he will be -- I mean, I would expect the campaign would have that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will be very involved.\xc2\xa0 He was involved last time.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be a suitably high-profile role.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is very committed to this President and to his reelection, to the policies that the President has put into place last year with Bill\xe2\x80\x99s help and to ensuring that all the work that has been done to pull this country out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, to put it on a path towards growth and job creation and greater security for the middle class continues.\xc2\xa0 And I know that Bill will be very involved in the reelection campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he traveling with the President tomorrow to Chicago?\xc2\xa0 Do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure, although I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he were.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I wanted to ask on Jack Lew and Bill Daley, when Bill Daley was named a year ago, the President made a point of saying, as a business guy, as you were talking with Jim about, he had created jobs.\xc2\xa0 He was the CEO of several companies.\xc2\xa0 Why, then -- since you also told Jim that Jack Lew has good ties to the business community -- why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President mention yesterday Jack Lew\xe2\x80\x99s private sector experience being a hedge fund executive at Citigroup?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s an answer to why.\xc2\xa0 Jack\xe2\x80\x99s resume is quite long.\xc2\xa0 It is most notable for the fact that he was budget director twice and in his first stint is, as the President mentioned, the only budget director in history to oversee three years of surpluses, surpluses that were quickly squandered in the years that the next administration was in power, and that his tenure here both at the State Department and here in the White House as director of OMB for the second time has been stellar.\xc2\xa0 But it is also true that he has private sector experience as a manager at a private firm.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is part of a very broad resume.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he was a manager at that private firm, The Huffington Post, which is not usually very critical of the administration, said that he ran Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s alternative investments division, which made billions of dollars by \xe2\x80\x9cbetting that U.S. homeowners would not be able to make their mortgage payments.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How does that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jack was a management executive.\xc2\xa0 He was not an investment advisor at Citigroup.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was the chief operating officer, I believe, was the title of the alternative investment --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But again, he was not an investment advisor.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t make investment advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how does that, running a business like that or helping to run a business like that, how does that square with what the President has been talking about with Richard Cordray and the administration is going to be really tough on the big banks when the White House -- new White House Chief of Staff is somebody who used to be at one of those big banks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I would suggest to you that you\xe2\x80\x99re tilling very fallow ground here, but I appreciate the effort.\xc2\xa0 We believe very strongly in the fact that the American financial industry needs to be successful and robust.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of the American economy.\xc2\xa0 It also needs to follow the same rules as Wall Street -- I mean as Main Street.\xc2\xa0 Wall Street needs to go by the same rules as Main Street.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the President pushed so hard to pass and sign into law Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he pushed so hard, since you raised it, to get Richard Cordray nominated -- I mean to get Richard Cordray confirmed.\xc2\xa0 And when Senate Republicans despite his obvious qualifications refused to allow an up or down vote on Richard Cordray, the President felt he had no other alternative but to make a recess appointment -- one of the relatively few recess appointments he has made as President compared to his predecessors -- because this country needs, the middle class here in this country, folks who engage with non-bank financial institutions like payday lenders and non-bank mortgage brokers and things, they need somebody here in town watching out for them, looking out for their interests.\xc2\xa0 So the President is absolutely committed to the mission that CFPB has and to the mission that Richard Cordray specifically has.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 How will Jack Lew and Pete Rouse split up their duties?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we will wait until Jack takes over as Chief of Staff, which will not be before the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 He has some loose ends to tie up as OMB Director, and he will obviously make some decisions about how his office is structured going forward.\xc2\xa0 But Pete is an invaluable senior advisor to the President.\xc2\xa0 His role under Bill Daley was highly effective in terms of helping the operations of the West Wing run smoothly, and I am very confident that Pete will continue to be one of the most valuable players here in the West Wing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has -- and I know that the transition is still taking place -- but has it been determined who the point person for Congress will be at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, for what?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Congress.\xc2\xa0 Who will be the lead person?\xc2\xa0 Who will we see sort of leading when we revisit the payroll tax cut debate, for example?\xc2\xa0 Who will take the lead on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, we have a variety of folks who engage in that, but we do have -- our head of Legislative Affairs is Rob Nabors, who -- speaking of most valuable players -- might be my top vote getter.\xc2\xa0 So he will, as he has, take the lead in that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, Jack Lew as the Chief of Staff will obviously have a large role as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no question.\xc2\xa0 No question.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, in terms of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s legacy at OMB, is that he was intimately involved in that process last fall and in December to bringing that agreement finally to fruition with Congress that allowed for the extension of the payroll tax cut to make sure that 160 million Americans didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a tax hike as a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day present.\xc2\xa0 And he will be intimately involved in the effort to ensure that Congress does the right thing without drama and extends it for the full year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One political insider described the timing of this as switching places in a canoe in rough waters.\xc2\xa0 How does the administration see the timing of this, given that you are headed into a tough reelection year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would disagree with that description because of what I think I told Jim, which is that Bill\xe2\x80\x99s leadership has been exceptional through a very challenging year.\xc2\xa0 Jack has been there.\xc2\xa0 He has I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember been a participant in the 7:30 a.m. meeting, as you know, the meeting of the most senior staff in the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office every morning.\xc2\xa0 Jack has been there every morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe will, I think, as much as anyone possibly could, slide pretty effortlessly and seamlessly into that role.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s widely respected here inside the West Wing and the broader White House, just as he is up on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for those of you who know him, he is just about as decent and smart an individual as you will ever encounter here in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Cecilia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court today is hearing arguments on indecency in broadcasting.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this administration supports those stricter standards.\xc2\xa0 But would you at all agree with critics who say you can log onto the Internet at any time during the day, you can turn on cable television at any time and see and hear these images that are being questioned right now?\xc2\xa0 And in any way would you concede with these critics who say there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for the government to take stricter controls over broadcasting in this day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess that I have not looked into this issue, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to venture an opinion except to say that as a parent you always have to weigh concerns about exposing kids to things as a parent you\xe2\x80\x99d otherwise -- you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not have them exposed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take your question in terms of the broader issue because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I know you addressed this yesterday, the insourcing forum, but can you tell us more about I guess what the President wants to learn out of that?\xc2\xa0 Is this -- I know it seems like an idea session, but is he trying to come up with ways -- is this the groundwork for in the future possibly ideas to spur more insourcing or foreign --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 He wants to hear from the executives who will be part of this forum, participating in it, and who are examples of major American companies that have brought jobs back to the United States, why they did that, what were the incentives to doing that.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s very interested in ideas that go to just your question, which is what can we do to further develop this trend, which has American companies that are international and global companies, that do have factories and installations abroad and employ a lot of people abroad, what kind of incentives can be created to bring those jobs back to the United States that keep companies highly competitive, keep them making the best products in the world -- with American labor when that\xe2\x80\x99s possible and when that makes sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, absolutely, this will be a two-way session where ideas are exchanged, as well as the fact of insourcing and reinvesting in America is noted and celebrated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to bring or I guess announce any ideas related to that, or just kind of talk to them, talk to the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him make whatever announcements he might want to make tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I think it will be an important event, and it goes to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about and he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about for a long time now, which is that he is committed to doing whatever he can, working with the private sector, using his executive authority, working with Congress, to further grow the economy, to get the economy creating more jobs as we dig ourselves out of this terrible recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is an important aspect of this.\xc2\xa0 I noted at the top the decision he made about the automobile industry, to rescue it, and why that has paid dividends and why it was the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of decisions and levers that a President can pull -- decisions he can make and levers he can pull to help that cause.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to exercising all his options with regard to growing the economy and creating jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President recently went to CFPB and was a booster for the employees there.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s doing the same thing at EPA this afternoon, something similar, celebrating the employees there.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to continue to do that around the executive branch?\xc2\xa0 It seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of rediscovered that he has these career people who are keeping the government operating.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s keenly aware of the high level of -- the high quality of people working out in the agencies, doing exemplary work for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview or predict other visits he might make, but he is noting important work that people are doing.\xc2\xa0 And his visit today, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, is about that and -- EPA played an integral role in the automobile efficiency standards -\xe2\x80\x93 fuel efficiency standards that were announced by the President as he was surrounded by close to a dozen automobile executives, automobile company executives.\xc2\xa0 EPA was integral on that.\xc2\xa0 EPA was -- obviously played a lead role in the mercury standards that were released after more than a decade, maybe two decades of work on that.\xc2\xa0 Mercury, as you know, is a very dangerous neurotoxin and those standards are very important to the health and welfare of American children and American citizens across the country.\xc2\xa0 So he will thank them for their hard work and thank them for the work to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he at all -- just to follow up, is he at all concerned that some of his decisions seem to -- recently seem to have gone against EPA\xe2\x80\x99s direction?\xc2\xa0 And does he feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to maybe boost the morale about his support for their work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you were more on target in the first part of your question about taking note of the often unheralded work that really talented Americans do at some of these agencies and the work they do on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And then with regard to the EPA, which is often under siege but is responsible for ensuring that the air we breathe, that our children breathe when they run out on the soccer field is clean and that the water they drink is clean and not harmful, do really important work.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is an agency that was created under President Nixon -- people forget -- and has been responsible for ensuring the health and safety, in many cases, of millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll note that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger Runningen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Mr. Geithner being in China a few minutes ago.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is asking China to reduce imports of oil from Iran.\xc2\xa0 Are there some indications that China might do that?\xc2\xa0 Or what arguments is the administration making to convince them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to the answer I gave about sanctions on Iran generally and our efforts multilaterally to work with our friends and allies around the globe in that effort to ensure that they are implemented in a way that has maximum effect, maximum designed effect, and the fewest number of unintended consequences.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having that discussion with leaders of numerous countries, allies and partners around the world as regard that effort with Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any indications that they might proceed to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of either Secretary Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s conversations or other conversations we may or may not be having with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio in his dealings with China is certainly broader than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A real quick question.\xc2\xa0 The debt ceiling increase, does that need to go to the Hill this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific announcement for you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident it will be executed in a matter of days, not weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, did you have something?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Landler, did you have something?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 Speaking of Mr. Geithner, when the Treasury Secretary indicated to the President that he wanted to go home to New York, the President leaned on him exceptionally hard to stay on the job.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why that case is different than the case of the Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 I understand he asked him to sleep on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different order of pressure than he brought to bear on the Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Why is it easier to let this happen than it was to let that happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply address the Daley decision -- Daley without the \xe2\x80\x9cI.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, Bill, for those of you who know him, I think made up his mind, believed it was the right time.\xc2\xa0 And yes, the President did ask him to reconsider, to sleep on it, to think about it, and they would talk again the next day.\xc2\xa0 But Bill had made his decision, and the President respected that.\xc2\xa0 And he understood, in particular perhaps because of their shared love of Chicago and as their mutual hometown, and understanding Bill\xe2\x80\x99s connection to it, why he would want to return to Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s point out here that Bill will continue to be a very important part of the team in the broader effort here in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection and will be available to give advice to the President, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as the President noted, he will be calling Bill for advice going forward.\xc2\xa0 But I think that Bill was very clear about what his decision was.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would have been the President\xe2\x80\x99s clear preference for him to stay through this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve established that the President was surprised and -- but completely understood Bill\xe2\x80\x99s decision and was gratified by the fact that both he and Bill had the same thought, which is that Jack Lew would be an excellent successor to Bill as Chief of Staff, and gratified by the fact that Jack Lew was, if you will, standing by and ready to be able to take on those responsibilities and to do so seamlessly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question on this.\xc2\xa0 Did the President make sort of a persuasive, impassioned case to Mr. Daley?\xc2\xa0 This is why -- \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got so much left to do together, please think about staying on.\xc2\xa0 I know you may not love it, but\xe2\x80\x9d -- anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a further readout of that private conversation or conversations because there was -- there were more than -- there was more than one.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve unveiled the tick-tock with a fair amount of detail, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned that any other senior members of the administration might choose to leave during this year?\xc2\xa0 Has he done what some of his predecessors have done, asking senior staff, senior Cabinet-level people to stick with it for an election year to bring continuity to the -- keep continuity for the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is concerned about staff turnover.\xc2\xa0 He knows that everybody here is committed to this enterprise, to helping the American people -- helping him help the American people; helping him do what he can do as President to grow the economy and create jobs and keep Americans safe both here and abroad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTransitions are an inherent part of -- as you know, Ann, you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered several White Houses.\xc2\xa0 You know that transitions are a part of it.\xc2\xa0 These are demanding jobs.\xc2\xa0 I mean, think about what flows through the corridors and offices here.\xc2\xa0 Every -- decisions of enormous global impact are made every day, and the pressure is significant.\xc2\xa0 The privilege is profound.\xc2\xa0 But these are not jobs that people occupy for long periods of time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always been the case, and especially in this White House where the Chiefs of Staff in all cases have been and will be empowered and have significant portfolios and responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 These are tough jobs, and the President appreciates Bill\xe2\x80\x99s service just as he greatly appreciated Rahm Emanuel\xe2\x80\x99s service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly the point, that because of the sensitivity and the import of these jobs, if the top person in a presidential campaign leaves, it\xe2\x80\x99s interpreted as a problem with the campaign or a disruption?\xc2\xa0 Is that not applicable to the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is, Ann, because of the kind of team that this President has assembled that allows for this transition, which I accept is a big one -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the Chief of Staff -- but allows for it to be as smooth as it will be because of the exceptional qualifications and temperament that Jack Lew brings to this job.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think this will be exceptionally smooth and seamless.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s because of the way that Bill has effectively been Chief of Staff, and the way that the President has dictated to his senior staffers how they ought to conduct their business, and because of the kinds of men and women the President has surrounded himself with.</p>\n<p>\n\tI just ended a sentence with a preposition.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you if I could ask one two-part question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 NPR.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of vacancies, what can you tell us about the Domestic Policy Council?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell that the President has asked -- and she has accepted -- Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz to be the next White House Director of Domestic Policy.\xc2\xa0 Cecilia, as you know, has served as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, where she has overseen the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with state and local governments.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs IGA director, under Valerie Jarrett, Ms. Mu\xc3\xb1oz leads a partnership between federal, state, local and tribal governments that Governing Magazine described as \xe2\x80\x9cmore prominent and responsive than it ever was\xe2\x80\x9d -- citing praise from local and state elected officials from across the political spectrum.</p>\n<p>\n\tCecilia has enormous experience and brings a great deal of policy knowledge and intellect to this position, and the President is greatly appreciative of the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s willing to take on this important job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody else?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You again?\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three in one day.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this will help I guess outreach to the Hispanic community, considering her prior role?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Cecilia is the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And she has done great work at IGA.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s -- for those of you who know her and know how -- what an effective advocate she is for the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies and how knowledgeable she is about the whole set of domestic policy issues that any White House confronts and that this President has been dealing with for the past three years.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Hold on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I see.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to keep it clean, Lester, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to keep it clean?\xc2\xa0 Oh, my.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following the latest action by Iran, and now Syria\xe2\x80\x99s Assad saying -- coming out against I guess pressure against his regime -- has the White House has conversations with their allies about increasing the pressure that they\xe2\x80\x99re putting on the two governments, and maybe being --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, on Iran and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran and Syria both.\xc2\xa0 And maybe stepping it up and being a little more aggressive in the pressure that they\xe2\x80\x99re putting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the answer is absolutely we have been working quite aggressively with the international community, with our partners and allies around the world, to put pressure on Syria and put pressure -- and isolate Iran.\xc2\xa0 And in both cases -- and obviously with regards to Iran, this is an ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 We have effectively isolated Iran to a degree that has never before been the case.\xc2\xa0 And the impact of the sanctions and the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented is profound as every report out there has recognized.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with our allies to do that, to get Iran to behave, to live up to its international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in the case of Syria, to pressure President Assad to cease the violence against his own people, and to step aside so that the Syrian people can have the democratic transition that they demand and deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do these talks include military action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have said with regards broadly to these questions that the President, of course, takes no option off the table, but that we are focused in both cases on diplomatic, economic and other non-military actions that we can take to bring about the results that we and many, many countries around the world -- our international partners and allies -- are demanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My last question is, a lot of people in the region are wondering what more it can take from these regimes to do to I guess see a military or strong response from the U.S. and its allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- again, we take no option off the table.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- well, I would just say that.\xc2\xa0 We take no option off the table.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing at this point diplomatic, economic and other means to bring about the results that we and so many other nations are demanding with regards to Iranian and Syrian behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tSorry, behind Chris.\xc2\xa0 Tell me --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nadia, of course.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you confirm that President Saleh of Yemen is no longer requesting to come to the U.S., and when was the last time that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have an update on that.\xc2\xa0 Let me see.\xc2\xa0 As of -- let me just double-check and see if it\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on his application status for you.\xc2\xa0 To my understanding it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 But if it has, I can -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you please?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because there is news that he is going to Saudi Arabia now instead of coming to the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that.\xc2\xa0 But that -- what his decisions might be about where he might be going may not necessarily be related to his application status for a visa here.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one?\xc2\xa0 Just one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Rick Santorum said that he and the President have the same view on same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to candidates using his position on marriage equality to say that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Chris, you know very well what the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are on LGBT issues and civil rights, and the President is very proud of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s record on those issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the question.\xc2\xa0 The question is about marriage.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The question is -- but I have no updates for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 I think that you know and others here know and understand that his position broadly on LGBT issues is quite significantly different from that particular candidate\xe2\x80\x99s views.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Neal, last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have just two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First one, Mitt Romney told supporters at an event that he knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to worry about getting pink-slipped, and the comment is getting a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President had any reaction to that, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s ever had to worry about -- had that sort of anxiety himself?\xc2\xa0 Do you know of a time when that happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to his memoir.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him, and I have not discussed those remarks with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow on Chris\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, Sarah Palin tweeted out something similar, but the language that she used was very specific.\xc2\xa0 She said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe President position on the definition of marriage is the same as Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s, Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s and Romney\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.
