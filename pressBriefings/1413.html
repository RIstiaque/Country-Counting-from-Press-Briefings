BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Special guest, Karen Mills, administrator of the Small Business Administration.\xc2\xa0 All right, so, just for starters, when we -- is everybody ready to go?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So, New Hampshire -- well, first of all, aboard Air Force One, we have, of course, Administrator Mills here, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen is on board.\xc2\xa0 When we hit the ground, Governor John Lynch and Mayor Theodore Gatsas of Manchester will greet us.\xc2\xa0 Then we\'ll go on to a tour of ARC Energy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ARC?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 ARC.\xc2\xa0 What they do there is they\'re pioneering a new manufacturing process for ultra-efficient LED lights at affordable prices.\xc2\xa0 Then on to the town hall at Nashua High School North.\xc2\xa0 There\'s about 1,600 folks who will be in the audience.\xc2\xa0 Six hundred tickets were given to the school and local officials to hand out; 1,000 tickets were made available online, first come, first serve.\xc2\xa0 Representatives Hodes and Shea-Porter will be there, along with Mayor Donnalee Lozeau of Nashau; the State Treasurer Catherine Provencher will be there; State Attorney General Michael Delaney.\xc2\xa0 The President will be introduced by Tim Dining, the President and CEO of Greenerd Press and Manufacturing, which is a small business that designs and builds hydraulic presses.</p>\n<p>The President will talk a little bit about what he\'s doing to take on the urgent economic and jobs crisis that we\'re in.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll, of course, talk a little bit about the small business proposal.\xc2\xa0 And on bipartisanship, citing the retreat last week, the President will point out that there are plenty of places where the two parties agree, and a little bit about the responsibility of both parties to work together to solve some of the urgent problems that we\'ve got facing us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s taking Q and A?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He sure is.\xc2\xa0 He sure is.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I just want to hand it over to Karen Mills here, who is going to talk a little bit about the proposal.\xc2\xa0 Step right up here.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR MILLS:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you guys.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to see you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\'s it going to take for some of this money to actually get into people\'s hands?\xc2\xa0 It\'s a proposal now -- a while, I assume.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR MILLS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 As you know, small businesses are really the focus that we\'re taking in terms of job growth.\xc2\xa0 And one of the issues is how we get more capital, more lending, into the hands of small business.\xc2\xa0 We know there\'s a small business lending gap.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made a lot of strides at the SBA.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got $19 billion out with the Recovery Act, and the question is how to close the rest of the gap.</p>\n<p>Today you\'re going to hear about one of the major pieces of that plan.\xc2\xa0 When you look at what\'s causing the problem, the problem is that small community banks might lack capital.\xc2\xa0 And how are we going to get them to get more money out to small businesses?\xc2\xa0 Well, this $30 billion, which will be in a separate lending facility, will be available to small banks to increase their amount of capital.\xc2\xa0 When you put in $30 billion of capital you usually get out more than a multiplier of that in loans.</p>\n<p>So some banks don\'t have enough capital, and the small business will come up to them and say, you know, "I\'m a good business, you\'ve always lent to me, I need a loan."\xc2\xa0 And they\'ll say, "Can\'t do it right now."\xc2\xa0 So this will enable banks to have the capital to make those loans.</p>\n<p>Other banks say, "I have capital, I just don\'t want to take the risk," and that\'s where the 90 percent guarantee and the continued Recovery Act programs at the SBA come in.\xc2\xa0 We have been able to say to banks, "You\'ve got a good customer here.\xc2\xa0 We will help you with this guarantee with higher loan limits, the $5 million loan limits, so that you can then reach out and close that part of the gap."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\'s a two-part strategy, hand in glove.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be restrictions that come with the $30 billion to the banks?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR MILLS:\xc2\xa0 In this proposal we have recognized that small banks are not interested in borrowing from TARP.\xc2\xa0 They are uncomfortable with the TARP stigmas or the TARP restrictions, and we have proposed here to Congress that we create a separate lending facility that is not affiliated with TARP and does not carry any of those issues that have prevented small banks from making -- taking that availability and lending it out.\xc2\xa0 We got to get them capitalized so that they can get the businesses the capital they need.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the process?\xc2\xa0 Is this a separate bill?\xc2\xa0 Is it ready to go?\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to people on the Hill about this?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR MILLS:\xc2\xa0 There is a lot of interest on the Hill in solving this problem, and quite a deep understanding that part of the problem is lack of availability to community banks.\xc2\xa0 People view community banks as integral to this.\xc2\xa0 You know, there\'s about 8,000 banks out there, and most of them are those banks on Main Street that have the connections to the small business.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a lot of support for helping community banks, and a lot of understanding that capital is part of the issue.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks a lot, Karen.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else for Karen before she --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR MILLS:\xc2\xa0 Good, thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, China had some tough warnings about the President possibly meeting with the Dalai Lama.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to meet?\xc2\xa0 Is there a time, date set for that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President told China leaders -- China\'s leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the Dalai Lama, and he intends to do so.\xc2\xa0 The Dalai Lama is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader, and the President will meet with him in that capacity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To be clear, the U.S. considers Tibet to be a part of China.\xc2\xa0 We have human rights concerns about the treatment of Tibetans.\xc2\xa0 We urge the government of China to protect the unique cultural and religious traditions of Tibet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President has expressed, we expect that our relationship with China is mature enough where we can work on issues of mutual concern, such as climate, the global economy, and nonproliferation, and discuss frankly and candidly those issues where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to building a positive, comprehensive, and cooperative relationship with China.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A date?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll announce a date as it comes closer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for dropping by.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you so much for your time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 NGA meeting -- what\'s the President\'s goals in speaking to the governors later this week, maybe tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President will talk about the economy and energy issues and we\'ll have more for you on that later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, any response to -- Politico has a story out about the CIA moonlighting for corporations.\xc2\xa0 Any response from the President on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, with the salary freeze that the President put in place, I\'ve actually been moonlighting as a bartender at Cap Lounge.\xc2\xa0 No, I -- this is something that the CIA is very particular about and I would refer specific questions to them.\xc2\xa0 But, no, it\'s not something that the President is concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The thousand tickets that were available online, how were those distributed?\xc2\xa0 Is it first come, first serve?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys -- I mean, everyone was interested in the GOP town hall and that exchange and the parry with the President.\xc2\xa0 Any sense that we\'re going to see that today, or any hopes that we\'d kind of see that engagement today with the audience?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- for folks who have seen the President at town halls and in all the sort of public venues where he\'s taking questions, he works hard to be as candid as possible about the urgent challenges that we face and about what he\'s doing to take them on.\xc2\xa0 He\'s very transparent about his decision-making process, why he chooses one thing and why he doesn\'t choose another.\xc2\xa0 And this is an opportunity to talk directly with folks in New Hampshire and all over the country about some of these key issues.</p>\n<p>So I can\'t promise that people will be as engaged in this around the country as they were in the GOP caucus meeting last Friday, but I -- there\'s always a lot of chance when you\'re in a town hall with 1,600 people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any update on when he\'s going to create the deficit reduction commission, the executive order, issue the executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\'re of course working with members of the House and Senate of both parties on Capitol Hill on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on the timeline for you, but this is something that people of both parties support and something that we hope to make some progress on very soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:31 P.M.
