Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0A full house today. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0I assume it\'s only because you all missed me. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I assume. \xc2\xa0All right, I do not have anything at the top, Julie, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. Welcome back.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President, on his swing through Asia, was quite critical of his political opponents in terms of their criticism of his handling of the campaign against the Islamic State. \xc2\xa0Over the weekend, Leon Panetta, who obviously worked for the President, said that the resources being applied to the Islamic State mission have not been sufficient. \xc2\xa0Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, who\xe2\x80\x99s been quite supportive of the President, said something similar. \xc2\xa0What does the President make of the criticism coming from people who have either worked for him or been partners of him in Washington?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Julie, I haven\'t spoken to him about those specific comments that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just cited. \xc2\xa0I think the one thing that -- I think there are two things, actually, that at least those two individuals are keenly aware of. \xc2\xa0The first is that both of them are aware of how challenging this particular problem is. \xc2\xa0When it comes to a situation in Syria, for years this has been a difficult problem to work through and there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying how significant that challenge has been, as the United States and our coalition partners have worked through it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing -- and in some ways, this is more important -- each of them, to a person, is keenly aware of the priority that the President has placed on working through this problem in a way that advances our national security interests. \xc2\xa0Both of them have been involved in extended conversations with the President about the policy options that were available. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly has valued the advice that they have given over the years, and certainly if they have additional ideas or suggestions we\'re willing to take their call. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is, taking a look at all of the resources that has gone into this is to understand that there is a comprehensive strategy that is being implemented by the United States and the 64 other members of our coalition. \xc2\xa0And I think that is a testament to the priority that the President places on this issue. \xc2\xa0It\'s also a testament to the American leadership that\'s at work here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does the President think that the resources he\xe2\x80\x99s devoted to this mission are sufficient?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President certainly believes that there is more that our coalition partners can do to contribute to this effort and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not coalition partners, the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again -- it sounds like you may have looked at their comments more closely than I did, but based on the way that you presented them in your first question, the question is are enough resources being dedicated to the mission. The success of this mission is dependent on 65 nations coming together, recognizing the common interests that they have here and dedicating significant resources. \xc2\xa0And we have seen stepped-up contributions even over the course of the last week from members of that coalition and we certainly welcome those stepped-up contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But are you saying that the U.S. resources are sufficient and it\'s additional resources needed from coalition partners that\xe2\x80\x99s the issue here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, our point is that we certainly have been engaged in conversations, and the President was as he was traveling around the world over the last week -- having conversations with leaders like President Erdogan; he met with our European leaders, our European allies in Turkey as well -- and those conversations centered on what those members of our coalition can do to contribute more resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tI certainly wouldn\'t rule out that there might be additional resources that are contributed by the United States. \xc2\xa0But when you consider the range of elements to our strategy, it\'s clear that the United States is making significant contributions and -- whether that\'s the United States being the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the significant problem of Syrian refugees, or when you consider the significant investment of our military resources to apply pressure to ISIL leadership and to support fighting forces on the ground as they regain territory from ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to ask about the situation in Brussels. \xc2\xa0What does the President make of the steps that officials there have taken to essentially put the city on lockdown for several days as they look for suspects in the Paris attacks? \xc2\xa0Does he believe that that is the right approach?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'re certainly not going to be in a situation where we\'re Monday-morning-quarterbacking the efforts that are underway in Brussels -- or anywhere, frankly -- to ensure the safety of the citizens of that European city. \xc2\xa0Obviously the United States is committed to sharing information and assisting with that investigation as it is ongoing. \xc2\xa0But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have we been sharing information with the authorities in Belgium?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0The United States has longstanding information-sharing agreements with countries in Europe. \xc2\xa0This is actually an area where we do believe that there is more that our European partners can do in terms of improving the quality and quantity of information that they share with one another, but also improving the amount of information and the way that information is shared with the United States. \xc2\xa0But that is certainly something that we are committed to, and we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to helping our allies in Europe deal with this rather urgent threat.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0While the President was away, a number of Republicans applauded what they said was a delay of the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to close Guantanamo, meaning the plan that he would be presenting to Congress. \xc2\xa0Does the White House view this as a delay? \xc2\xa0And is there any rethinking of plans to transfer Guantanamo prisoners to the United States in light of the refugee crisis? \xc2\xa0That somehow -- sorry, not another refugee crisis -- the rhetoric around Syrian refugees. \xc2\xa0Is there any kind of a rethink of perhaps this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best time to also be bringing Guantanamo Bay prisoners into the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think this actually is a situation where this is not the best time for the United States continuing to operate a prison facility that we know is a powerful recruiting tool that is used by extremists around the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President did talk about this in the news conference that he did a couple of days ago. \xc2\xa0We know that ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s chief messaging goal is to portray themselves as the true inheritors or the true defenders of Islam and to make aggressively the case that the Western world is at war with Islam. \xc2\xa0Of course, those two narratives are false. \xc2\xa0But doing something like continuing to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay only serves to advance the narrative that ISIL is seeking to write, and now is actually a good time for the United States to take the long, overdue step of finally closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve our national security interests. \xc2\xa0If anything, it undermines them. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not an efficient or effective use of taxpayer dollars when you consider the alternatives that are available, which is to transfer to other countries those individuals that can be safely transferred, and to otherwise dispense with those who can be prosecuted, put them through our criminal justice system, and to safely detain those individuals who cannot be transferred. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that we can\xe2\x80\x99t make progress in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when should we expect to see that plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of the timing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sometime soon? \xc2\xa0I mean, you used to say soon. \xc2\xa0Is it still?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s still generally the timeframe, but at some point, that probably becomes inoperative. \xc2\xa0But the commitment that does remain operative is that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we do and intend to present to Congress, and when we do, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make public for all of you to consider as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And I also wanted to get your reaction to drug company Pfizer\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that they plan to buy Ireland-based Allergan, which would be the largest tax-inversion deal. \xc2\xa0Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the U.S. should block that deal. \xc2\xa0Is there anything the U.S. government could do to block that transaction? \xc2\xa0I know that the President has said that he does not favor tax-inversion deals, but is the White House looking at anything it might do in this case?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Julia, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific comments on any specific, private financial transaction, including the one that you just cited. \xc2\xa0There are a couple things, though, that I do think bear mentioning. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is, just last week, the Secretary of the Treasury announced a handful of administrative steps that the Treasury Department was taking to try to reduce the incentive and lower the benefit for those countries that are seeking to engage in a corporate inversion. \xc2\xa0And the second is to remind you of the President\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding concern and outright criticism of companies that pursue this strategy that essentially allows them to renounce their citizenship while continuing to benefit from all that America has to offer. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd whether that is the extraordinarily talented workforce that\xe2\x80\x99s in this country, or the education system we have in place to ensure that there is a good pipeline of workers that companies can benefit from, obviously the United States has large customer markets and infrastructure in place that companies benefit from. And the President has said it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair for companies to essentially renounce their citizenship, seek to -- at least on paper -- locate themselves somewhere else just so they can pay a lower tax rate. \xc2\xa0That certainly is not the kind of benefit that\xe2\x80\x99s available to middle-class families. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s worse is that there are Republicans in Congress that continue to protect the ability of corporations to engage in these kinds of actions. \xc2\xa0And I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what you get when you have companies that essentially have bought and paid for members of Congress. \xc2\xa0It may serve the corporate bottom line of some of these companies, but it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t advance the -- it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strengthen the economy of the United States, and it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enhance the prospects of middle-class families in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I can follow on Pfizer a little bit. \xc2\xa0This would be the largest inversion deal in history. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this is fresh off the moves that the Treasury Department made last week but presumably would be unaffected by them, why are those moves effective in any way if the largest drug company in the U.S. can go ahead and do the largest pharmaceutical deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, for the details around the Treasury announcement, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them and they may be able to explain to you how or whether their announcement would apply to this specific transaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Treasury Department for more than a year has been announcing a series of administrative actions to, like I said, reduce the benefit associated with companies executing an inversion. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the pace of those inversion announcements slow as a result of the -- or at least since that Treasury announcement was first made. \xc2\xa0Now, I guess whether those two things are connected I guess is something that you\xe2\x80\x99d have to dig into, but the pace of these kinds of announcements has slowed since the Treasury Department did begin carrying out these administrative actions to limit the benefit associated with companies doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that all along we have acknowledged that the Treasury Department is rather limited in what they can do administratively and that what is required is congressional action. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget has consistently laid out a specific proposal for closing this loophole that only benefits corporations and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t benefit middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And we continue to believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that Congress should act on. \xc2\xa0I think just about every Democrat agrees with the President that this should be a priority. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans who are blocking any legislative action because they\xe2\x80\x99re more interested -- it appears, as least -- in supporting wealthy corporate interests and not middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Pfizer says the deal would be good for America because it leads to more investment in medical research and keeps 40,000 people invested in the U.S. \xc2\xa0Do you guys agree with that characterization?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on the specific results of a -- or the specific consequences of one private financial transaction. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the sort of anti-trust implications or even what the effect would be on drug prices? \xc2\xa0I know that\xe2\x80\x99s been something that you guys have talked about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I assume that\xe2\x80\x99s something that would be subject to a Department of Justice review, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of how that process is carried out or whether or not even the Department of Justice has publicly said that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to take a look at it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0And then one last one on something Secretary Kerry said last week. \xc2\xa0It was about funding for the contribution to the global climate fund. \xc2\xa0He said that the President -- he was kind of trying to bolster support, reassure allies, and said all of the -- on the appropriations process -- that the President is prepared to veto the budget because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t included in it. \xc2\xa0And you can usually find some money, so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, to put a finer point on that, are you guys going to veto any budget appropriations that\xe2\x80\x99s been floated would slash funding for the State Department that they\xe2\x80\x99ve use to make that payment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a veto threat to issue from here today on this particular issue. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this is a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s included in our budget proposal. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to continue to make the case to Congress that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s worth funding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was Secretary Kerry kind of off the reservation there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s indicating that this is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President has communicated to other world leaders directly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll communicate directly to leaders in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnita.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting this morning -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming it\xe2\x80\x99s over -- with the ambassadors of the countries that are working to fight the Islamic State. \xc2\xa0Can you just sort of tell us about that meeting, and then the purpose? \xc2\xa0And then I had sort of a follow-up on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a detailed readout since the meeting has concluded, but I can tell you the purpose of the meeting. \xc2\xa0There were 59 of the 65 countries who are part of our coalition represented at the meeting. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re represented by their -- represent their ambassadors to the United States. \xc2\xa0And the conversation focused on how countries who are part of our coalition can ramp up their contributions to our efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s true is that the progress that has been made thus far has been a result of the significant contributions that members of our coalition have made. \xc2\xa0Let me just go through a few of them that the President cited in his news conference.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are nearly two dozen nations who have made a military contribution to our counter-ISIL campaign. \xc2\xa0There are 15 different nations that have deployed personnel in support of training local forces on the ground in Iraq and Syrian forces in other countries. \xc2\xa0There are 25 nations who are part of the effort that\xe2\x80\x99s being coordinated by Germany and the UAE to stabilize areas that have been liberated from ISIL. \xc2\xa0There is an effort underway to train Iraqi police forces that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the Italians. \xc2\xa0And there are 34 different nations around the world that have taken steps to arrest individuals seeking to travel to Iraq and in Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tCountering the flow of foreign fighters has been a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s for more than a year. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall the President convened a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly meeting more than a year ago to talk about how to shut down the flow of foreign fighters and to coordinate the international effort to do so. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 34 nations respond to that call.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s been an international effort to crack down on ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing efforts. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an international effort that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the Saudis. \xc2\xa0We certainly appreciate their contribution to that effort. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve also talked about how important it is to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s messaging online and to make sure that we are mobilizing resources and voices inside the Muslim community to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s narrative. \xc2\xa0And there is a communications center that was opened in the UAE to lead this effort, but we would anticipate that there will be additional centers that will be open around the world, including in Malaysia, where the President just was.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll note is that we should not overlook the significant humanitarian effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway to try to meet the basic needs of those millions of Iraqis and Syrians who are fleeing violence in their home countries. \xc2\xa0And the international effort to try to meet their basic needs is important and is dependent on international coordination and dependent on the leadership of the United States, because the United States has actually made the largest contribution to that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to be clear -- your words at the beginning were, \xe2\x80\x9cramp up.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So the United States is trying to convince some of the countries, all of the countries, to ramp up their activities?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do is to lay out for you how critically important the contributions that countries of this coalition have been. \xc2\xa0And we believe that there is more that can be done if countries are willing to contribute additional resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then just to follow, do you find, as Russia is sort of looking to form their own coalition, perhaps peeling off members of this coalition -- the U.S.-led coalition -- do you think that the U.S.-led coalition is eroding in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s zero evidence of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And your thoughts on what Russia is doing, in terms of trying to form their own coalition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think the President has been pretty blunt about what Russia is doing. \xc2\xa0Right now, what Russia is doing is they are undermining our effort to reach a political settlement, and they are doing that because they are concerned primarily with propping up the failed regime of Bashar al-Assad. And those efforts only undermine our ability to engage the moderate Syrian opposition in a discussion about the long-overdue political transition that even Russia acknowledges is needed and long overdue inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have also said -- and the President said this on a number of occasions, as well -- if Russia is prepared to change their strategy and prepared to focus their efforts on ISIL, and to work with the international community to do that, then we would welcome them as members of our coalition. \xc2\xa0And certainly their efforts and the resources that they can bring to bear would be important. \xc2\xa0But thus far, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been unable to do that. \xc2\xa0They focused on another goal, and it is not one that has allowed them to build a coalition on nearly the scale of what the United States has built.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President had an opportunity to discuss this issue directly with President Putin while we were in Turkey last week, and I know this is a conversation that Secretary Kerry has had with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, on a number of occasions. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that conversation, particularly now that, tragically, Russia understands the stakes for going after ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve said today and what the President said in his news conference about the support of the coalition, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s obvious reluctance to commit any U.S. -- further U.S. grounds troops, what in the world can come of a meeting between him and President Hollande? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the deliverable, other than expressions of solidarity and support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the meeting, but I also wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t downplay the significance of additional expressions of solidarity and support. \xc2\xa0This is a time when the French people are grieving. \xc2\xa0And knowing that they can count on the most powerful country in the world to have their back as they determine what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to strengthen homeland security in their own country but also to take the fight to ISIL I think that will be a source of significant comfort to the French people.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen the French, just in the last week, announce their willingness to ramp up their contributions. \xc2\xa0And we did see French military pilots carry out an additional round or two of airstrikes over Syria. \xc2\xa0And we certainly welcome that contribution.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty for the two leaders to talk about. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from them directly after they have their meeting and you can get a better sense of what they discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about everybody else ramping up their contributions. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the U.S. further ramping up its contributions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Bill, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been leading this coalition. So we formed the coalition, we continue to lead it. \xc2\xa0And I think whether you look at the humanitarian assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided or the contribution that the United States has made to the ongoing military campaign, our contribution has been significant. \xc2\xa0And the United States obviously has unique capabilities that we can bring to bear, and we have used them.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me give you one example. \xc2\xa0I just mentioned the French airstrikes that were carried out over Syria last week and that represented an escalation of their efforts. \xc2\xa0The airstrikes that they carried out were based on targets that were identified by the United States, based on intelligence that had been conducted by the United States. \xc2\xa0They were supported by mid-air refueling that was conducted by the United States. \xc2\xa0And they were backed by contingency operations -- search and rescue capabilities, for example -- to ensure that if something went wrong with those flights, that those pilots could be rescued. \xc2\xa0Those search and rescue capabilities were provided by the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that is an indication that the United States is certainly pulling more than our own weight when it comes to the contribution behind this coalition. \xc2\xa0But, look, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re glad to do. \xc2\xa0That is in line with the long tradition of American leadership. \xc2\xa0It certainly is a tradition that this President believes in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All that still leaves open the question of what, if anything, can come of this meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk to the two leaders tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tJames.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thank you. \xc2\xa0First, just to follow up on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, appeared on \xe2\x80\x9cYour World with Neil Cavuto\xe2\x80\x9d on November 16, and said -- and I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe President of the United States and other world leaders need to recognize that this is not a time to just kind of sit down and hope that somehow this enemy will go away.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s other Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, appear on \xe2\x80\x9cYour World with Neil Cavuto\xe2\x80\x9d four days later, on November 20, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have all along underestimated ISIS, both in terms of how tough it will be to root them out in Syria and Iraq, but also their ability to extend beyond that area to Europe and potentially also to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And then we also have the comments from Dianne Feinstein on \xe2\x80\x9cFace the Nation\xe2\x80\x9d yesterday: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the approach is sufficient to the job. This has gone on too long now, and it has not gotten better -- it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten worse.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tDo you acknowledge that the criticism of the President about underestimating ISIS, about prosecuting the effort with insufficient vigor are coming from people who are not conservatives, Republicans, presidential candidates or predictable opponents of the President -- these are coming from the people who worked with him -- do you acknowledge that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think Mr. Gates would probably describe himself as a conservative Republican, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was including the President when he was describing the \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d in the group of people who underestimated ISIL. \xc2\xa0I think the coalition mission that I described in terms of the contributions that we\'re getting from 65 other nations to apply significant pressure to ISIL, to carry out more than \xc2\xa08,000 airstrikes against them in Iraq and Syria, to apply pressure to their leadership, including taking out a range of ISIL leaders, our efforts to constrict their financing, the wide-ranging, integrated effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL I think is a testament to how seriously the President takes this challenge.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve defended the effort. \xc2\xa0I just want to be clear that you understand that the criticism of this effort is extending beyond the usual precincts, correct? \xc2\xa0To include people who have worked for this President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0To include people in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to their opinion. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think that either of those individuals would deny the seriousness with which the President has taken this issue or the complexity of arriving at a solution that is consistent with our national security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, President Obama said -- and I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cdestroying ISIL is not only a realistic goal, we\'re going to get it done.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Am I safe in inferring that in telling us \xe2\x80\x9cwe\'re going to get it done,\xe2\x80\x9d the President was not abandoning his past practice wherein he has always told us that this is going to be an effort that extends beyond his term? \xc2\xa0He isn\'t saying when he tells us \xe2\x80\x9cwe\'re going to get it done\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get it done? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He was the President expressing his resolute confidence that the United States and our 65 coalition partners will succeed in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But not before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, the President was clear that the length of time that this is likely to take will require a substantial commitment, both on the part of the United States but also on the part of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the United States\xe2\x80\x99 participation in the military piece of this, our operational tempo, increased in any discernable way since Paris?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the Department of Defense can give you sort of the latest accounting of the military operations that have been conducted in Iraq and Syria over the last week or so. \xc2\xa0I would expect that, for the reasons that I described to Bill, the stepped-up contributions of some of our partners in terms of the strikes that they have taken probably has required the United States to expend some additional effort to support their strikes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two more. \xc2\xa0The President also said in Kuala Lumpur about the intelligence he has received on ISIS -- which, as we all know, is now under investigation by the Pentagon IG -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s not as if I have been receiving wonderfully rosy, glowing portraits of what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in Iraq and Syria over the last year and a half. \xc2\xa0It feels to me like, at my level at least, we\'ve had a pretty clear-eyed, sober assessment of where we\'ve made real progress and where we have not.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Now, I\'ve asked you in this briefing previously if the President has confidence in the intelligence product he\xe2\x80\x99s received on ISIS over the last year and a half. \xc2\xa0Would I be wrong to construe those remarks from Kuala Lumpur as the President expressing confidence in the intelligence product that he\xe2\x80\x99s received over the last year and a half?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, James, what the President was trying to say -- and I want to be careful here because I don\'t want to get ahead of an ongoing Inspector General investigation -- I think what the President was trying to convey is that the intelligence reports that he\xe2\x80\x99s received about ISIL and the impact that they have had on Syria and Iraq, in particular, have been troubling. \xc2\xa0And that is part of what has prompted the kind of aggressive and sustained commitment to degrading and ultimately destroying that organization that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen put forward by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is entirely separate from the question that is currently being investigated by the inspector general. \xc2\xa0But what the President has long said and what he said again in that news conference is that he has made quite clear to military leaders and to intelligence officials that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for the best, most accurate assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening that he can possibly get because that\'s only going to improve his ability to make decisions about policy to address the situation on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as clear as people can be about what\xe2\x80\x99s exactly happening, that\'s what the President wants. \xc2\xa0And even if that means delivering some bad news, or even if that means providing some evidence to indicate that previous elements of our strategy didn\xe2\x80\x99t work as well as we had hoped, the President would rather get that information and make changes to the strategy where necessary than not. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President tells us that he feels as though he has been receiving clear-eyed intelligence. \xc2\xa0The Pentagon probe is aimed at determining whether, in fact, he was or not. \xc2\xa0Should his statement be weighed by the investigators, and in fact, would the President be willing to cooperate personally with this investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously the President believes in the value and importance of conducting independent investigations like this. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not aware that the Inspector General has sought any sort of presidential cooperation -- because I think, frankly, the investigation that they\xe2\x80\x99re conducting doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to the President\xe2\x80\x99s level. \xc2\xa0What they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to take a look the -- at least based on published reports, they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to take a look at what information -- how information worked its way through the bureaucracy at the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0They don\'t seem to be, at least at this point, based on public reports, concerned about anything beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve been very generous. \xc2\xa0When the President tells us in response to just about any question about the progress of the anti-ISIS effort that his strategy is making some progress amidst setbacks and that we\'ve always said this is going to take time, and if we get that answer on September 10, 2014, a day after he launched the effort, and if we\'re getting that same answer in Kuala Lumpur and in Antalya, Turkey, and so forth -- if we\'re going to get the same answer no matter if we\'re on the second day of the campaign or the 366th day of the campaign, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that in effect remove the President from accountability to the American people for how this operation is actually going?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I think the President is taking this action because he believes strongly that the national security of the United States and the American people is top priority as the Commander-in-Chief. \xc2\xa0And that\'s precisely why this operation has -- why this strategy has been implemented and why that it\'s in a way that it\'s been carried out. \xc2\xa0The focus has been on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL, and we would do that be applying significant military pressure to prevent them from establishing a safe haven inside of Syria and Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have taken ISIL leaders off the battlefield. \xc2\xa0We have regained territory inside of Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0We have succeeded in shutting off some parts of their financing efforts. \xc2\xa0So we have made important progress. \xc2\xa0Just in the last couple of weeks, I saw that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Special Presidential Envoy to the counter-ISIL effort, Brett McGurk, noted that just in the last couple of weeks, more than a thousand square kilometers in territory has been regained by fighters on the ground from ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0That\'s an indication of some of the progress that\'s being made.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President, as you pointed out, from the beginning has acknowledged that we\'ll enjoy some periods of success and some periods of progress, and that\'s part of any sort of ongoing military operation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that\'s what we\'ll continue to hear from him for the next year until he leaves office, correct? \xc2\xa0Progress, setbacks, it\'s going to take time -- right, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\'re going to hear?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hear from the President is a clear-eyed assessment of his view of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When did the President first learn that intelligence analysts down at CENTCOM were charging -- their intelligence reports were being whitewashed to make the situation look better than it really is in Iraq? \xc2\xa0When did he first learn about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, I first learned about it when these individuals -- when it became public that these individuals had raised their concerns with the Inspector General. \xc2\xa0And in some ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the process is supposed to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And how concerned is he? \xc2\xa0Because I imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to make decisions about military strategy when you can\xe2\x80\x99t trust the intelligence you\xe2\x80\x99re getting. \xc2\xa0How concerned is he about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President certainly is interested in the independent investigation running its course. \xc2\xa0But I think the President does -- I mean, as the President said yesterday, the President does have a lot of confidence in the individuals who are responsible for presenting intelligence information to him, primarily because he\xe2\x80\x99s given them very specific instruction about his desire to get the best possible sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening on the ground even if it means coming to the President with some bad news.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President also acknowledged that there\xe2\x80\x99s this area where people might have, based on the facts that are on the ground, reached differing conclusions based on their own analysis of the situation. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate. \xc2\xa0We want people with different points of view to be considering the facts in presenting their analysis to the President. \xc2\xa0And there is a mechanism for ensuring that differing views are incorporated into the intelligence material that\xe2\x80\x99s presented to the President. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly encourages those differing points of view from being represented in the materials that he\xe2\x80\x99s presented.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has he noticed a more realistic or pessimistic assessment coming from the CIA and other intelligence agencies than what he\xe2\x80\x99s seen come up through the military?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It would be hard for me to offer that assessment to you, Jon, just based on -- the amount of intelligence that I see is much less than the amount of intelligence the President sees, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to answer that question. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that anybody has expressed a tangible change in the intelligence that\xe2\x80\x99s being presented to the President of the United States that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the kinds of changes that we\xe2\x80\x99re actually seeing on the ground. \xc2\xa0I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s hard about this, is it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sort of control.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would he say that there has been, to a degree, an intelligence failure with the rise of ISIS? \xc2\xa0I mean, it caught so many people by surprise. \xc2\xa0It seems to have clearly caught the President by surprise that -- the rapidity with which ISIS swept into Iraq and took over this large area.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, Jon, I think the one area where there has been some surprise expressed was in, frankly, the weakness of the Iraqi security forces who were responsible for protecting the nation of Iraq from the ISIL advance. \xc2\xa0And I think there was surprise expressed that those forces retreated so rapidly in the face of ISIL fighters, in the face of that ISIL challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for a more detailed assessment of what the intelligence looked like prior to ISIL making those significant advances, you\xe2\x80\x99d probably have to ask somebody in the IC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about something else John Kerry said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He was commenting on the attacks in Paris and comparing them with the Charlie Hebdo attack, saying that there was a sort of particularized focus of perhaps even legitimacy in terms of -- well, not legitimacy, but a rationale you could attach yourself to somehow and say, okay, they\xe2\x80\x99re angry because of this and that. What do you make of the Secretary of State suggesting, first, that there could have been legitimacy to the attack on Charlie Hebdo, or at the very least a rationale to those attacks, and saying that somehow those were more understandable than what happened in this latest Paris attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, in the aftermath, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, of that specific attack, we made quite clear from this podium that there is a no justification for an act of violence like the attack that we saw carried out against the editors at Charlie Hebdo. \xc2\xa0And I feel confident in telling you that the Secretary of State strongly believes that sentiment. \xc2\xa0He certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s any justification for the kind of violence we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen perpetrated by terrorists either against people at Charlie Hebdo, or the kind of -- or the citizens of France in this most recent incident.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So why is he suggesting that there was a legitimacy or a rationale to those attacks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that he said the word legitimacy and then said that, well, --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And he said well not \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9crationale.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I have a couple of questions I want to ask you on a couple different subjects. \xc2\xa0First, I want to ask you about this issue of surveillance of the mosques -- certain mosques in this country that Donald Trump keeps reiterating. \xc2\xa0And he started it before the Paris attacks. \xc2\xa0What does this White House feel about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April, this may be a source of disappointment to you, but there are times where I\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to weigh in to the irresponsible rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s being spouted by Republican candidates for President, and times when I\xe2\x80\x99ve declined to do so. I think this is going to be one of those times when I\xe2\x80\x99m going to decline to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is a very serious time when there is a thought process that is seeming to be more vocal in this country about security issues that are trumping the principles of this country. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you that question, in all seriousness. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily about Donald Trump, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99s putting out there, and people are listening to it and actually embracing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to take a look at the comments that the President made at his news conference in Kuala Lumpur, where he was quite clear about the fact that language that is used to target or discriminate or specifically alienate Muslims only serves to advance the narrative -- the false narrative -- that ISIL is trying to write. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that the most important thing that the American people can do in the face of these shocking and scary images of violence that are being perpetrated by ISIL is to not be afraid and to not elevate them to a stature that they don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy into the fantasy that they\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to perpetuate that what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is important. \xc2\xa0In fact, what we should do is we should actually redouble our efforts to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re standing up for the values and principles and institutions that we cherish in this country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of response that the President would like to see from the American people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the truth is, it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the kind of response that we saw from the American people in the aftermath of the Boston bombing from a couple of years ago. \xc2\xa0We saw the people of Boston, in the face of a tragic, violent terrorist incident on one of the most special days of the year in Boston, we saw the people of Boston respond in the spirit of Boston Strong. \xc2\xa0And days later, they showed up at Fenway Park for a baseball game to sing the National Anthem. \xc2\xa0And a year later, they had a huge showing to watch another running of the Boston Marathon. \xc2\xa0And that really captures the spirit and resilience of the American people. \xc2\xa0And seeing the courage that has been on display by those who survived the attack, they are an example of -- a powerful example of the American spirit. \xc2\xa0And that should serve, frankly, as an inspiration to the American people, even in the face of these violent acts that ISIL has perpetrated on another Western city.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And along that line, last week I talked to former Virginia governor, Doug Wilder, who was asked about the fact that security is being pit against the principles of this country when it comes to immigrants and immigration, talking about the refugee issue with the Syrian refugees coming here. \xc2\xa0And he said that there was an aspect of discrimination as it relates to this controversy over the refugees. \xc2\xa0Does this White House feel the same about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, certainly there were some individuals who suggested that there should be a religious test imposed on our refugee program. \xc2\xa0And I think that would be a discriminatory practice that is inconsistent with the values that we have cherished since the forming of this country. \xc2\xa0So I guess from that standpoint, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a point to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last thing. \xc2\xa0Going back to Donald Trump, he basically told an activist for the Black Lives Matter movement to get out of his rally and he was roughed up. \xc2\xa0This White House has had members of grassroots organizations who include members of Black Lives Matter at the table to talk to them about issues going on. \xc2\xa0Is this now the time where candidates should talk to people, hear what they have to say, or is it the right thing to do to say \xe2\x80\x9cget out\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is not a departure from Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s habits. \xc2\xa0He has previously had reporters who were asking him tough questions removed from the room, so the fact that he might condone violence against a protestor is not particularly surprising to me. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not an approach that I would agree with, but he\xe2\x80\x99s running his own campaign and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, Josh, back to the Hollande meeting tomorrow. \xc2\xa0To what extent are the two leaders going to cover the situation -- the security preparations in Paris for the upcoming meeting of all these world leaders coming in? \xc2\xa0Or was that a non-issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, any time you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have that many world leaders in one place, security is obviously going to be an issue. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much of the meeting it will take up, but I anticipate that the ongoing security situation in the French capital will be a subject of some discussion, both in the days ahead but also in terms of the preparation that\xe2\x80\x99s underway to host leaders from around the world. \xc2\xa0And I think the President was quite resolute in his comments yesterday about how important it is for the world to send a clear message that, even in the face of this terrible violence, the business of the world and the business of saving the planet is going to move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there ever any consideration given here to the President not going to this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tJoe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0More on Hollande. \xc2\xa0We sort of assume that at least some of this meeting is going to be about Russia. \xc2\xa0My question to you, just to sort of start off, is, does the administration see Hollande here as sort of a mediation between the United States and Russia, especially given the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s going off to meet with Putin afterwards?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to President Hollande about what he plans to say to President Putin. \xc2\xa0Frankly, what President Obama is interested in doing is showing I think in a very visible way the solidarity that the United States of America feels with our allies in France, even in this very difficult hour for that country. \xc2\xa0This is a nation that\xe2\x80\x99s grieving. \xc2\xa0This a nation that\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the security situation inside their country. \xc2\xa0And they can and should take a lot of solace in knowing the most powerful country in the world has their back and is standing with them in this difficult time. And that will certainly be an important part of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think they\xe2\x80\x99ll also have some tangible conversations about what steps the United States is prepared to take to help them with the security situation in their country, particularly when it comes to intelligence sharing. \xc2\xa0We certainly believe that there is more that France and their European partners can do in terms of sharing information among themselves and with the United States, and we obviously would welcome steps that they would take to do that. \xc2\xa0We believe that would have a positive impact on a security situation not just in Europe but also in the United States. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate they\xe2\x80\x99ll also discuss how France can continue to ramp up their contribution to our counter-ISIL effort, including in the category of military contributions that France is prepared to make to this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What are the tangible steps that Russia would need to do in order to create more cooperation on the issue of ISIS?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, Joe, is that the Russians need to ensure that they have a military strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the diplomatic and political objectives that they themselves have identified. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s been the real problem that Russia has had, both in terms of pursuing their own strategy but also in terms of getting people to go along with it. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s this fundamental contradiction to what they say that their goals are and what they\xe2\x80\x99re actually doing on the ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact is, President Putin himself has acknowledged that the terrible problems that are plaguing Syria right now will require a political solution and a political transition. \xc2\xa0But as long as Russia is engaged in a significant military effort to prop up Bashar al-Assad, that is only going to make it more difficult for that political transition to actually take place. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to push that political solution further off into the distance, not bring it closer. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for out 65-member coalition. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also a problem for Russia. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President has tried to persuade President Putin directly, and I know that other world leaders have tried to do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see from Russia is a commitment to the kind of counter-ISIL-focused military effort that our coalition is carrying out. \xc2\xa0And particularly if Russia was prepared to integrate those efforts with the broader coalition efforts, then that would have a positive impact, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we would like to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is a rollback of economic sanctions over the Ukraine issue completely off the table? \xc2\xa0Or is there a way to sort of incrementally move in that direct to, at the very least, give Hollande something to take to Moscow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0President Obama and our European partners from the beginning have said that we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to roll back sanctions against Russia once they pursue and implement the Minsk agreement. \xc2\xa0And, unfortunately, we have seen Russia not take the steps that they have committed to take in the context of the Minsk agreement. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why those sanctions remain in place. \xc2\xa0They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t inhibit our ability to focus on other national security interests. \xc2\xa0For example, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t inhibit our ability to work with Russia to secure the agreement with Iran to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I do not envision a scenario in which sanctions relief is offered to Russia in exchange for greater contributions to ISIL. \xc2\xa0Russia already has a significant incentive to step up their efforts against ISIL. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we would like to see. \xc2\xa0But the kind of sanctions relief that we know that Russia would like to get is something that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get once they begin keeping their commitments that were made in the context of the Minsk agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last question. \xc2\xa0On the vetting process and the refugee programs -- on Capitol Hill, both Democrats and Republicans last week said that the administration had not done the finest job of selling the program in explaining it to the American public, explaining it on Capitol Hill, especially --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So they took a vote on a significant national security issue that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand? \xc2\xa0Is that right? \xc2\xa0I haven\'t seen anybody say that, but that would be news. \xc2\xa0So they didn\xe2\x80\x99t take time to read the bill? \xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t take time to understand the program?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of like health care. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, my question to you, though --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t heard anybody say that about health care.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- is does the administration feel as though it needed to do a better job of selling the finer points of the vetting process and making people understand it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think those who voted to further encumber the refugee process are accountable for their vote and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to explain why they voted in that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, my question to you is, the program as it stands now, was it not sold well enough? \xc2\xa0Were the finer points of it not sold well enough to people on Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, but again, is that an explanation for they voted against it, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what was included in it? \xc2\xa0I mean, that sort of goes to the substance of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- is that, oh, a bunch of members of Congress voted in a way that we obviously disagree with because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what they were voting on. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure if that\xe2\x80\x99s worse than just voting the wrong way, or if, unwittingly, they voted the wrong way.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing, Joe, that I think probably also is deserving of some attention. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also a certain level of irony associated with that step. \xc2\xa0We noted that voting to further encumber and bog down the refugee process is not likely to do much to improve the national security of the United States. \xc2\xa0There probably are some reforms to the visa waiver program that we\xe2\x80\x99re currently discussing with members of the United States Senate that actually could further enhance our national security. There are a number of steps the Department of Homeland Security has already taken over the last year to strengthen that program, and there may be some additional steps that we can work with Congress to implement that would strengthen that program.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing that Congress could do that would actually enhance our national security. \xc2\xa0And right now that relates to the purchase of firearms. \xc2\xa0Right now, there is not a law on the books that prevents an individual who is already in the United States and that we already know is suspected of having links to terrorism that allows him to go and purchase a weapon. \xc2\xa0This is particularly ironic because the concerns that were expressed by members of Congress -- some members of Congress -- was about individuals who are not in the United States and will be subjected to a process of spending two years convincing national security officials that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have links to terrorism. \xc2\xa0They will only enter the United States when they have persuaded those national security professionals sufficiently that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have links to terrorism. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut instead, members of Congress are prepared to allow those individuals who are already in the United States and are suspected of having links to terrorism from going and purchasing a firearm. \xc2\xa0And I think that is a pretty clear indication that Republicans in Congress are more interested in playing politics, and more scared of the NRA, than they are concerned about doing the right thing for our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tKelly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Staying on the refugee issue. \xc2\xa0We have at NBC a new survey that is out that 41 percent of those questioned support the idea of having Syrian refugees admitted to the country; 56 [percent] do not. \xc2\xa0And then if we add that on to the situation on Capitol Hill, where it was an overwhelming vote, including 47 Democrats, who wanted to have these additional restrictions of the vetting process, is the President not hearing where the public is on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kelly, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a pretty strong case about why what Congress did is not going to do much to improve our national security. \xc2\xa0It may make them feel better in terms of making a political argument, but that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an issue as important as our national security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, the reason that the President continues to support the refugee program is that individuals who enter the United States as a refugee are subjected to more screening and more vetting than anybody else who enters the United States. \xc2\xa0They have to submit to a background check. \xc2\xa0They have to submit to an in-person interview. \xc2\xa0They have biometric and biographical information that\xe2\x80\x99s collected and then run through a wide range of databases that are maintained by international criminal organizations -- or international law enforcement organizations, the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community, the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0And only then are they given the opportunity to enter to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince 2011, when the war in Syria broke out, about 22,000 Syrian individuals were referred to the United States to determine if they could qualify for refugee status and be admitted to the United States. \xc2\xa0These are individuals -- these 22,000 individuals had already been vetted by the United Nations for consideration in this program. \xc2\xa0A little more than 2,000 of them have been admitted to the United States. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of just how rigorous this process is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why further encumbering that process with even more bureaucracy may be effective as a political -- a piece of political rhetoric, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do anything to improve the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, if Congress were actually interested in doing that, they\xe2\x80\x99d pass a law that would prevent somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s on the Terror Watch List from being able to buy a gun. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what Congress could do. \xc2\xa0And as people are sitting around the Thanksgiving table talking about these issues -- as they should, and as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will all across the country -- I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s a question that will be raised and asked by members around the table, that if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a serious discussion in this country about national security, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about some pretty obvious things that Congress can do. \xc2\xa0And one obvious thing that Congress can do is pass a law that prevents somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s on the Terror Watch List from being able to buy a weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why that\xe2\x80\x99s even controversial. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been done so far. \xc2\xa0I suspect, however, that has a lot to do with the fear that Republicans have of the NRA.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You think it\xe2\x80\x99s fear on the part of those Democrats, though, who also sided with Republicans in voting that way last week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Maybe. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, is there any concern that if President Obama does not have some specific -- you did mention \xe2\x80\x9ctangible\xe2\x80\x9d -- but something specific to offer the French President that when he does then go on to Russia, is it possible that Vladimir Putin will see that as an opportunity to try to outdo President Obama on close proximity, judging sort of these two meetings almost side by side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When you consider the substantial coalition that the United States has built and led, and the substantial contribution that we have made to the variety of lines of effort, it will require a remarkable commitment from Russia to try to match our efforts. \xc2\xa0But if that\xe2\x80\x99s what they want to do, if Russia is prepared to commit the kinds of resources that the United States has in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated with the international community to defeating ISIL, we\xe2\x80\x99d welcome that contribution.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason this has to be a competition. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have their contribution be added to the list. \xc2\xa0And if it\xe2\x80\x99s as sizable as the contribution that the United States has made, we surely would welcome it.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two questions, please. \xc2\xa0Do you have any confirmation that Qassem Soleimani was wounded -- do you have any confirmation on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some sporadic reports about this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to confirm them at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just on April\xe2\x80\x99s question, Mr. Trump also didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that Muslim Americans should carry identification cards, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out also that they can be entered into a special database. \xc2\xa0Considering that the President has many Muslim members serving in his Cabinet and the administration, and there are many Muslim Americans who serve in the armed forces and dying for this country, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it should be addressed directly, talking to Muslim Americans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I certainly -- well, let me just start, Nadia, by saying that Mr. Trump and other Republicans on the campaign trail have said a number of outrageous things. \xc2\xa0And to not criticize them directly for doing so is not to condone that kind of rhetoric. \xc2\xa0Certainly I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the President spoke quite eloquently about how important it is for this country to, even in the face of this terrible violence that we saw perpetrated on the people of Paris, that even in the face of those shocking images -- that our response should not be to walk away from our values. \xc2\xa0In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reason to redouble our efforts to fight for our values.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President is confident that that represents the character of America. \xc2\xa0And that certainly has been the kind of reaction that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the vast majority of Americans, and that is the kind of reaction that represents the way that millions of Americans who are Muslim live their lives. \xc2\xa0It certainly is a testament to the values of the American people, including American Muslims.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s important because, as I mentioned earlier, it undermines the narrative that ISIL is seeking to advance. \xc2\xa0The fact is that there are millions of Muslims in this country who practice their religion freely, and they raise their kids, they send them to schools -- they are able to live the American Dream because of the opportunity that they\xe2\x80\x99re given in this country. \xc2\xa0And fighting for their continued ability to do that and to not be discriminated against just because of the way they worship God is consistent with the values of this country, and important to our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, with the climate conference coming up, is the President optimistic about getting a comprehensive deal that will be significant and verifiable and really carry through into the future to adequately address climate change?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Pam, the President is certainly optimistic, based on the significant commitments we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen, 90 percent of the countries who emit carbon or at least -- or I should say that differently -- the President is optimistic, based on the significant contributions and commitments we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that have been made by countries around the world. \xc2\xa0These countries account for about 90 percent of the carbon that\xe2\x80\x99s emitted around the world, and that represents a substantial starting point for negotiations that could yield an important agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately what we want to see is we want to see the kind of agreement that is both ambitious but also verifiable. \xc2\xa0And these will be discussions in Paris that will take place that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will have lots of ups and downs and there will be periods over the course of that 10- or 12-day conference where I\xe2\x80\x99ll be standing here answering questions about the talks being poised to fail -- and those will be fun days. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all will enjoy them as much as I will.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think everybody who is participating in the conference understands the stakes are high. \xc2\xa0That certainly was true of all of the conversations that the President has had over the last week with leaders of countries, large and small, who represent -- or who understand that the time for action is now. \xc2\xa0And there is an opportunity for the world to do something important to fight climate change and to reduce carbon pollution in a way that has positive consequences for the health of our kids and for our economy -- because we know that the kinds of investments that the United States has already made in clean and renewable energy are likely to become more valuable as other countries follow through on their commitment to consider alternative sources of energy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on a different subject, Secretary Kerry said that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for ideas -- military, counterterrorism, and diplomatic ideas that would help defeat ISIS faster. \xc2\xa0Is that a sign that the President might be willing to change his strategy? Or is he referring to other members of the coalition and what they could do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Pam, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said is that the President is prepared to intensify our efforts in those areas where we know our strategy is showing signs of progress, and whether that is in providing additional equipment and reinforcements to those local forces on the ground that are making progress against ISIL, or intensifying our air campaign in the same way that the French have committed to do, or redoubling our efforts around a diplomatic effort. \xc2\xa0This has always been the way that we have approached this issue, which is to try to intensify our focus on those areas where our strategy is showing progress and acknowledge those areas that aren\xe2\x80\x99t working as well as we had hoped. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we will have even more confidence in our strategy as more resources are mobilized by our coalition partners, and that was the subject of extensive discussion in a number of the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation over the last week and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that will be the case in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0At the U.N. this year, the President talked about the dangers of leaving a vacuum in a country after removing an authoritarian leader -- obviously talking about Libya. \xc2\xa0Does this administration currently have a plan for the post-Assad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Olivier, this is actually the subject of ongoing discussion that Secretary Kerry has been leading in Vienna over the last several weeks. \xc2\xa0What is clear is that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0The vast majority of the citizens of that country no longer have confidence in his ability to keep the country together and to lead them in a direction that they support. \xc2\xa0In large part, that\xe2\x80\x99s because President Assad has used the military of that country to attack his own people. \xc2\xa0That certainly would be one way to undermine confidence in your leadership. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has been pretty blunt about the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that his actions -- that President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s actions are morally repugnant -- he\xe2\x80\x99s attacked innocent civilians -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s also that he, as a practical matter, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost the support of the people. \xc2\xa0And so he can\xe2\x80\x99t lead that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the nature of the ongoing discussions in Vienna over the last several weeks has been to figure out how to put in place the milestones for a political transition. \xc2\xa0And what they have essentially said is that the countries with a stake in this have essentially agreed to support a strategy that would bring parties together no later than January 1st to begin those discussions. \xc2\xa0And that would also -- what would also take place simultaneously is a ceasefire. \xc2\xa0And hopefully that would lay the groundwork for negotiations and eventually a vote. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, the President has acknowledged -- and we said this on many occasions and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it yet today -- the United States, despite our significant military commitment, will not succeed in imposing a military solution on the situation in Syria. \xc2\xa0No matter how substantial the military contributions are from the United States and our coalition partners, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution that\xe2\x80\x99s going to succeed here. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a diplomatic and political one.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur military strategy is predicated on taking out ISIL leaders and preventing them from establishing a safe haven. \xc2\xa0But if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to address the root cause of the problems inside of Syria, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require a political transition and that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult work when you consider all of the different interests that are at stake here. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why there are some 20-odd -- 22 countries around the negotiating table, including countries with rather diverse interests, like Saudi Arabia and Iran. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut yet it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the leadership of the United States -- and Secretary Kerry deserves a lot of credit for this -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in getting everybody to the same room to begin having these conversations. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s because, despite their differing opinions and their differing levels of commitment to that country, all of them acknowledge that a political transition is necessary to address a situation that has had negative consequences for all of the countries involved. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the American envoy to the OPCW -- the organization in charge of overseeing the destruction of chemical weapons -- the American envoy today said that the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict is \xe2\x80\x9cbecoming routine.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0How does the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy handle that, handle this apparently routine use of chemical weapons? \xc2\xa0And do you know and can you say whether these are Assad caches that were missed a couple of years ago or whether this is new production?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Olivier, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the comments of our OPCW representative so I may have to get back to you on this thing. \xc2\xa0I mean, I think the one thing that is true is that there were I believe hundreds of tons of chemical weapons that were in President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s stockpile that were effectively identified, removed, and destroyed by the United States, working closely with Russia. \xc2\xa0And that was a significant accomplishment because we know that had those materials not been removed and destroyed, the risk associated with chemical weapons would be even greater inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for the response of the specific comments that have been shared I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one. \xc2\xa0Then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to call it a day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0About Assad. \xc2\xa0The Syrian rebels are not at the table for these talks, and they are saying, look, he\xe2\x80\x99s a war criminal, he needs to be in jail. \xc2\xa0You can have as many talks as you want, but that\xe2\x80\x99s our position and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing from. \xc2\xa0So how far can these talks realistically go as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re not involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Victoria, the goal of these conversations is for the countries in the region and around the world who have an interest in resolving the situation inside of Syria agreeing to an approach that would eventually include bringing the opposition together. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for you to understand is that the opposition is far from monolithic. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of different organizations and groups that are involved that presumably would like to have some kind of say in the future of Syria. \xc2\xa0So this is a complex process and getting them to participate in that process and getting them around the negotiating table is only a first step. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would acknowledge that we\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from the kind of political solution that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue but necessary, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that if you can get countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia around the table discussing this and coming to at least the broad outlines of a framework for pursuing this kind of political transition, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant development. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to go, and certainly resolving or at least addressing the wide variety of concerns that are sure to be aired by opposition groups once they get in the room -- that will sort of be the next challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99ll face here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the talks tomorrow -- is there a difference between President Obama and President Hollande on the timeframe for the removal of Assad? \xc2\xa0It seems that Hollande may be more pragmatic as to when Assad needs to go. \xc2\xa0I sense more urgency from you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear more directly from President Hollande about his views on this. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear that this political transition is going to need to end with President Assad leaving power. \xc2\xa0And, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got significant moral concerns about the way that he has led that country -- and based more specifically, by the way, that he\xe2\x80\x99s attacked innocent civilians in that country -- but just as a practical matter, he is not able to lead the country. \xc2\xa0The vast majority of the citizens of that country don\xe2\x80\x99t support him and have been the victims of his attacks.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see a political transition in place to resolve the political problems that are plaguing that country. \xc2\xa0And I think, look, despite the wide variety of opinions that are represented in that room in Vienna, I think everybody has come to terms with that fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0Have a good Monday. \xc2\xa0The President will be doing a news conference with President Hollande tomorrow after their bilateral meeting. \xc2\xa0That will be in the late morning tomorrow, last I heard. \xc2\xa0We will not do a briefing on Wednesday so I wish all of you a very happy Thanksgiving. \xc2\xa0Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:29 P.M.
