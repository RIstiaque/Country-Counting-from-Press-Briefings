EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the great state of Ohio.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us.\xc2\xa0 As we have been doing of late, Jen and I will be briefing together.\xc2\xa0 I can take questions related to policy, the presidency, the administration, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Jen can take your questions on the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Where questions contain elements that each of us can respond to, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I turn it over to Jen to give a topper, I just wanted to mention that today the World Trade Organization is announcing another clear win for the United States in a trade dispute with China -- this time over so-called \xe2\x80\x9celectronic payment systems\xe2\x80\x9d like credit and debit cards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Obama administration launched this case in 2010.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s win highlights that tackling unfair Chinese trade practices has been a priority of this President throughout his term in office.\xc2\xa0 That is precisely why 3.5 years into the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term we have doubled the rate of WTO cases against China versus the prior administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can answer more questions about that, the details of which may be interesting to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will turn over the top to Jen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 In his remarks today in Cincinnati, President Obama will highlight a new report that it was issued in tax notes -- I have copies of it here if anyone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a copy -- that indicates that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s support for a tax system that would eliminate taxes on U.S. companies\xe2\x80\x99 foreign profits would create 800,000 jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 This could impact places like Cincinnati.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, the President will be talking about it in his remarks today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Romney campaign is upping the heat about so-called crony capitalism.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re talking not only about familiar cases like Solyndra, but also some other cases like Westly and First Wind.\xc2\xa0 Is the President vulnerable on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a -- can I just do the policy part first?\xc2\xa0 This President will not concede the industries of the 21st century to China, India, Europe and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 The investments made in the Recovery Act have already helped renewable energy production double in the United States.\xc2\xa0 They have helped created thousands -- tens of thousands of jobs in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And they have helped build a foundation for competition in vital industries in the 21st century, for competition that will allow for the creation of American jobs in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe alternative is to cede those industries to other countries, because the 21st century will be very much focused on the development of clean energy technologies and the utilization of the clean energy technologies.\xc2\xa0 So you have a choice.\xc2\xa0 You either make the investments to ensure that those jobs are created in the United States, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you decide that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be importing not just foreign oil but foreign clean energy technologies.\xc2\xa0 This President will not do that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Jen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that people who contribute money to the campaign or help the campaign in other ways are rewarded with loans and grants for these types of energy programs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has set a bar of transparency that Mitt Romney has not met, cannot possibly meet even on his tippy toes.\xc2\xa0 We have released bundlers regularly.\xc2\xa0 We release people who visit the White House.\xc2\xa0 We release far more than Mitt Romney has come close to.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage anyone to ask the Romney campaign to provide a list of their bundlers.\xc2\xa0 The only reason we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing this is because of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s high level of transparency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say that on the points that Mitt Romney is attempting to make, these are old, tired, haggard attacks, and they -- we know what tactically they\'re trying to do, which is change the conversation, because he doesn\'t want to answer questions about his time at Bain Capital, as over the weekend new information continued to come out, raising additional questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Mitt Romney, as well, it should not come as any surprise either that given President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s strong record on clean energy, which Jay touched on, that there would be supporters who have contributed to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 This is an area, as Jay touched on, that we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to not only pushing forward, but the President will be talking about his commitment to clean energy on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just because you reveal or divulge donors doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a connection between federal grants and loans and help for the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was just going to say there\xe2\x80\x99s been a substantial amount of time and energy spent in the House of Representatives investigating this, and they have come out with exactly zero evidence of any kind of improper behavior with regards to this.\xc2\xa0 And rather than focusing on creating jobs and helping the economy grow, the House of Representatives, in particular, has spent a great deal of time focusing on these kinds of investigations that have led nowhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing that, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act 33 time -- again, a use of their time as America\xe2\x80\x99s representatives in the House and in Congress that I think most Americans would think was ill spent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And just one thing to add.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage also anyone to take a look at Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s record when he was the governor of Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s treading on thin ice here, and I would encourage all of you to take a look at the kind of bundler -- the kind of donors he had, the contracts that were given, and take a look and see what you find there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJust to add to what Jay said, in addition to the congressional investigation, there\xe2\x80\x99s been countless fact checks from media organizations about these accusations over the course of the last six months that we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to provide as needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick change of subject before you come back to this, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- North Korea, one of the top military officials in the country has been pushed out of -- pushed out.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Do you see any significance that the new leader there is beginning to assert himself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any comment on the specific personnel move that you referred to.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the way we address the issue of policy towards North Korea has to do with holding North Korea accountable to its international obligations and judging North Korea by its actions, and not spending a lot of time trying to read into personnel moves in what is one of the world\'s most opaque governments and societies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, the Romney campaign\xe2\x80\x99s poster has a memo out saying that despite all of the attacks -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty relentless -- that the race is tightening, not widening; the gap is tightening in his favor, therefore they\'re not working.\xc2\xa0 Do you have evidence to the contrary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve all known that once Mitt Romney became the nominee that there would be a bump in support for his candidacy.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\'re a couple weeks into that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve always known the race would be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that for a while now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 -- the race would be close.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve always said that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re exactly where we want to be.\xc2\xa0 We\'re traveling to Ohio today, where if you talk to people in the crowd I will promise you people will bring up outsourcing and Mitt Romney\'s record on outsourcing and their concerns about that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on running a state-to-state campaign.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\'re in Ohio today, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\'re going to Florida later this week.\xc2\xa0 And I will tell you, we\'re exactly where we want to be, which is with field organizers on the ground, volunteers building, opening more offices.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where our focus is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you point any evidence that these questions that you\'re raising about Romney is taking a toll on him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen in state-by-state polls, especially in places like Ohio, that people have started to question Mitt Romney\'s business credentials, which he\'s been leading with, as the reason -- the number-one qualification for his presidency.\xc2\xa0 People are questioning what he did at Bain, what these investments were.\xc2\xa0 People want to know more about his time there and what decisions he was involved in.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe saw over the weekend that Bill Kristol and Haley Barbour both suggested, called on him to release his tax returns.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s created this cloud of secrecy around his campaign that I promise you people in states across the country are very concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you started off giving us a -- sort of highlighting a WTO decision against China, I think you said on debit and credit cards.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the last time you guys were in Ohio there was a WTO complaint that was filed by the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Do you all see that the message of wins -- these are clear wins against China resonate particularly well in a state like Ohio that has strong auto industry ties?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President feels very strongly that taking action to ensure that American companies and American workers are able to compete on a level playing field with China and other countries is something that resonates across the country with Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis particular announcement that I brought up at the top of the briefing was made by the WTO.\xc2\xa0 It has nothing -- the timing is not ours, but it is newsworthy today.\xc2\xa0 And this relates to one of the six prior cases that the United States has filed at the WTO against China under President Obama.\xc2\xa0 The other action that you referenced refers to the seventh new initiative that this administration has filed at the WTO against China.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to add one thing about the town hall today -- this is the first town hall.\xc2\xa0 Some people have asked me this.\xc2\xa0 So first town hall of the general election.\xc2\xa0 The tickets were distributed at three field offices around Cincinnati, free and open to the public.\xc2\xa0 Let me know if you have any other questions on that front, but just so you\'re all aware.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three field offices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Three field offices in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- first come, first serve?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the White House putting out some information on the WTO case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get more information available to you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that we have a lot more on it.\xc2\xa0 It has to do with -- I can tell you this, that the heart of the case involves a Chinese prohibition on foreign companies handling credit and debit card payments in China, instead requiring that they go through one single domestic entity -- China Union Pay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToday\'s win shows our determination to go after China\'s efforts to distort global trade rules, including by creating domestic "national champions" like China Union Pay.\xc2\xa0 And it will benefit jobs and companies here at home.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- the case itself was filed in 2010.\xc2\xa0 This is another judgment in the U.S.\'s favor with regards to this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The field office -- if someone walks in off the street who has not worked for the campaign and the campaign is not familiar with them, they could get a ticket?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the numbers yet, but we\'ll get you that information as soon as we get there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:38 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
