EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. TROTTER:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.\xc2\xa0 This conference call is to discuss the Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden\xe2\x80\x99s trip next week to Chile and the Dominican Republic.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis call is on background and all of our speakers should be referred to as senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll speak for a few minutes and then take some of your questions.\xc2\xa0 And with that I will turn it over to our first senior administration official.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to take a couple of minutes to give some broad outlines, and then turn it over to my colleague to go into the substance, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll look forward to taking a few of your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President and Dr. Biden will travel to Chile and the Dominican Republic from March 9th to the 12th.\xc2\xa0 In Chile, the Vice President will attend the inauguration of Michelle Bachelet, who he met back in March of 2009, in Santiago, first, to underscore the historically close ties between the United States and Chile; and, second, because this inauguration represents an important gathering of leaders from across the region and provides an opportunity for him to engage with a broad range of presidents and other senior officials on some of the most important issues facing the Americas today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith Bachelet, the Vice President looks forward to discussing a range of issues in our bilateral relationship with Chile, including the TransPacific Partnership, the U.N. Security Council, of which Chile is a non-permanent member; 100,000 Strong in the Americas; and a number of other issues, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then he will also look forward to speaking with leaders from President Humala of Peru, to President Santos of Colombia, to President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico, to other figures from across South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMost importantly, perhaps, thanks to the U.S. Senate, the Vice President will be accompanied by our just-confirmed ambassador to the Republic of Chile, Mike Hammer.\xc2\xa0 And we thank the Senate for moving on his confirmation yesterday so that Ambassador Hammer could join us for this trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the Dominican Republic, the Vice President and President Medina have a lot of issues to discuss, both bilaterally and regionally, and also to lift up and celebrate the very close people-to-people ties between the United States and the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 More than a million and a half Dominicans and their descendants live in the United States, and more than 250,000 U.S. citizens live in the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 And you see a million and a half or so U.S. tourists visiting the Dominican Republic every year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a signatory of the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, we enjoy very close trade ties with the DR.\xc2\xa0 And the DR is an important voice in issues facing Caribbean countries, as well as Central American countries, as the current president of SICA, the Central American Integration System.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President will place particular emphasis on the issue of energy security while he\xe2\x80\x99s in the Dominican Republic, given the challenges and opportunities that have been created in recent years in the region, and our deep investment in making sure that all the countries of the Caribbean and the broad region are able to access secure, stable, and affordable supplies of energy to power their economies and provide better lives for their people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJust to step back for one second, before my colleague gets into some of more of the details, this trip continues both the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s active engagement in the Americas and in the Western Hemisphere over the past year and beyond.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJust in early December, President Santos of Colombia was here to meet with the President in the Oval; and just a couple of weeks ago, the President attended the North American Leaders Summit in Toluca.\xc2\xa0 And this trip will mark the seventh trip the Vice President has taken since 2009, and will be a part of the active pace of travel and meetings and telephone calls you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from him -- the early part of last year.\xc2\xa0 It is a way in traveling to these two countries to continue to underscore and emphasize and make concrete this administration\xe2\x80\x99s strong commitment to elevated and intensified engagement with the Americas and with leaders and peoples across the Americas, and to advance our vision of an Americas that is middle class, secure, and democratic from Canada to Chile, and everywhere in between.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, let me turn it over to my colleague.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining this call.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to hit a couple of the details in our relations with Chile and the Dominican Republic that are going to figure in our conversations and our relationship over the next year and several years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the case of Chile, President Obama and Vice President Biden have the utmost admiration and respect for President Bachelet, dating back from her first term as Chilean President, and more recent -- first executive director of U.N. Women.\xc2\xa0 We look very much forward to working with her in her new term as President.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had an excellent relationship with outgoing President Pi\xc3\xb1era as well, as indicated by President Pi\xc3\xb1era\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the United States for a meeting with the President in 2013.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChile is one of our closest partners in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Our 2004 free trade agreement made our economies increasingly interconnected and allowed us to nearly quadruple our bilateral trade and goods to $28 billion last year.\xc2\xa0 Chile is our fourth largest export partner in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo for this reason, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to us to have Chile as a participant in the negotiations for the TransPacific Partnership, which my colleague just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 The TPP negotiations are almost complete, and given our close relationship and the integration of our economies, both Chile and the United States should be big beneficiaries of the TPP\xe2\x80\x99s successful conclusion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not just our economies that are interconnected, it\xe2\x80\x99s also our people.\xc2\xa0 Last week, Chile became the 38th country to be designated as a participant in the visa waiver program.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to help speed, accelerate, and deepen the already very close relations between our two countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnother area where there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal of cooperation and collaboration and definitely room for additional expanded growth is in education.\xc2\xa0 Educational exchange is a way that we see as deepening our lasting personal ties as well as our close economic ties.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a priority issue for President Obama, for President-Elect Bachelet, and of course, for the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 And we hope to leverage our 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to increase the number of U.S. students studying in Chile.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the Vice President recently helped launched the next phase of 100,000 Strong, and so it\xe2\x80\x99s very timely for him to be going to Chile now, where we have some of our closest educational partnerships.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also have, beyond the bilateral connections, a very close relationship with Chile in the multilateral world.\xc2\xa0 We consult very often, regularly, on global issues of course with Chile as a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a continuing element of collaboration between our countries, but also, President Obama and President-Elect Bachelet launched our Trilateral Development Cooperation initiative in 2009, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked together in countries as diverse as El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic on matters as diverse as agriculture, assisting at-risk youth, and security cooperation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn addition, Chile has been a long-standing contributor to the U.N. stabilization mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH, contributing about 700 police and military.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be another area where we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work closely with Chile.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo turning to the Dominican Republic, as my colleague mentioned, they are very, very strong, familial and personal connections between the people of the United States and the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been reinforced by the implementation of CAFTA-DR, our free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 We have new ideas we\xe2\x80\x99d like to pursue with the Dominican government on cooperation related to the economy, energy, education, and security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of our security and law enforcement cooperation, we have an excellent, very good collaboration with Dominican authorities.\xc2\xa0 We have cooperated with the Dominican Republic in helping them set up a 911 program in Santo Domingo, and we\xe2\x80\x99re also looking beyond security issues at assisting the Dominican Republic on issues related to citizen security, but also education, the prevention and the spread of HIV/AIDS, reducing the vulnerability to climate change and strengthening government institutions.\xc2\xa0 USAID will invest about $185 million in the Dominican Republic over the next five years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo another item for discussion certainly will be the -- matters related to the Constitutional Tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s decision in the Dominican Republic related to nationality law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an area where the United States has engaged with the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 We are hopeful that there will be a conclusion to this matter through legislation that will address those most affected by that ruling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn energy issues, we have lots of collaboration already.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in expanding our leadership role and collaboration not just the United States, but also by working with Canada, Mexico, and other partners to help address some of the distortions and market issues that have affected the distribution of energy in the Caribbean.\xc2\xa0 As my colleague mentioned, this is an area that\xe2\x80\x99s important to us, because we see it as key to improving the competitiveness of the Caribbean and for Central America, for that matter, in the global economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, finally, President Medina is currently serving as the President Pro Tempore of the Central American Integration System, SICA, through June of 2014.\xc2\xa0 We want to continue the conversation that President Obama launched with SICA leaders in May of last year in Costa Rica, and again with the ultimate goal of promoting regional integration that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very important to the Caribbean and Central America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to compete in the global economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Just before we open it up for questions, I wanted to highlight the fact that as I said at the outset of the goal, Dr. Biden will be joining the Vice President in both Chile and the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 And she will participate in some of the inauguration activities in Chile, and also pursue some of her own events and activities in both Chile and the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide more details on that in the next day or so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, this is FOX News Latino.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the Vice President will be discussing any matters regarding to the unrest in Venezuela with either President-Elect Bachelet, or with President Santos in Colombia, or President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto in Mexico?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me start -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleague by saying that Venezuela will be at or near the top of the agenda in all of these bilateral meetings, the concerns that the entire region has about the unrest and the challenges there.\xc2\xa0 In terms of more specifics on that, let me turn it over to my colleague.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think the entire region has shown concern regarding events in Venezuela, particularly to the arrest of people for freely expressing their views and for exercising their right to freedom of assembly, among other issues.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that the view of the United States is that the outcome -- a successful outcome is going to require third party mediations.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support any efforts to achieve the release of people arrested in this upsurge, and also to call on the government to halt its practice really of demonizing the opposition and of allowing essentially vigilante groups to intimidate and use violence against people who are peacefully demonstrating against the government.\xc2\xa0 So with that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And we expect the Vice President will speak to this issue in regional media in the run-up to the trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is it for the U.S. to address the constitutional crisis (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 And what should the American government have done about it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t clearly hear the call.\xc2\xa0 But I understand it has to do with the Constitutional Tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 So let me address that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst of all, we recognize that every country has the sovereign right to determine its nationality laws and its domestic legislation.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the constitutional court ruling, we\'ve conveyed our deep concern to the government of the Dominican Republic regarding the impact on the citizenship status of persons living in the Dominican Republic, including those with longstanding either residence or close ties to the Dominican Republic.\xc2\xa0 Our understanding is that perhaps as many as 200,000 people could be affected by this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'ve engaged at senior levels with Dominican authorities who\xe2\x80\x99ve been very transparent with us in discussing their approach to this and their desire to achieve a resolution that is nondiscriminatory and that reflects the need to have a just solution for people who have longstanding ties and connections to the Dominican Republic, and also to not further those groups that are already in a condition of vulnerability or that would be at risk in other senses, or deny them documentation and the ability to fully participate in the country -- they belong and where they live.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is something that is important not just to us, but other members of the international community, and it\'s something that we\'ve worked very closely on with a number of partners.\xc2\xa0 And we know that other actors are also very active in dealing with this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. TROTTER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everyone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:17 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
