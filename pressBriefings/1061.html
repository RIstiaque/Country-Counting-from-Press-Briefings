EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to your daily briefing at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements, so I go to the Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Given that White House officials have said that you worked with Senate Democrats on their millionaire surtax proposal, has the White House also been working with congressional Republicans on changes to the pay-fors? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure -- that question doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense to me.\xc2\xa0 We are interested in Congress taking up, in the Senate and in the House, the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased, obviously, that the Senate will be taking up the President\xe2\x80\x99s American Jobs Act next week.\xc2\xa0 We hope that the House will do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we are -- to answer your question broadly, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, we are in communication with Congress -- both parties, both houses; leadership, both parties, both houses -- in general about the agenda going forward this fall.\xc2\xa0 And the primary -- the highest priority on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda is the American Jobs Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So regarding the Senate bill, or the process in the Senate -- and this would apply to the House -- we have said all along, from the very beginning, that we are open to different ways of paying for the very important, broadly supported measures in the American Jobs Act that would grow the economy and create jobs, and of course we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with the Senate as they\xe2\x80\x99ve settled on a way to pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be true, too, in the House.\xc2\xa0 If the House -- if the obstacle in the House to taking up the full measure is coming up with a way to pay for it, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times from this podium, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have those discussions, as long as -- but the principles have to be met here.\xc2\xa0 It has to be paid for in a way that is balanced and fair; that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put the burden on the middle class, which has borne such a substantial burden, both of the Great Recession and the essentially middle-class -- what was essentially middle-class stagnation for the decade prior to it -- or on seniors through voucherization of Medicare or any other segment of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s belief and approach is based on the idea that those who have succeeded in this country, in this great country of ours, should pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0 And when we have to make choices between taking measures that create jobs and put teachers back to work and construction workers back to work and put -- through tax cuts, put money in every working American\xe2\x80\x99s pocket and give tax cuts to small businesses so that they can grow and hire, or giving preferential tax treatment to the wealthiest Americans -- the President thinks the choice is clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if there\xe2\x80\x99s a way that the House wants to approach this that reflects those principles, we are more than willing to have that discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, though.\xc2\xa0 When you said that the White House has also been in discussions with Republican leaders, does that mean that the White House has talked with McConnell about -- or Boehner about the millionaire surtax?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific conversations.\xc2\xa0 There is an obsession with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we know that you have been in conversations with Democrats.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- with process that the American people, the consumers of your product, do not care very much about.\xc2\xa0 What they want is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about process, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not, though, because there\xe2\x80\x99s an impression -- if all we know is that the White House is dealing with Democrats and not Republicans, then it gives off an impression that the objective is to rally a unified Democratic Party and set the Republicans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just -- let me just -- no, no.\xc2\xa0 I said the other day, we would be elated if the result of this process were passage of the American Jobs Act, in its entirety, all the component parts --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What process? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What process?\xc2\xa0 You said the result of this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but if the idea that our goal here is to use this as a political weapon -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Our goal is to take action to put Americans back to work and to deal with our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, we can\xe2\x80\x99t be casual.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t be sitting back, hoping that things get better.\xc2\xa0 This President believes that we are in a precarious situation in our economy as we continue to struggle to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 We have an employment crisis that continues to need to be -- needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And it is simply not an option to do nothing.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not an option to pass measures that, even if they were all the right things to do -- and we certainly debate that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the House Republican proposals -- no economist -- serious economist, independent economist, would suggest that those measures would have a direct, immediate impact on growth or job creation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The problem is, we need to take measures to address our short -- medium-term and long-term economic health and fiscal health, but we also have to do things right now to address our short-term problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to back up again, we are -- we will, as this process goes forward, be more than willing to have discussions with the leaders in the House, of both parties, about how we can move this legislation forward in the House.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to those discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you waiting for them to come to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the -- look, the Majority Leader of the House, as the President noted yesterday, declared preemptively that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even going to bring it up to a vote.\xc2\xa0 Well, we just think that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 What is it that he opposes in this bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the process?\xc2\xa0 To go back to his question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why not -- well, look, bring it up for a vote, and if we then get to a point where we can -- where we need to move on individual provisions within the jobs act, then let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re paid for in a way that meets the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles, he will sign them into law and then say, where\xe2\x80\x99s the rest?\xc2\xa0 Because all of these provisions are essential for the health of the economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we are aggressively pursuing this because we think it is absolutely the best thing for the American economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just ask one question on the substance of the Senate Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 proposal?\xc2\xa0 It sounds like this surtax would start January 1, 2012.\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable with the idea of raising taxes on a percentage of Americans at a time of economic uncertainty?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- I confess that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t studied the provision to that level of detail.\xc2\xa0 So I would just say in general that we believe that the jobs provisions, the economic growth provisions in the American Jobs Act need to be paid for -- that was the principle the President set out from the beginning, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the legislation he sent up contained within it provisions that paid for it entirely -- and that in doing so, you need to do it in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair and balanced, and that puts the burden not on the middle class and not on seniors and other sectors of our society who have borne such a heavy burden in the recent past.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re open to different ideas.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has put forward -- Senate Democrats have put forward a different idea that we think would work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The important part -- the important aspect of this is, is that the bill they will vote on is the President\xe2\x80\x99s bill in its entirety, in terms of putting teachers back to work, up to 280,000 laid-off teachers around the country, up to a total of 400,000 teachers overall; putting construction workers who are idle back to work building bridges, rebuilding schools, highways; putting $1,500 on average into working Americans\xe2\x80\x99 pockets next year through the payroll tax cut and expansion; a tax cut for small business so that they can grow and hire; incentives for small business -- rather, for all businesses to hire our incredibly talented and experienced veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are all provisions that will be contained in what the Senate votes on, and we think should get 100 votes in the Senate, because they are all -- first of all, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid for in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair, that the vast majority of the American people support.\xc2\xa0 And there are provisions that absolutely make sense at this time of economic need -- when we need to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate is expected to take up -- to vote on the China currency bill tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 You have said several times that the administration shares the goal of China letting its currency appreciate, but the House Speaker has called it a dangerous overreach by Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration share that concern, that this might -- compelling another country to appreciate its currency might be an overstep?\xc2\xa0 And where are you on the -- is the administration on its review?\xc2\xa0 When can we expect that to be completed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me answer this way -- that we share the goal, as you noted, of this legislation in taking action to ensure that our workers and businesses have a more level playing field with the Chinese, including addressing the undervaluation of their currency. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is also the case that aspects of this legislation do, however, raise concerns about consistency with our international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we are in the process of discussing those issues with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 If this legislation were to advance, those concerns should be addressed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to restate:\xc2\xa0 We share the goals, we share the concern about the need for our workers and businesses to be able to compete on a level playing field; we have, from the beginning, as an administration, worked on the issue of the undervalued Chinese currency, and it has appreciated to some degree as a result, we think, of those efforts.\xc2\xa0 More needs to be done, and we certainly also have concerns about this particular legislation and whether or not it would create consistency issues with our international obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you explain more about the consistency issue?\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we have a series of international obligations that we adhere to, and that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want legislation that would be less than effective because it conflicted with our international obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that this could lead to a trade war, as the Chinese have said it might?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s speculation that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to engage in.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking with members of Congress about it.\xc2\xa0 We will -- if this legislation were to advance and emerge from Congress, we would continue to talk with members about the need to address these concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the review is done, and this is the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the process is ongoing, obviously, as it\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And our conversations about it will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, what was -- sorry, one other quick subject.\xc2\xa0 The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced in coming days.\xc2\xa0 The President said when he was awarded his Nobel Peace Prize, in October 2009, that he was humbled by it, that he felt it was more of a call to action than a reward for actions that he had actually taken.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that at this stage he has earned his Nobel, given the current --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that that is not a conversation probably any of us have had with him, because he does not think about it in those terms at all.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s focused -- as concerns matters of war and peace, and of national security and the need to protect the United States and advance our interests around the globe, he takes an approach that he thinks increases American stature, enhances our security, and enhances our opportunities to affect events globally in a way that increases the prospects for peoples around the world to enjoy democracy and peace and freedom. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken with the uprisings in the Middle East, in the Arab Spring.\xc2\xa0 It is the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken around the world.\xc2\xa0 And it is a component part of the approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to ensuring that he does everything he can, as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief, to take the fight to those who would do harm to Americans and the United States and our allies, principally al Qaeda, and to ensure that we are, through all our means, advancing American interests around the globe in a way that both protects us and improves our cooperative relationships with our allies and partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He feels like he has promoted peace in the two years since he was awarded --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he has promoted a foreign policy and a national security policy that he believes has been in the best interests of the American people, and judgments about -- like that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to others to make when he leaves office in about six years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President -- and the White House in general -- are not talking to Republicans in the way they did during the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you guys all get a memo in the morning to, like -- \xe2\x80\x9cRemember to ask Jay about meetings that should be happening\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not even -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to get processy.\xc2\xa0 But if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t the outreach that we saw in the past on trying to avert a government shutdown or increase the debt ceiling -- I mean, you have to read into that.\xc2\xa0 Why the change?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very candid and transparent about the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in promoting the American Jobs Act and trying to get Congress to act on it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Someone I think on the Republican side suggested yesterday or the day before that it\xe2\x80\x99s somehow a problem or wrong that the President is out there talking about the American Jobs Act with the American people as opposed to sitting in a room with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 His responsibility as President is to have these conversations with the American people, to take his message out and explain the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taking, and, in this case, and to urge Americans who believe, as he does, that Congress needs to act, that Washington needs to act, to take action to grow the economy and create jobs, to make their voices heard with their representatives, their senators and congressmen that they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent to Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But one does not preclude the other.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact of the matter is, we are now going to have the Senate vote on the President\xe2\x80\x99s jobs bill.\xc2\xa0 So something is working.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re taking will hopefully get the House to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it won\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 But it won\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 It likely won\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 So how is that anything more than setting up a political argument of Republicans are protecting the wealthy, which it seems the White House is doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, our goal, our highest priority, is to pass this bill and all the elements within it.\xc2\xa0 If we were to get only some of the bill, that would be a good thing; it would not be enough, and we would keep up the fight. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If, in the end, we get all of it, whether in whole or in part, by the end, if we get it all, that would be a victory for the American people.\xc2\xa0 We would be very satisfied with that if Congress took that action in that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that predictions about what Congress will do -- I think a couple days ago folks were predicting that the Senate wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to vote on it, and that looks not to have been a wise forecast.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how this plays out.\xc2\xa0 When it does get to the Senate, I think that every -- if 100 senators will not vote yes, then those who vote no will have to explain what is it they oppose, and why, and what priorities are they balancing if they\xe2\x80\x99re revenue increases on the wealthiest Americans to pay for legislation that would put teachers back to work and construction workers back to work and would give a tax cut to every working American, 150 million Americans, $1,500 next year for the average American family.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that because they don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- they think that the choice is not fair, that the most successful and affluent Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay more, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay their fair share, then they ought to say so. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if, then, we come to a point where we get pieces of the legislation, if your grim predictions prove true that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get the entire bill here at the White House to be signed in whole, then we will ask that question as each piece is passed and others are left behind, because we think that there is enormous widespread, bipartisan support out in the country for the provisions contained within the bill, and there is an enormous need here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard what people are saying about where our economy is right now.\xc2\xa0 We need to take action.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s really not an option to just sit on the sidelines and say, well, I hope it gets better.\xc2\xa0 Certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way that the American people feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we think Congress needs to take action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press for Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re gratified by the progress being made in the Senate, and we hope that we see the same kind of progress in the House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is okay with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we will meet -- we will discuss and meet with leaders, as well as take the -- take this discussion out among the American people, which we certainly think is a worthwhile thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is what with the 5 percent surcharge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that we put forward our proposal that we thought was the best way to pay for it, that alternatives --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But these are (inaudible) Senate Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, alternatives to pay for it were obviously available.\xc2\xa0 Remember that our provision for the pay-fors was designed so that we could submit to Congress specific legislation that if it passed in a vacuum would be paid for, and nothing else happened.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, within our legislation, it\xe2\x80\x99s linked to action by the super committee, and it would, if passed, would compel the super committee to extend or increase the amount of its savings in order to pay for this.\xc2\xa0 It was basically a trigger-off provision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if the super committee found alternative means to pay for the jobs bill that were different from our pay-fors, then it would trigger off, turn off the pay-fors we had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is important to us in the bill are the job-creating, economy-growing measures.\xc2\xa0 The pay-fors, as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re -- they meet the principles the President has set forward, are up to Congress to decide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And sorry to monopolize your time, but you said that Republicans would need to say why they don\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell has actually already told our Hill producer, Ted Barrett, that he would be against the surcharge because raising taxes during a recession is not a good idea.\xc2\xa0 Your response?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate; that the American people are making it very clear that they want action on the economy, they want action on jobs.\xc2\xa0 The American people are very clear that they feel that an appropriate way to pay for the necessary action on the economy and jobs is to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, and those who disagree obviously have to explain that to their constituents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get every Senator; it sounds like we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost one and I suppose we\xe2\x80\x99ll lose more.\xc2\xa0 But this President is focused on a proposition here that has broad support in the American public.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- again, what\xe2\x80\x99s the alternative?\xc2\xa0 Whatever you think of -- I mean, the jobs proposal that -- or so-called jobs proposal that has been put forward, for example, by the Republicans on the House side contains within it some provisions that this President fully supports and actually has acted on -- free trade agreements which, as you know, are moving through Congress as we speak; the patent reform bill which this President signed into law recently, and we expect and hope will unleash innovation in this country, which in turn will help create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what that -- those proposals don\xe2\x80\x99t do, separated from the free trade and patent reform, is address the immediate problem.\xc2\xa0 Even if you agree that everything in that proposal was the right thing to do -- and we certainly take issue with that -- but even if you did, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s seriously looked at it as an economist would suggest that it would have the kind of impact on our economic growth and employment in 2012 that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal has -- not even close.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the answer that those who oppose the American Jobs Act have for the problem that we have?\xc2\xa0 The President agrees that we have medium- and long-term issues that we need to address.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he put forward his sweeping proposal for significantly greater deficit reduction than is mandated by Congress to the super committee.\xc2\xa0 He agrees.\xc2\xa0 And he put forward a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 He also believes we have a short-term immediate problem that we need to act on now, and we need to do things that have an effect on the economy and that accelerate hiring now.\xc2\xa0 And what we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen yet are proposals from others in Congress that would do that -- alternative proposals.\xc2\xa0 So if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t available, let\xe2\x80\x99s vote on the jobs act, pass it, make it law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Tapper.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I assume you know that the quote she said about raising taxes during a recession is not a good idea is pretty much a word-for-word quote of something President Obama said in 2009.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I think the context is different.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitant to make comments on the specifics of the Senate pay-for proposal because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t examined it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, if low taxes on millionaires were the answer to economic growth, what exactly happened in 2007, 2008 and 2009?\xc2\xa0 Is that the answer?\xc2\xa0 Because we had our lowest tax rates on the wealthiest Americans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not the one that said it, the President is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and we experienced a catastrophic recession.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s changed his mind?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- this goes to what happens with the Senate provision, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just not familiar with it so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to address it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is about choices.\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that if it\xe2\x80\x99s a choice between millionaires whose successes are a blessing of being American and being part of this great country and the opportunities that it provides, should pay a little more to help this economy move forward, to put teachers back to work and construction workers back to work and give a tax cut to working Americans, then, yes, he thinks that tradeoff is sensible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually -- I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s actually more a question of timing, in some ways, because the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal raises taxes, but as he has pointed during his barnstorming tour, not until 2013, and the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 proposal actually would raise taxes, I believe, as of the first of the year.\xc2\xa0 So is the President going to stop saying that in his speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would have to look at the provision here.\xc2\xa0 I think that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you what it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY: I do trust you, Jake, but the problem is I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment if there were specifics that I\xe2\x80\x99m missing here, and -- but look, the broad point stands -- the second broad point also stands, that if we have to make choices here, that this trade-off is an acceptable one, whenever the revenue increases kick in, because of the urgent need we face to address an economic problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So since you had your briefing last, a couple bits of news have come out.\xc2\xa0 One is, the House Democrats released some emails about the Solyndra controversy, and specifically about the Department of Energy\xe2\x80\x99s vetting process.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, there are a lot of officials at the Department of the Office of Management and Budget who are concerned about the vetting process at the Department of Energy -- the word \xe2\x80\x9coblivious\xe2\x80\x9d was used.\xc2\xa0 Another OMB official said that -- I forget the exact language -- but implied that the Solyndra case is just the tip of the iceberg -- \xe2\x80\x9cBad days are ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the administration gone back to the Department of Energy to make sure that this vetting process for these taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 dollars -- billions in taxpayer dollars -- is as rigorous as is necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got a version of this question a few days ago and I can tell you that as this process has moved along, from the beginning -- and this is a program, as you know, that existed in the Bush administration before we took over; its funding increased through the Recovery Act but it was an existing program where loan applications, loan guarantee applications were reviewed by career experts, and that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were (inaudible) at Solyndra, though --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And that is -- well, no.\xc2\xa0 They sent back the application.\xc2\xa0 And the person who headed that office under President Bush, for a large part of President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s two terms in office, has said that he might have made the very same call on Solyndra.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no question -- I think you have to step back and say, look, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do a loan guarantee program, a loan guarantee program has within it a risk.\xc2\xa0 There is no guarantee -- the reason why you\xe2\x80\x99re backing up these loans is because there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee of success, but you believe, as a matter of policy, that these investments are worthwhile because you believe that the industries represented by these investments are essential to the economic future of the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Chinese certainly believe that, and they\xe2\x80\x99re investing billions and billions of dollars in clean energy technologies and it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the officials in OMB who are saying that the guys that manage the department aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing due diligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that there was -- there were differing opinions here.\xc2\xa0 What is also true is that -- and there is substantial data on this about all the people who thought that this was a bet, and -- but a worthwhile one, including all sorts of private investors who thought it was worthwhile, as well as assessments made by The Wall Street Journal and others about the potential for this company as an innovative company.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is obvious that not every investment is going to succeed, and we are disappointed that this one didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But the overall program continues to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And what we refuse to buy into is the defeatist attitude that was expressed just the other day -- yesterday, I think, maybe the day before -- by the Chairman of the Energy Committee in the House who said, we can\xe2\x80\x99t compete; the United States cannot compete with China in the solar energy field or the wind turbine field. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xc2\xa0 For the next -- I mean, in these vital industries we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to be buying our technology and our products from China?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that the American people want to hear from Washington.\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99re the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 These are vital industries.\xc2\xa0 We should be investing in them, helping them grow so that they can create jobs here and they can enhance our energy independence. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, if we\xe2\x80\x99re reliant on foreign countries for the technology for renewable energy, we\xe2\x80\x99re only -- then we just become reliable -- even as our reliance on oil decreases, we rely on imports for other forms of energy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not sensible national security policy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not sensible economic policy.\xc2\xa0 So we remain --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the vetting any more rigorous?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s really just<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 But the -- and I think I addressed it, and I addressed it in the past -- it has been evaluated and adjustments have been made -- not in the last few weeks or months because of these stories -- but all along, from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.\xc2\xa0 And for more specifics I would refer you to the Department of Energy.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to just step back and look at why this program is worthwhile, why folks in the previous administration thought it was worthwhile, why people who understand the vital importance of the clean energy industry, in general, to the 21st century, believe it\xe2\x80\x99s worthwhile.\xc2\xa0 And the President remains committed to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been calls for a general counsel to investigate whether or not the Attorney General perjured himself when testifying about Fast and Furious.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there has been one call -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a biannual call for a special counsel by this particular congressman.\xc2\xa0 Once every six months we hear something similar.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to both the House and the Senate was consistent and truthful. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said in both March and May of this year that he became aware of the questionable tactics employed in the Fast and Furious operation in early 2011, when ATF agents first raised them publicly.\xc2\xa0 And he then asked the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s Office to investigate the matter, demonstrating how seriously he took them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question in May was when did he first hear about Fast and Furious?\xc2\xa0 Not the questionable tactics, but when did he first hear of the program?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was consistent and truthful.\xc2\xa0 And calls for special counsels, which seem to be a regular occurrence, do not change that fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when the Attorney General learned about the questionable tactics, he asked the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s Office to investigate the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Solyndra for just a second before we get back to the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure -- urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- urgent need to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 The question was never whether you were going to lose money on venture capital.\xc2\xa0 Of course you can.\xc2\xa0 The question was whether this particular program was properly vetted and whether the technology itself was vetted properly in addition to the financial arrangements.\xc2\xa0 I mean -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- that is a question.\xc2\xa0 One question has been about was the -- was there undue, inappropriate influence.\xc2\xa0 And there is no evidence to suggest there was because -- precisely because career experts at the Department of Energy were evaluating these loan applications and recommended that we move forward on Solyndra.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that people knew that, as you would expect --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the people at OMB raised questions about this, as you very well know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, and the experts -- rather than here at the White House, the experts at the Department of Energy made that judgment.\xc2\xa0 But to say that every -- if these things were absolutely, patently obvious and clear, and 100 percent everybody agreed, then they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in an industry that requires the kind of investments that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 The reason why you have these loan guarantee programs is because you need to help seed these industries so that they then can grow and attract private capital, which you understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but there are also questions raised about the kind -- the particular kind of solar technology --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, actually, the questions were raised -- this has to do with Chinese actions on the pricing of solar panels and subsidies and that kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 The technology itself, as I understand it, was widely celebrated within the community --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were questions raised about the particular kind of technology Solyndra was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyway --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a process that was evaluated by -- over at the Department of Energy.\xc2\xa0 And for more details on that, you can -- I refer you to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re aggressively pursuing the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean apart from the President going out every couple of days and saying \xe2\x80\x9cpass this bill\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an extraordinary amount of contempt expressed here and apparently on Capitol Hill for the idea that the President of the United States should actually go out and meet and talk with the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not expressing contempt for that at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I find that rather surprising because --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if that\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, he\xe2\x80\x99s spending a lot of time focusing on this, as he should be, because it is the number-one priority of this administration, this President, and this American public.\xc2\xa0 And he is engaging -- it\xe2\x80\x99s another way of asking what kind of conversations is he having with members of Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s having those conversations, and he will continue to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 His senior team here will continue to have those conversations, and eventually I\xe2\x80\x99m sure negotiations as we move forward.\xc2\xa0 But I simply reject the idea that there is not a compelling reason for him to go out and talk about this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- in Texas, or Ohio.\xc2\xa0 In Kentucky or Virginia.\xc2\xa0 All over the country -- Seattle, California.\xc2\xa0 This is the urgent priority the American people have made clear they have, so I think Presidents deserve to hear from -- rather, the American people deserve to hear from their President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senate Democrats were not going to vote on this bill until they\xe2\x80\x99re ready, which is sometime next week.\xc2\xa0 Durbin himself said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Bill.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the Senate, as you know, today announced that it\xe2\x80\x99s moving forward and will have a vote on this legislation.\xc2\xa0 I am confident --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t say when.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and the President believes he\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent Attorney General and has great confidence in him, and we absolutely know that the testimony he gave was consistent and truthful.\xc2\xa0 And --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how does he have confidence in him if he\xe2\x80\x99s a year off on what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If a piece of paper in a document that\xe2\x80\x99s many, many pages long contained a phrase that discussed nothing about the tactics that are at issue here, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about -- I just want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 In his quote he never said tactics.\xc2\xa0 He said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as he said in public, in a press conference, he heard about it when he read about it.\xc2\xa0 And that was sometime earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 I think the press conference was in El Salvador when he was on that trip, and he referenced having heard about it recently.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Sheryl Atkinson of CBS News is saying that a few days ago, I believe, a White House official and a Justice Department official was yelling and screaming at her -- she\xe2\x80\x99s been reporting about this for some time -- about this whole story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were a reporter once.\xc2\xa0 When government officials start yelling at you, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99re getting defensive, right?\xc2\xa0 Why would they be yelling at her?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I have no insight into the conversations she may or may not have had.\xc2\xa0 Second of all, I know that you guys are all hard-bitten, veteran journalists and probably don\xe2\x80\x99t complain when you have tough conversations with your sources sometimes.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is just generally speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she\xe2\x80\x99s a credible reporter.\xc2\xa0 When you say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what conversations she had,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, she said this on the record that she was yelled at and screamed at.\xc2\xa0 Why would the administration be yelling at her about this story?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I take issue with the report.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- what I think is that I know you are tough enough to handle an extra decibel or two in a phone conversation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that happened here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a surprising complaint.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 There were some riots in Greece today, and Mayor Bloomberg recently suggested that because of high unemployment there could be riots in the streets of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And right now we don\xe2\x80\x99t have riots but there\xe2\x80\x99s the Occupy Wall Street movement that\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House view about Occupy Wall Street, and what do you think about the riots in Greece and whether or not something like that could happen here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave aside the comparison to Greece.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that there are Americans out there who are understandably frustrated with the economy, with their difficulty in finding a job or holding onto a job.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is exactly why the President is -- despite Bill\xe2\x80\x99s contempt -- barnstorming around the country arguing for the urgent need for Congress to act on the American Jobs Act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that there\xe2\x80\x99s frustration.\xc2\xa0 And need I remind you that this President fought -- and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always pretty -- to make sure that we passed sweeping consumer protections in the Financial Reform Act that was opposed by Congress, and that which members -- I mean, Congress, by Republicans in Congress -- Republicans now who want to repeal it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in part because millions and millions of dollars are being spent to lobby against it by the industries who don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xc2\xa0 But the -- look, we got into an awful mess because of in part some of the actions that were taken by Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 And two things are true about the actions this President took in the wake of that, when he took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression -- a catastrophic contraction in the economy, catastrophic job loss. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One, he had to ensure that we stopped the bleeding and we prevented a depression.\xc2\xa0 He also wanted to make sure that we -- he believes very strongly in capitalism and the absolute need for the United States of America to have a vibrant, strong financial sector.\xc2\xa0 And he took actions that weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily popular to make sure that that remained the case -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s got the scars to prove it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also believes that that industry needs to be held to account, and that we need to take actions to ensure that the kind of things -- the kinds of things, the kinds of actions and behaviors that helped cause this incredible crisis can\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he fought to pass the Financial Reform Act.\xc2\xa0 And it provides protections to consumers that are vital, and lays out some rules of the road that Wall Street should follow, and that, again, the vast majority of Americans agree with him on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, over the last couple of days, a plot to assassinate Hamid Karzai was apparently foiled.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Rabbani, the designated peacemaker, was assassinated about two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai has suspended talks with elements of the Taliban who may or may not have been willing to lay down their arms.\xc2\xa0 And now the Pew Research Center has a poll out this morning saying one in three American veterans -- post-9/11 veterans say the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going on and all the corners that have been turned in Afghanistan only to lead to wide alleys, what does the President say to those veterans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Because their country asked them to do heroic, extraordinary things.\xc2\xa0 And for the veterans who came back, we honor their service every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This President\xe2\x80\x99s position on Iraq, which was the principle preoccupation of the previous administration in terms of these wars, was clear during the campaign, and his promises are being kept.\xc2\xa0 He is ending that war, has ended it.\xc2\xa0 And we are on track to remove all troops from Iraq by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And we are doing it -- we\xe2\x80\x99re ending that war in a responsible way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, he made clear during the campaign that partly because of the preoccupation and focus on Iraq, the effort in Afghanistan was neglected.\xc2\xa0 He has kept his promise to refocus our attention on Afghanistan and to make clear that our objective and primary goal there is to defeat al Qaeda, the enemy that attacked us on September 11, 2001.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is meeting those objectives and he is keeping those promises.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the drawdown from the surge forces is underway.\xc2\xa0 It will be complete.\xc2\xa0 And then we will -- by next year, next summer, I believe -- and then we will continue to draw down forces to the point where we turn over security lead to the Afghans by the end of 2014.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are hard fights, and the sacrifice is immense and tremendous.\xc2\xa0 And, again, to go back to the beginning, he is extraordinarily grateful -- we all are, and everyone I believe here -- for their sacrifice and service.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A final question.\xc2\xa0 When you -- when the President unveiled his stimulus/not a stimulus, the $450 billion jobs plan, the Buffett rule was only a principle.\xc2\xa0 Now Senate leaders have gone further than simply a principle and probably further than the principle that was enunciated, as I understood it, anyway, to make sure that millionaires pay their fair tax -- Warren Buffett pays the same rate as his secretary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has been criticized in the past over the course of his administration for ceding leadership to Congress and elsewhere on health care and ending up with sort of half a loaf.\xc2\xa0 Core Democratic supporters even say that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think so.\xc2\xa0 Let me stop you there.\xc2\xa0 I think achieving health care reform --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he ceding leadership again on this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- after 100 years of effort, ensuring that 30 million Americans get ensured, ensuring that people with preexisting conditions get insurance coverage, ensuring that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen, millions of young Americans get to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more than half a loaf.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President misread Congress on the pay-fors in this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back, Mike, to what I said.\xc2\xa0 The pay-fors are incidental, if you will.\xc2\xa0 The meat of this legislation, the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, is, are the provisions that put teachers back to work, put construction workers to work, that cut taxes for working Americans, incentivize small business to grow and hire and increase their wages.\xc2\xa0 And that will be voted on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How you pay for it we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said was something we were hoping to negotiate and debate as long as it meets the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles.\xc2\xa0 And the Senate is taking action accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know -- and we had this discussion as we were trying to explain the complexity of it -- when we put forward the American Jobs Act with the pay-fors in it, we explained that they were isolated portions of what the President would put forward in his very broad deficit reduction plan, the revenue increases from that, that we were attaching to this provision to make is a standalone piece of legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was -- within it was always the possibility, because of the link with the super committee, that if other means were found to pay for it through the super committee, the pay-fors that we put in the bill would be turned off and not used.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that makes clear that from the beginning we were focused on the job-creating and economy-growing provisions, and not the specific means to pay for it, as long as those means meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other day the President said that he was opposed to the Bank of America new debit fee, and that this was -- the government should do something to stop it.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the administration --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he said that.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- two points about that.\xc2\xa0 One, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that the consumer protections -- the financial reform that passed contains within it no compulsion, no provision that compels banks to do this -- quite the opposite.\xc2\xa0 It protects consumers from hidden fees.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other point is, obviously, that banks have to decide how they adjust to the provisions within that act, and consumers have to decide what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do in reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s how the system works.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the legislation that was passed -- financial reform -- that compels banks to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So is it -- is this fee a legitimate fee, albeit one that consumers may want to take into account when choosing their bank?\xc2\xa0 Is this a legitimate fee that the government has no particular cause to try and stop?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the companies -- the banks, in this case -- to decide what approach they want to take, and I think that then consumers to judge accordingly.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is not -- what the provision with regard to the bank swipe -- I mean, to the card swipe fee that is in the legislation has to do with insuring that small enterprises are able to -- are not gouged by the companies, the credit card companies, and therefore so that they are able to accept debit cards from consumers and customers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How the banks decide to deal with the overall legislation is up to them.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of compulsion that the government might engage in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his interview with ABC, he said, regarding the debit fees, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can stop it,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning the government could stop these fees -- and, presumably, he favored they would.\xc2\xa0 And he also said that the government can tell the banks, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have some inherent right to just, you know, get a certain amount of profit if your customers are being mistreated.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does Bank of America have the inherent right to get the profit it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get from this $5 fee or no?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the point is, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s not an inherent right.\xc2\xa0 If they make decisions, they make decisions.\xc2\xa0 And customers, the market reacts accordingly.\xc2\xa0 We can -- he can, or anybody can, express an opinion that they think it\xe2\x80\x99s excessive or unfair, and some have done that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do this.\xc2\xa0 And other -- different institutions will take different actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s no plans, and the President has not directed any way for any agency of the government to try to stop or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this fee.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to paying for the job creation bill, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You said the Senate Democrats have put out an idea that we think will work.\xc2\xa0 Have you now concluded that this is the best way to pay for this thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we put forward what we thought was the best or a good way to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 Again, going back -- and I won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat them -- all my comments about the relative --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ensuring it is balanced and fair, or fair and balanced, you might say, in its pay-fors is -- those are his principles, as regards how you pay for the legislation, which would put Americans back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99re agnostic as to when the pay-fors would kick in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitant to engage in a discussion about the Senate proposed pay-for when I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the details of when it would kick in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just that on the campaign trail since he\xe2\x80\x99s been going around the country he says nobody is talking about raising taxes right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of his selling points.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again -- well, I know, because you were sitting there, that you heard the discussion I just had.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with, in enough detail, to comment on that difference.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the overall approach is one that we feel meets the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as part of economic policy it seems important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And as a matter of tradeoffs, we think those tradeoffs are worthwhile.\xc2\xa0 But, again, without addressing when it would take effect, because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the information, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take that question tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems like as a matter of economic policy whether you think there should be tax hikes now or later is kind of important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the President said what he said.\xc2\xa0 Again, I will address the issue of the Senate provision when I have more information about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question about this.\xc2\xa0 I know that in the weeks past you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked various versions of this, but the package itself, as you point out over and over again, is very popular.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the pay-fors that are controversial.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The pay-fors are very popular, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it seems like the pay-fors are opposed by enough Democrats that it\xe2\x80\x99s allowed Republicans to point out the difference between the President and his own Democrats on this issue.\xc2\xa0 So I guess my question is, why not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- and, again, this is hypothetical -- the fact that 100 percent of Republicans in the Senate presumably, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, oppose something that the vast majority of the American people support, and 90 to 95 or 98 percent of Democrats support what the American people support, I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, whatever --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a -- well, the reality of the way that the Senate has been functioning is that you need 60 votes, which is why -- not a majority, but 60, for anything; naming a post office, practically -- we are going to work hard to try to convince Republican senators about the wisdom of putting teachers back to work in their states, construction workers back to work in their states, giving an expanded payroll tax cut to the citizens of their state.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the reality of this system in the Senate is that what you need exceeds even 100 percent "yes" votes from the Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But we are confident that the overwhelming majority of Democrats support this provision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just one -- just one question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, seriously, you were talking about how the Republicans insisted on putting their -- the House Republicans had their deficit plan that could -- the President had threatened a veto; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to become law -- why do it?\xc2\xa0 Do you still -- even with that history, do you want the House Republicans to vote on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan, even though Eric Cantor says, I know my guys are not going to vote for it; it won\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t want Harry Reid to hold a vote on the whole package, even though, when the appointed hour comes, he may well not have enough to get past a filibuster?\xc2\xa0 You want that to go ahead?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do, Mark.\xc2\xa0 And we were engaged in obvious negotiations.\xc2\xa0 There were provisions that -- the absolute important difference is that the things that you were talking about that were being voted on in the House, that had no chance of clearing Congress, let alone being signed into law by the President, were overwhelmingly unpopular, unsupported by the American people.\xc2\xa0 Voucherizing Medicare -- check your data -- not popular.\xc2\xa0 The kind of approach that was represented in the House Republican budget -- not -- this was not something that had the American people\xe2\x80\x99s support. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we know about the American Jobs Act and the provisions within it is not only does it have the support of the American people, every provision in it has been supported -- or similar provisions to it -- the kinds of provisions that are in the American Jobs Act have been supported overwhelmingly by Republicans in the past, including Mitch McConnell. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a big -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge difference.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge difference when you talk about the admittedly difficult task, but possible task, of convincing members of Congress to actually vote with the people they represent, to vote in line with how they voted in the past.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that distinction is pretty significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a symbolic vote is okay --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it has to be symbolic.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we need to take urgent action on the economy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are saying.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a groundswell of the American people saying, you know what?\xc2\xa0 What we need right now is to dismantle Medicare, charge seniors $6,000 more per year, and that will answer all our problems.\xc2\xa0 I can guarantee you that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what we were hearing from the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carrie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay -- Jay, I was next.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well -- but is that those cuts, with regard to defense spending, are significant and not ones that we think are the right way to go, which is just another reason for the super committee to avoid that outcome and take action that represents a balanced approach to deficit and debt reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is that possibility of a figure that\xe2\x80\x99s lower than the $600 billion that could -- just the Pentagon could take --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into drawing lines about what dollar figure is acceptable.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward his proposals and contained -- and those proposals contain within them reductions in spending, as well as cuts in entitlement costs and revenue increases.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach to take, and that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do anything dramatic to entitlements, to defense, certainly to non-defense discretionary if you approach this in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 You can achieve significant long-term deficit and debt reduction on the order of the $3 trillion he put forward, in addition to the $1 trillion already agreed upon, if you do it in a balanced way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put the burden unduly on any sector of the government and its responsibilities, including national security, or on any segment of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just have one follow-up question on the -- or I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the $1 million threshold that you were talking about.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Democrats -- talking about the surtax, the President in his principle seems to start at $1 million or above millionaires.\xc2\xa0 Why is -- is there an attempt to back away from the $250,000 level?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any kind of now protected status for people under $1 million?\xc2\xa0 Has it changed at all, or is this just something --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This President supports the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for the highest-income earners, those making more than $250,000.\xc2\xa0 That has not changed.\xc2\xa0 Full stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also supports tax reform that would as a guiding principle contain within it the Buffett rule, and those things coexist happily, as does the Senate approach to this.\xc2\xa0 One does not cancel out the other.\xc2\xa0 But, again, the Buffett rule -- or Buffett principle is an approach that he believes should guide Congress as it deals with the complex issues of tax reform.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go to April.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a groundswell on the issue of voter suppression.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House and the Justice Department doing to look into issues of voter suppression to include the voter ID issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of things are handled by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we obviously believe that the right to vote is a fundamental right of every American citizen that should be honored and upheld and certainly not suppressed.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about what Justice might be doing to look into those issues, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a vital principle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know it was -- I know early on the White House said it was basically a state issue.\xc2\xa0 But because it\xe2\x80\x99s become more of an issue, has the White House called, worked with Justice on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 Again, Justice would be working on it if there was actions of any kind, so I would refer you there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask you one more question.\xc2\xa0 As you are actively involved in campaigning now, 13 months out -- the administration, President, to include the campaign has said this is going to be a hard-fought election.\xc2\xa0 Has there been attacks on this President or the presidency in regards to issues of race?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s both?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s just one?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Honestly, April, we\xe2\x80\x99re just not focused on that, not because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question that you might ask, but because this President firmly believes that Americans out there have serious challenges and problems that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been hired to lead the country and to address these challenges, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not worried about himself at all.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s worried about a recovery that\xe2\x80\x99s not moving quick enough, unemployment that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 And he feels like if he puts forward ideas and articulates them well and convinces Congress to take them up and pass them, and that, in turn, results in some much needed help for the American people, some much needed help for this economy, and for those who are looking for work, that that -- that would be a big success, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, campaigning is one thing.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going to engage in the campaign, and he\xe2\x80\x99s -- and he has campaign events.\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, I just know, from spending so much time with him, this is not about him.\xc2\xa0 It is not at all about him.\xc2\xa0 It is about the reason he got in to begin with, which was he saw leadership in Washington that had sort of taken its eye off the ball, both on our domestic issues and our national security issues; that we were -- that the middle class was falling behind; that in a decade where the wealthiest Americans had seen their incomes and their share of the country\xe2\x80\x99s wealth expand dramatically, the middle class had been running in place or falling behind.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what he really is focused on.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t spend any time talking about the kinds of issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait a minute, what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing -- and many people have remarked we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen attacks on this President that we have not seen with other presidents before.\xc2\xa0 And this is a question -- if you attack him with his race, is that an attack on the presidency?\xc2\xa0 Because he is the President of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of thing we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 Politics is -- can be a rough-and-tumble business, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a business that, at its best, is engaged in doing right by the American people.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:55 P.M.
