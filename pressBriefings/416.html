Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>**Please see below for a correction to the transcript, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>1:21 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 Let me just do a quick announcement at the top, Jim, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, September 16th -- that\xe2\x80\x99s next Tuesday -- the President will travel to Atlanta, Georgia, where he will visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to receive a breaking -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, let\xe2\x80\x99s start over again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will travel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to receive a briefing on the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, discuss the U.S. response to that outbreak, and thank the scientists, doctors and health care workers who are helping those affected by the disease at home and around the world.\xc2\xa0 The President will also receive an update on the respiratory illness that\xe2\x80\x99s been reported in several states across the Midwest.</p>\n<p>That evening, the President will travel to Tampa, Florida, where he will remain overnight.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will visit U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.\xc2\xa0 As many of you know, Central Command\xe2\x80\x99s area of responsibility includes 20 countries in the Middle East and Central and South Asia, including Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 As we implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, it\xe2\x80\x99s the men and women of CENTCOM who will partner with others in the region to carry out our limited military mission in those countries.\xc2\xa0 While at CENTCOM, the President will receive a briefing from his top commanders there, and thank the servicemembers for their continued hard work on these efforts.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some additional logistical details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip over the weekend and then again on Monday.\xc2\xa0 So should be an interesting trip of the President at the beginning of the next week.</p>\n<p>Jim, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Turkey didn\xe2\x80\x99t sign on to the communiqu\xc3\xa9 in Saudi Arabia expressing support for confronting Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 There have been concerns also about whether Kuwait and Qatar are doing enough to prevent fundraising for extremist groups.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the White House satisfied with the level of commitment that it\xe2\x80\x99s getting from certain allies in the Middle East in dealing with and confronting Islamic State?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that you mentioned the communiqu\xc3\xa9, because I do think that there are a couple of important things about it.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that the communiqu\xc3\xa9 was signed by ministers representing states of the Gulf Coast Cooperation Council -- or the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and, of course, the United States.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of this communiqu\xc3\xa9, each of those organizations and countries declares \xe2\x80\x9ctheir shared commitment to stand united against the threat posed by all terrorism, including the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, to the region and the world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Over the course of the communiqu\xc3\xa9, they lay out their commitment to \xe2\x80\x9cdo their share in the comprehensive fight against ISIL, including\xe2\x80\x9d -- and then they list several things, and it ends with \xe2\x80\x9cas appropriate, joining in the many aspects of the coordinated military campaign against ISIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That is an early indication of the interest that the United States is seeing from our partners in the region in presenting a united front to the terrorists in ISIL.\xc2\xa0 There is a strong commitment from these countries in the region to working with the international community to deny ISIL the kind of safe haven that would pose a significant threat to countries in the region, but also countries around the world.</p>\n<p>This will continue to be an ongoing effort to build support to identify needs and to identify the specific capabilities of countries where they could meet the needs of the broader coalition.</p>\n<p>So this is difficult work, but the President, as he indicated in his news conference at the NATO Summit at the end of last week, has been pleased with the reception that we have gotten from our partners and allies around the world as it relates to their willingness to engage in the efforts of this international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But any disappointment that particularly Turkey, a NATO member, would not sign on to something like this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you mentioned, each country has their own specific set of interests that are related to this specific situation.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt -- and we have seen this both in private comments from Turkish officials, but also in public comments from Turkish officials -- that they are concerned, and rightly so, about the instability and violence that has been created by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously all occurring right on the doorstep of Turkey, and they are rightly concerned.</p>\n<p>I understand that the Secretary of State is actually there today, I believe, to meet with Turkish officials and his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 The President had the opportunity to visit with President Erdogan at the NATO Summit last week.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, was in Turkey at the beginning of this week.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the thorough consultation that is underway between the United States and Turkey to discuss with them what role they can play and how they can contribute to this broader international coalition.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcome the partnership and alliance that we have with Turkey, and look forward to their efforts to join with the international community to meet this threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you mentioned that one way that Congress could support the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in Iraq and Syria, and while you said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary, it could be by providing authority on a revised use-of-force agreement.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to send Congress a revised authorization for use of force that Congress could act on to provide that kind of support, even though you feel it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, we have not.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plan to do so at this point.\xc2\xa0 As you pointed out, it is the view of this administration, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team specifically, that additional authorization from Congress is not required; that he has the authority that he needs to order the military actions that he has to degrade and ultimate destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That will be done in coordination with a broader international coalition.\xc2\xa0 It will not include U.S. troops being placed into ground combat in Iraq or Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That all said, the President would welcome support from Congress for this strategy.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of ways that Congress could indicate this support and the President believes that this support -- or this indication of support -- would be beneficial because it would demonstrate to our allies and to our enemies that the United States stands united in pursuit of the strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, on immigration.\xc2\xa0 The Associated Press is reporting that there has been a marked decline in deportations and the pace is fewer than it has been since 2007.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s a deliberate effort by the White House or the administration to cut back on deportations, given the criticism that the President has received from the immigration community.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Deportations are an enforcement action, and those enforcement actions are made by law enforcement officials at the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 So this is not something that is mandated by the White House.\xc2\xa0 These are enforcement decisions that are carried out by law enforcement officials at the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>However, I do think that these numbers do reflect something that the President has talked about a little bit, which is that as we confronted a situation at the border earlier this summer -- a situation that has abated -- but at one point earlier this summer, there was concern about having the needed resources to deal with a surge that we had seen along the southwest border as it relates to children who are attempting to enter the country who were not traveling with an adult.\xc2\xa0 And the President did indicate that we, as an administration, would shift resources from the interior of the country to the border to supplement our efforts to secure the border and to process the cases of those who had been apprehended at the border attempting to gain entry into the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The shifting of those resources may have something to do with those numbers, but that is not -- but, again, those numbers reflect the enforcement activities of law enforcement officials at the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0 It seems that lawmakers are expected to extend the charter for nine more months, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the White House has concerns about the brevity of that extension.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, the thing that we have indicated is that it was incredibly important for Congress to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0 The Bank plays a key role in creating jobs and stimulating economic growth.\xc2\xa0 There are many businesses large and small all across the country that benefit from the activities of the Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- support for the Ex-Im Bank has traditionally been a bipartisan proposition.\xc2\xa0 In the past, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read quotes from people like President Reagan himself who signed legislation to reauthorize the bank.\xc2\xa0 At the time, President Reagan articulated the variety of reasons why the Ex-Im Bank was beneficial for the American economy and important to American job creation.\xc2\xa0 That is also why organizations like the Chamber of Commerce that don\xe2\x80\x99t often agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies do in this case support the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Ex-Im Bank should be reauthorized.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you concerned about the brevity that Congress has -- are you concerned, though, about the brevity of the proposed extension?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- reauthorizing the bank is the responsibility of the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there have been efforts underway to pass legislation to reauthorize it.</p>\n<p>It is the view of the administration that the bank should be reauthorized because of the important role it plays in stimulating economic growth and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the length of time over which -- for which the bank is reauthorized, we have not taken a position on that.\xc2\xa0 Our view is just that the Export-Import Bank does work that\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American economy and for American job creation, and it should continue to do that work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Russian sanctions announced today, how concerned is the White House about the financial impact these sanctions will have on U.S. energy companies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, when it comes to sanctions, what the United States is focused on is acting in coordination with our allies, particularly our allies in Europe.\xc2\xa0 The impact of these sanctions is always implemented in a way to maximize the impact on the Russian economy, to minimize the impact on the American economy, and ensure -- or at least do our best to make sure -- that American businesses are not put at a significant disadvantage vis-\xc3\xa0-vis their competitors in other countries that are not working closely with the United States on a sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>So there is an element of coordination here that does play a role in the decisions that are made about sanctions regimes that are put in place.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the sanctions regime that has been put in place, again, in concert with our European allies, will focus the impact on the Russian economy, will reduce the exposure that American businesses have to businesses that may try to game the system in a way that would give them an unfair advantage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we are certain at -- or we are confident that this new round of sanctions will have economic costs for Russia.\xc2\xa0 And they are indicative of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s resolve to standing up for the territorial integrity of the people of Ukraine, and ensuring that all countries -- including Russia -- abide by generally accepted international norms that relate to the sovereignty of independent nations.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the CR.\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about adding to the CR, but it strikes me that since Republicans rolled it out earlier this week, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from you guys whether you would sign the CR as presented by the Republicans -- the House Republicans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Justin, the administration has been consulting with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill about the continuing resolution.\xc2\xa0 There are certain aspects of the continuing resolution that are important.\xc2\xa0 We have indicated that we believe that the best way for Congress to act on the Title 10 authority to train Syrian opposition fighters is for Congress to add that authority to the continuing resolution.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with Congress.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a statement of the administration position on the continuing resolution at this point, but it is part of the ongoing consultation that we are having with members of Congress in both parties.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President sign something that overfunds his defense ask?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like a tactic that House Republicans seem to be using so that they would have more leverage in the December round of budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So if a CR is sent to the White House that overfunds the defense ask, is that something that you guys would consider signing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position at this point, Justin, to confirm which aspects of the CR are aspects that we support, and which are deal-breakers or which aspects --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any deal-breakers when it comes to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- of their proposals that they can live with.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not here at this point to issue a veto threat of any kind.\xc2\xa0 I can confirm for you that there are some things that we care about being included in the CR -- Title 10 authority is one of them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to ensure that whatever continuing resolution is passed by the Congress is something that the President can sign.</p>\n<p>Of course, the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re having this conversation is because the President does believe that we should risk the traction that our economy has gained by shutting down the government.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we can work through any differences of opinion and hopefully end up in a place where Congress can quickly pass a continuing resolution that includes Title 10 authority so that the President can pursue the national security priority that he discussed in his speech on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just finally on the CR.\xc2\xa0 I know that you had expressed some skepticism, and certainly some Democrats raising some money had expressed some skepticism that Republicans would pass a CR and prevent a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- I know you guys have been talking to the Hill -- if you right now believe that Congress will pass a CR before the end of the month.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would hesitate to make predictions about the future, particularly when it relates to issues like this.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that the kinds of conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having with members of Congress over the course of this week about the continuing resolution have been constructive.\xc2\xa0 And that is encouraging.\xc2\xa0 I think both sides acknowledge that a government shutdown would have a very negative impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And based on the constructive conversations we\xe2\x80\x99ve had so far, we believe that we should be able to get this done in a timely fashion.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would fall in line with the national security priority that the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One is on the Arab states.\xc2\xa0 They said that they would be prepared to do their share, and they talk about \xe2\x80\x9cas appropriate, joining in many aspects.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But this language is a little amorphous.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get your hands around it.\xc2\xa0 What are they actually saying that they would do, besides Saudi Arabia hosting the Syrian rebels for training?\xc2\xa0 Will they provide troops, for example?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Victoria, each of these individual nations has their own calculation about what they\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to provide.\xc2\xa0 And when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to make announcements about what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to announce it from here; we\xe2\x80\x99ll allow these other countries to make their own announcements about their contribution to this international effort.</p>\n<p>We are pleased by the initial reaction we\xe2\x80\x99ve received from governments in the region and from our allies around the world as it relates to their willingness to participate in a robust fashion in this broad international coalition that the United States is leading.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this will be an ongoing effort by the United States to cultivate this broader international coalition.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the first round of conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had have been positive, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage deeply with these nations as we determine what sort of contributions make the most sense for the success of the international coalition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the other piece of this that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand -- that we want to make sure that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t just making commitments in a way that isn\xe2\x80\x99t carefully integrated with the commitments that are made by other members of the coalition; that as we can sort of draw up a list of needs, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified them, and then go out and seek commitments from specific countries based on their expertise or their capability to fill those needs, that will be a way for us to coordinate and integrate this international coalition in a way that will make it efficient and successful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the CIA is reporting that they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a surge in recruitment for ISIS, up to maybe 31,000 fighters now.\xc2\xa0 Do you think you have sufficient Syrian rebel fighters to train to take them on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Victoria, the intelligence community has assessed that ISIL can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s based on a new review of all-source intelligence reports.</p>\n<p>They have indicated that the increase in ISIL fighters is an indication that the group has had some recruitment success after the battlefield successes that they demonstrated back in June.\xc2\xa0 And it reflects some better insight that the intelligence community has been able to gain into the activities of ISIL.</p>\n<p>We are confident that the strategy that the President has put forward and discussed in his primetime address on Wednesday night is sufficient to meet the threat that is posed by ISIL, even given the assessment that they may be able to muster a slightly larger force than was previously believed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think you can get enough Syrian rebels who are trainable to take them on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Victoria, there are a large number of components of this strategy, and we are confident that this comprehensive strategy that includes diplomatic intelligence and, yes, military components, is the right one to succeed in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around. Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just going back to a conversation we had earlier this week about immigration.\xc2\xa0 I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s dropped a little bit off the front burner this week, but the President was supposed to announce his decision on the executive actions at the end of the summer, which is about eight or nine days away from now.\xc2\xa0 But now he has delayed the announcement.\xc2\xa0 But has the President made the decision about what he wants to do after the election?\xc2\xa0 Has he made a decision and is just not telling people because of the politically charged climate?\xc2\xa0 Or has he -- or for some reason -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve offered a reason why he is not announcing it now, but why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he made a decision yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Zeke, the President was asked this question in the interview that he did over the weekend with Chuck on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And what he indicated is that he was still waiting to cross some t\xe2\x80\x99s as it relates to the implementation of that strategy.\xc2\xa0 So I think you can conclude from that comment that the President is determined to take executive action within the confines of the law before the end of the year to address and reform as many aspects of the broken immigration system as he can using his own executive authority.</p>\n<p>But there is still a little work to be done as it relates to implementing that strategy.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that all of the needed decisions have been made, but there have been a number of consultations between the President and members of his team, principally the Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, who has been responsible for leading this review alongside the Attorney General of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So there have been many conversations.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0 There are still some additional decisions that need to be finalized, but what that indicates is that while there is a little bit more work to be done, most of the work has been completed and we are positioned to make an announcement about these decisions before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All that work was supposed to have been done within 10 days from now.\xc2\xa0 So is that still on pace?\xc2\xa0 Will the President have all -- with those t\xe2\x80\x99s be crossed and the i\xe2\x80\x99s dotted by the end of summer?\xc2\xa0 And then the President will just hold it on his desk or in a shelf somewhere, waiting until after the election to announce it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am not under the impression that this will all be finalized next week.\xc2\xa0 I am under the impression that it will take some time to finalize some of these decisions but, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position where the vast majority of the work has been done.\xc2\xa0 This is something that Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder have been at work on for a couple of months now.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve had their teams working hard at this.\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of conversations between senior White House officials and those teams.\xc2\xa0 The President has had a number of conversations about these recommendations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So a lot of the work here, the bulk of the work, you could even say, has been done.\xc2\xa0 There does remain a little bit more to do but that work will be completed in sufficient time for the President to make a decision and announce it before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick add.\xc2\xa0 I know Denis McDonough was on the Hill yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He had a rough reception at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how the meeting was described to me, but go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how would you characterize the response to the President\xe2\x80\x99s delay after saying at the end of summer, now after the election, from immigration reform activists?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve put out statements that have been fairly critical.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment of that community\xe2\x80\x99s response?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think they can speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 I can speak for the President.\xc2\xa0 In terms of our -- why don\xe2\x80\x99t I try to assess our relationship with them if maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s an easier way for me to answer your question.</p>\n<p>As reflected by the decision of the White House Chief of Staff to travel to Capitol Hill to sit down with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, there continues to be a strong commitment by the White House to working closely with members of Congress who have, like the President, made immigration reform a top priority.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely and consult closely with members of Congress who share this objective, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Yes, there are members of Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as they have made known publicly, who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the strategy that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that is not going to prevent the administration from continuing to work with them to accomplish the goal that we share.\xc2\xa0 It also -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 The readout that I got from that meeting is that many of them were heartened by the fact that the Chief of Staff was able to reiterate to them in person that the President would make a decision, the President had decided to act, that his determination to act using his executive authority had not changed, and that he would make an announcement about those decisions before end of the year.</p>\n<p>So it was a constructive meeting.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that everybody in there agreed with the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision -- of course they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But it was a constructive meeting, and the fact that the meeting occurred is an indication of the strong relationship that endures between members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, other top advocates for immigration reform, and senior White House staff.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said earlier that there are no plans at this time to send a revised AUMF to Congress.\xc2\xa0 In the 16 months between the National Defense University speech and now, what, if any, progress has been made on revising, refining or repealing the 2001 AUMF?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, I can tell you that there are obviously a number of members of Congress who have strong views on this topic, and I know that there have been some conversations that have occurred, particularly on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 There have also been some conversations between senior White House staffers and members of Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Over the last 13 months, there have been a variety of other priorities that have cropped up, but this is an issue that the President has spoken about rather eloquently, and it does reflect a view that the President strongly holds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there have been meetings at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail all of the interactions on this topic.\xc2\xa0 But it is something that remains on the radar screen of the White House, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, heard from many members of Congress who continue to keep this issue on their radar screen as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Iraq government is the lynchpin -- the new Iraq government, the inclusive Iraq government -- is the lynchpin in many ways of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy.\xc2\xa0 That government is days old and potentially vulnerable.\xc2\xa0 Is there a contingency plan to defend that government if the members of that leadership are threatened by ISIS?\xc2\xa0 Is there any military contingency or other contingency if they are threatened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, the President has already ordered military action in support of efforts by the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish security forces.\xc2\xa0 And in the speech that the President delivered on Wednesday night, he indicated a willingness to ramp up the assistance and support that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing to the Iraqi and Kurdish security forces -- this includes both strengthening and enhancing the training and equipment that is being provided to them.\xc2\xa0 It also means ramping up the kind of air support that the American military has already provided to Iraqi security forces and Kurdish security forces as they take the fight on the ground to ISIL in their country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about contingencies for if the government is internally not solvent?\xc2\xa0 What if there\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of -- again, this is something -- Abadi became Prime Minister-designate about a month ago; the government officially a couple days ago.\xc2\xa0 If this becomes something that\xe2\x80\x99s not the future government of Iraq, what is our contingency plan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, like you said, Jared, the government is just a few days old at this point.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the Iraqi government to work closely with this broader international coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the United States to help them defend their country.</p>\n<p>And ultimately, there is a key principle here, which is that the United States cannot take responsibility for the security situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The Iraqi government, the Iraqi security forces, and, ultimately, the Iraqi people need to step up and take that responsibility.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll do so with the support of the international community and the United States.\xc2\xa0 Those are very powerful friends to have, but ultimately, this is a task that they must take on themselves.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, going back to the sanctions issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this in a series of increasingly tough sanctions that the U.S. and the Europeans have enacted.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, today, we heard senior officials describing continuing, in their words, \xe2\x80\x9cillegal and destabilizing Russian actions in Ukraine.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So can you point to any single impact on the military side -- not the Russian economy, which you talk about all the time -- but on the military side, that these sanctions have had to stop the Russians from illegal and destabilizing actions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start with the economic impact, because it\xe2\x80\x99s important that people not overlook that -- that there has been a significant toll taken on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 It can be measured in a variety of ways -- everything from the significant sums of money that the Russian Central Bank has expended to try to prop up the Russian currency, to the tabulations of significant capital flight that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Russia.\xc2\xa0 Russia relies on and values the kind of international investments that\xe2\x80\x99s been important to their economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen that private capital flowing in the other direction because Russia has become increasingly isolated.</p>\n<p>The Russian financial markets are not performing at the same level as comparable economies.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen international organizations roll back their projections for Russian economic growth in the future because of the sanctions that have been put in place.\xc2\xa0 So there has been a tangible economic effect.\xc2\xa0 The question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, though, is a legitimate one, which is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that translate into anything that has impacted at all on the military side?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would say that in two ways, that there has been an impact.\xc2\xa0 The first is that, as Ukraine was engaged in an effort to elect a new President, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, was vowing to not acknowledge the results of that election, but yet, just a couple of weeks ago, Vladimir Putin traveled to Minsk to sit down across the negotiating table from that newly -- relatively newly elected President of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That has been a pretty dramatic reversal, as it relates to the position of Russia and the elected leader of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The second thing is -- and in some ways this might be more important -- we have seen early indications that Russia is living up to the cease-fire agreement that was reached just last week, and that involves some troop movements and some other things.\xc2\xa0 We have also seen those kinds of encouraging signs be quickly reversed.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be irrationally exuberant about those early indications, but yet, they are an indication that -- at least preliminarily, that Russia is living up to aspects of that cease-fire agreement.</p>\n<p>But I think the other -- this is the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about your question -- there are other things that we want Russia to do, and we believe that they should do, to demonstrate their respect for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, and to demonstrate their respect for basic international norms about the sovereignty of other countries.</p>\n<p>So I think everybody who has participated in the effort to impose sanctions on Russia would acknowledge that there is more that needs to be done by Russia.\xc2\xa0 And that, by definition almost, means that Russia hasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that the sanctions haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet had the desired effect.</p>\n<p>But the United States, in coordination with our allies, has spoken pretty clearly with a united voice about the need for Russia to live up to these basic international commitments and international norms.\xc2\xa0 And the international community -- the United States included -- is prepared to start to roll back these sanctions if we see Russia start to live up to the kinds of agreements that they have made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Putin.\xc2\xa0 Does the President trust him on any level?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President himself has described the kinds of conversations and the relationship that he has with President Putin I believe as \xe2\x80\x9cbusinesslike.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I do think that is the kind of give-and-take that they have with one another; that the President is able to speak pretty bluntly with President Putin, and I believe that President Putin feels like he can speak pretty bluntly in return.\xc2\xa0 That is a useful and constructive channel of dialogue between those two world leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are, despite our differences -- our strong differences -- with Russia about their behavior in Ukraine, there are other areas where we have been able to advance both of our nations\xe2\x80\x99 interests on some other topics.\xc2\xa0 The P5-plus-1 negotiations in Iran is probably the best example of that -- actually, the best example of that is probably the removal of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemical weapons stockpile.\xc2\xa0 That was something --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you answered the question, though.\xc2\xa0 Does he trust Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say, Peter, is that they do have a very businesslike exchange of ideas when they talk.\xc2\xa0 And their relationship -- or the relationship between the two countries has yielded results that are positive for the United States and positive for Russia.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication of at least a functioning relationship between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that you have two world leaders who are able to interact in a constructive way.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\xc2\xa0 Josh.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about the comparison to a year ago and the resolution? \xc2\xa0At that time, not only did the President say in his public remarks that he wanted Congress to have a vote -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he said up or down, but some kind of a direct vote -- on the use of military force in that context, the White House actually sent a draft resolution to Capitol Hill, which I think Senator Mendendez or Senator Reid introduced to be considered.\xc2\xa0 Events moved on, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 Why is the stance different now?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this in fact a more significant undertaking than a couple of -- what was reported to be a couple of nights of bombing of Syria versus what aids are indicating could be a two-year campaign, a three-year campaign against ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, frankly, recall the provision of the working draft of a resolution, but I take your word for it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall that.\xc2\xa0 I do have the President\xe2\x80\x99s language in front of me:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine and ultimately repeal the AUMF\xe2\x80\x99s mandate, and I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further.\xc2\xa0 Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about that speech.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the Syria chemical weapons situation from just a year ago --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- where he said we should have an up-or-down vote, and -- why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he using that language in connection with this new effort that seems broader?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re two different situations.\xc2\xa0 The President, in this case, believes that he does have the authority that he needs under the statutory authority, under the 2001 AUMF to carry out the military actions that he has ordered thus far.\xc2\xa0 Those actions, again, would not include the deployment of ground combat troops into Iraq or Syria, and all of this would take place under the rubric of a broader international coalition.</p>\n<p>The situation last year was different.\xc2\xa0 The goal here is to deny a safe haven to ISIL, and to degrade and ultimately destroy them.\xc2\xa0 The situation that we were talking about a little over a year ago was related to the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And those are just two different circumstances.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he did say in his speech a year ago that he thought he had the authority there, too, to do what he needed to do, but nevertheless he wanted a resolution from Congress.\xc2\xa0 And if there are differences between this situation and that, don\xe2\x80\x99t they lean in favor of getting Congress more clearly on the record in this case?\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a much more massive undertaking.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not really a question of whether the law requires him to do it; he said it\xe2\x80\x99s healthy when Congress is explicit about these things and supporting him.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it even more important in this case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is exactly why the administration would welcome a show of support from Congress for the strategy that the President has put in place here.\xc2\xa0 There is, in the view of the President, a very clear national security interest about why the President has ordered the military action that he has, and we would certainly welcome a show of support from Congress.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the President and his national security team have determined that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- that he has very clearly the authority that he needs under the previous AUMF to order that military action.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Josh -- just to follow up on -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that the President would like a vote from Congress on this, just as Josh was just asking about -- just like he wanted a year ago?\xc2\xa0 And the reason why he is not explicitly asking for a vote -- although he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly implying it with that sentence you just read -- is that congressional leaders, Democratic congressional leaders, have said they don\xe2\x80\x99t want a vote right now -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what\xe2\x80\x99s really going on here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on is that the President believes he has the authorization that he needs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As he did a year ago.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And in this case, he has -- for the reasons that I described earlier to your colleague\xe2\x80\x99s question, about why he has the authority that he needs under the 2001 AUMF.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has taken the reasonable position that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the policy that he laid out in his speech at the National Defense University a little over a year ago -- has said that he would welcome a show of support from Congress for the strategy that the President has put forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that is the reasonable position that the President has pursued.\xc2\xa0 And this is a position that the President and his national security team have discussed at length with members of Congress in both parties who are interested in this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s put that in language that Congress -- describes what Congress actually does, shows of support and not a technical term of a congressional action here.\xc2\xa0 The President would welcome a vote from Congress explicitly authorizing this, is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Would he welcome such a vote?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is true, Jon, that there are a range of ways that Congress could indicate their support.\xc2\xa0 That would include a vote, and that would include the range of things that the President would welcome.</p>\n<p>The President does not, however, believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he needs.\xc2\xa0 What he needs right now is the specific Title 10 authority related to the training-and-equipping mission of the -- that he would like the Department of Defense to carry out to expand the capacity and strengthen the capacity of the Syrian opposition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Bill Clinton was here today, I believe I saw on the South Lawn.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I noticed.\xc2\xa0 Always nice to have him back, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure thing.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have some time to sit down with the former President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do understand that they were going to visit a little bit before the event.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they were going to have a formal meeting of any kind, but I was not -- I did not -- unfortunately, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity to see the former President while he was here.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that they had a chance to visit a little bit before the event.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because I know the President reached out to former National Security Advisors for some counsel and their views on the situation with the Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 So has the President similarly reached out to former President Clinton or former Secretary of State Clinton for their views on how to handle this threat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the nature of the conversation that they had today.\xc2\xa0 Even if I were aware of it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even other days.\xc2\xa0 I mean, has there been any --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out any sort of -- any conversations between the President and his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration hasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to call this a war on ISIS, but is it not a war?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Michelle.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple things that I would say about that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the first thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is the President has made clear how the strategy that he is pursuing in Iraq and Syria to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is different than the strategy that was pursued in the previous Iraq war.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has been clear that American ground combat troops would not be deployed into Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 The President has indicated how serious he is about building a true international coalition, where you will have governments in the region and our allies around the world contributing to this broader effort to deny ISIL a safe haven in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that happens in wars as well.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but this is -- the reason that I say this again is, as the President and Secretary Kerry have described, this is consistent with the counterterrorism strategy that this administration has successfully implemented in a variety of other places around the globe.\xc2\xa0 The question that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, though, goes to sort of the central question that is important for people to understand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is not a situation where it\xe2\x80\x99s the United States against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, ISIL has indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to go to war against the world.\xc2\xa0 And this President, as is expected of American Presidents, is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat and to deny ISIL a safe haven.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So I think what you could conclude from this is the United States is at war with ISIL in the same way that we are at war with al Qaeda and its al Qaeda affiliates all around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Got it.\xc2\xa0 And in Syria, we know now that it was sort of strange the way it came up but the Assad regime is saying that it would help in the effort to defeat ISIS in Syria but any unilateral action by the United States would be seen as aggression.\xc2\xa0 So now U.S.-trained fighters -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big risk that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces will just double down and be fighting them while they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fight ISIS, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that already.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the United States is looking to ramp up the assistance that we provide to Syrian opposition fighters to give them greater capacity to take on ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And they will have, and what will impact the equation if not change it completely, is they will have the backing of the United States military in the form of military airstrikes working alongside them and coordinating with them as they attempt to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But indirectly, these U.S. forces are going to be training them to not only fight ISIS but they\xe2\x80\x99re also going to be having to simultaneously fight Assad forces.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if that\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be trained to do, yes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As many of you have noted, we have a longstanding policy as relates to the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We believe that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on and what this international coalition is focused on is confronting the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL and making sure that the international community can act and support the Syrian fighters on the ground to deny ISIL a safe haven in Syria.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that the failed leadership of President Assad is the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re in this situation.\xc2\xa0 The reason that ISIL has a safe haven in Syria today is because of the failure of President Assad to lead that country in a way that would unite that country to meet the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the international community is being forced to step in here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to support the opposition fighters, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to build this broader international coalition.\xc2\xa0 These Syrian opposition fighters will be backed up with military support and air support from the United States, and potentially other members of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 And that will certainly enhance their capacity and their ability to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and very quickly, just because we heard late last night from Jim Foley\xe2\x80\x99s mother saying a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things that sort of stuck out was saying that the U.S. government told the family that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise a ransom.\xc2\xa0 And we know the U.S. stance on paying ransoms in general, but she said that she was told that the family would be prosecuted if they tried to do that on their own.\xc2\xa0 Did the government tell them that?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, let me start out by saying something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before but it continues to be true today, which is the thoughts and prayers of everyone here at the White House are with the Foley family.\xc2\xa0 The grief that they\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing right now is unthinkable and the sadness that they must be feeling is devastating.\xc2\xa0 And our thoughts and prayers are with them in this very difficult time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is very concerned about Americans who are in a situation where they have been taken hostage by violent extremists and there are a number of examples of the President using every tool at our disposal to try to secure the release and safe return of those individuals.\xc2\xa0 That was true in the case of Mr. Foley as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States was in contact with more than two dozen countries to try to gather information or intelligence that could lead to the rescue of Mr. Foley.\xc2\xa0 Representatives from across the government, including the FBI, the intelligence community, the State Department, and even officials here at the White House were in regular touch with the Foley family to provide them updates about the situation and to communicate to them that his return and his rescue continued to be a priority of this administration.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I will say is that the President was so convinced that this was a priority that he ordered a high-risk mission that was successfully executed to try to secure the release and rescue of Mr. Foley.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, and despite the way in which that mission was executed -- that is to say, successfully -- it did not end in the release of Mr. Foley.\xc2\xa0 But it is an indication that elements of the U.S. government were willing to take a significant risk and expend significant resources to secure his release.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. tell them that they would be prosecuted if they tried to raise a ransom?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.\xc2\xa0 It is the longstanding policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage-taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization, and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they\xe2\x80\x99re at even greater risk.\xc2\xa0 So it is the policy of this administration, and it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the policy that was in place in other administrations as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But theoretically, if someone did pay a ransom to ISIS to get their loved one back, would the U.S. government try to prosecute that person?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice about how that law is implemented.\xc2\xa0 But it is -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what our policy is and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that that policy is in place both to try to prevent extremist organizations from having access to regular sources of funding but also to try to enhance the safety of American citizens around the globe.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the effort to defeat ISIS, would the U.S. conduct an attack that had the indirect effect of aiding Bashar al-Assad?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, that is a -- our actions in Syria are taking place, or would take place, in the midst of a rather difficult situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of different factions that are on the ground there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the policy that this administration has put in place has very clear guidelines.\xc2\xa0 Our priority is to deny ISIL a safe haven from which they could plot and execute a significant terrorist attack against the West, including the U.S. homeland.\xc2\xa0 That is a -- Osama bin Laden exposed how dangerous it is for a terrorist organization to have a safe haven, and this President has indicated that it is a clear principle of his presidency that he will take action to deny a safe haven to those organizations that seek to do harm to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of the policy also, don\xe2\x80\x99t help Assad?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Part of our policy is also that we believe that President Assad has the legitimacy to lead his country.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned to Michelle, it is our view -- and I think this is pretty clear -- that the consequence, the clear consequence of President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership and failed governance is the kind of vacuum that ISIL has stepped into and filled with their brand of violent, despicable extremism.</p>\n<p>And it is only because of that failed leadership on the part of President Assad that ISIL is in a position to try to capitalize on a virtual safe haven in Syria that would allow them to expand their scope and potentially do the necessary planning and plotting to strike the U.S. homeland.\xc2\xa0 The President is determined to use every element of American power to make sure that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a war with ISIS or ISIL aimed at American voters, or potential Middle East allies, or congressional representatives who say the President needs to go to them for authorization?\xc2\xa0 Is it aimed at any of those people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, I think what our aim here is, is to be as clear as possible about our strategy.\xc2\xa0 And the strategy that this administration has put in place is a counterterrorism strategy that has been successful in other areas where there are extremist groups seeking a safe haven to do harm to the United States of America.</p>\n<p>So the United States -- this counterterrorism strategy includes building up the capacity of local forces to take the fight to these extremist groups on the ground in their country.\xc2\xa0 This strategy includes the deployment of American military assets, principally airstrikes that could be used in support of those ground forces to aid their effort to take the fight to these extremist organizations.\xc2\xa0 And it includes building the kind of international coalition that can powerfully support local governments and national governments as they take the fight to these extremist organizations.\xc2\xa0 This is a strategy --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a war.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s worked in other places, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that we anticipate will be successful in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear about this:\xc2\xa0 what the President has said is that this is not a situation of ISIL against the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>ISIL is waging a war against the broader international community.\xc2\xa0 And the President is determined to build and lead an international coalition to take the fight to them.\xc2\xa0 So in the same way that the United States is at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates around the globe, the United States is at war with ISIL.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, in a very general sense, does the President as a constitutional scholar believe that the War Powers Act is constitutional?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is a constitutional scholar; I am not.\xc2\xa0 And so I would be hesitant to sort of opine on the legal merits and strengths and weaknesses of a particular --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if the President believes that it is.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him so it would be hard for me to talk about that from here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say that the administration has repeatedly demonstrated our willingness to comply with the requirements of the war powers report -- or the War Powers Act.\xc2\xa0 We have filed numerous war power reports with Congress related to the movement of troops and military activities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start any sort of clock for congressional action.\xc2\xa0 I believe a notification would start a 60-day clock.</p>\n<p>*MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of notifications that have been filed in the context of the current conflict in [Iraq]Syria.\xc2\xa0 Again, that was related to some ground troops that have been deployed specifically to strengthen protections of the embassy, to serve in the joint operation centers with Iraqi security forces, and some forces that are related to an advise-and-assist mission.</p>\n<p>But let me get to this other part of it, which is that -- so we have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the requirements of the War Powers Act.\xc2\xa0 That said, as we enter this next phase of the conflict, this more offensive phase of the conflict, as the President described it, the President believes he has the statutory authority that he needs to order military operations to deny ISIL a safe haven, and ultimately destroy that organization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more piece of statutory authority that he needs is Title 10 authority.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a precondition for expanding the air campaign into Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 It is a core component that compliments this element of our strategy.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated -- or at least -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t indicated -- Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have indicated that they support giving the administration this authority.\xc2\xa0 I believe somebody asked me yesterday if the completion of the training mission of Syrian fighters would be required before the President would authorize airstrikes in Syria, or begin to carry out airstrikes in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has said is that he\xe2\x80\x99s still reviewing the materials that have been prepared for him by the Department of Defense, but that he is ready and prepared to act but will do so at a time and place of our choosing.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we would announce too far in advance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that brings us back to -- the central question is, assuming that the campaign is successful in pushing them back from the Syrian strongholds, if that moderate vetted opposition, as the administration terms it, is not trained to move into that space, who moves into that space?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be U.S. ground combat troops.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xc2\xa0 There are elements of the Syrian opposition that have already been receiving both military and non-military assistance from the United States for more than a year now.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been widely reported that there are other regional governments that have been seeking to assist the -- or offer assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the responsibility for taking the fight to ISIL on the ground in Syria can and should be Syrian fighters.\xc2\xa0 And the question is, what kind of support can we offer them?\xc2\xa0 And in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, the international community can provide support to them in two ways.</p>\n<p>One is ramping up our training and equipping mission.\xc2\xa0 And two is the deployment of American and allied airstrikes in support of their efforts on the ground; that that will have an impact, and alter the equation on the ground as they take the fight to ISIL in their country.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify what you said about the distinction between counterterrorism and war because earlier today, Rear Admiral John Kirby at the Pentagon briefing said something almost identical to what you said -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to quote him -- \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the Iraq war of 2002, but make no mistake, we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war and continue to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to, since it seems to be almost direct wording, is this a message from the administration that we are at war with ISIL or ISIS?\xc2\xa0 Semantics do seem to matter here.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Semantics matter in our line of work, both yours and mine, Chris.\xc2\xa0 And I think what -- Admiral Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s comments are an indication that the administration at the Department of Defense, here at the White House, and I expect that my colleagues at other agencies will be asked as well, it is important for people here in the United States and around the world to understand that the strategy that the United States is pursuing at the direct order of the President of the United States is different than the strategy that was previously pursued in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are not contemplating a significant commitment of ground troops to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not contemplating the deployment of ground troops into combat in Iraq or in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out is consistent with the counterterrorism strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued in places all around the globe.</p>\n<p>And our intention and our determination to build an international coalition to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL is a top national security priority of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s in line with a core principle the President has laid out to deny ISIL and other terrorist organizations that seek to do harm to the United States a safe haven anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>And so in the same way that we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates around the globe, we are at war with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But make no mistake, when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking just about the United States.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about this broader international coalition that includes Sunni-led governments in the region and our allies around the world who are united in confronting this threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the definition of war does not need to include ground troops?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let other people determine what the precise legal or academic definition of war may be.\xc2\xa0 What it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand -- setting aside the specific definition -- is, A, how this strategy is significantly different than the strategy that was pursued in the previous Iraq war; B, they need to understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a broad international coalition; C, they need to understand that this is consistent with the counterterrorism strategy that the President has employed in other places in a way that has made the American people safer; and, D, they need to understand that this strategy is one that is being pursued not just by the United States alone, but by a broad international coalition that\'s being led by the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in believing that and in deciding that the AUMF covered this latest round, did the Justice Department provide a written analysis for the President, a legal analysis?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, Chris, I don\'t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 You should check with the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I will say that even if they have, I don\'t know if they\xe2\x80\x99d be in a position to provide private legal advice to the President, to the public.\xc2\xa0 But you should check with them and find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can ask another question to follow up on what Michelle was asking about the Foley family because -- and this concern that they had that they said that they were told by the government that they would be prosecuted if they tried to raise a ransom.\xc2\xa0 You stated, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve stated many times before, that it is the policy of the U.S. government not to pay ransom.\xc2\xa0 But you referred us and said, \xe2\x80\x9chow that law is implemented, you should check with Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Obviously there is a difference between policy and law.\xc2\xa0 Is there a law that suggests that someone could be prosecuted if they paid ransom to what the United States might deem a terrorist organization?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I was trying to clarify is I can speak to our policy, and our policy for a good reason, and for a reason that involves the safety and well-being of Americans across the globe, is that we do not pay ransom to terrorist organizations that take hostages.</p>\n<p>But as it relates to the law, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s their responsibility to understand what the laws are and how they\'re enforced.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to that from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, would it have been the Justice Department folks who spoke with the Foley family about this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do believe that there were some Justice Department officials who were in touch with the Foley family.\xc2\xa0 But I can\'t speak to the nature of their conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Foleys said -- the Foley family says the military officials told them of this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into who said what in the context of these individual conversations.\xc2\xa0 As I described earlier, there were a range of officials in the administration who were in touch with the Foley family.\xc2\xa0 It was the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and even some officials here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail the nature of those conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They said specifically military officials warned them of prosecution if they paid ransom money.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Wendell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail the specific conversations that they may have had.\xc2\xa0 I will observe, however, that the large number of conversations that were -- that occurred between a variety of officials here in this administration is indicative of the resources that were dedicated to trying to secure the safe return of Mr. Foley.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Lalit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 In Afghanistan, the auditing of ballots is over.\xc2\xa0 And in Kabul today, supporters of Abdullah Abdullah, one of the presidential candidates, had a large demonstration in which they alleged that the U.N. and the U.S. helped in rigging of votes in the presidential election.\xc2\xa0 My question is, to what extent are you hopeful that there will be a stable, unity government in Afghanistan, given the two candidates are still fighting among each other?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Lalit, as you know, the President spoke with Afghan presidential candidates Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Dr. Ashraf Ghani on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 He emphasized the importance of concluding a deal on the national unity government as soon as possible, in the interest of shoring up international support for Afghanistan and for preserving Afghan stability.\xc2\xa0 The President reaffirmed the United States\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to support Afghanistan, its people, and efforts to form a new unity government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition to the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations, the United States is continuing to engage with the candidates at the highest levels, including Secretary Kerry and Ambassador Cunningham, both of whom have been intensively involved in the situation.</p>\n<p>Everyone across the United States government that\'s been speaking to both candidates has encouraged them to abide by their commitments to the political process and to the formation of a unity government that helps secure the prosperity and stability of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been our policy for some time.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the policy that\'s been communicated by the President to them.\xc2\xa0 The President has had a number of telephone conversations with them throughout this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And our policy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve made specific commitments to a political process and to the formation of a national unity government.\xc2\xa0 And despite the challenging situation that they\'re operating in right now, we expect them to uphold the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of their country and their people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if there is no unity government, what impact would it have in terms of U.S. financial and military assistance to Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the key thing here, as everybody knows, is the signing of a bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 Both of these candidates have indicated a willingness to sign that agreement, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll need the President of Afghanistan and the senior members of the government to sign on and officially agree to that bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re watching.</p>\n<p>I think there are a host of other organizations that are watching to see what sort of security agreement Afghanistan has with the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that that will have an impact on the decisions that international organizations in other countries make about the presence they\xe2\x80\x99ll have in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for these candidates to keep the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made to the political process -- because it is important to shoring up international support for Afghanistan and preserving Afghan stability.</p>\n<p>Cheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Real quick, I just wanted to know about the status of funding for the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s any new funding in the CR.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\'s something you\xe2\x80\x99re going to look for later?\xc2\xa0 Or if that need has been -- I don\'t know -- abated.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen that the situation at the southwest border has significantly improved since the President announced some steps earlier this summer to deal with that challenge.\xc2\xa0 Those steps included shifting additional resources from the interior of the country to the border.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of intensive diplomatic efforts underway with Mexico and with countries in Central America where these -- many of those seeking to travel to this country originated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there was also a strategy that was put in place to open up detention centers, to hire additional judges and prosecutors and asylum specialists to preside over and participate in the proceedings that were related to processing these cases.</p>\n<p>So there was a lot of work that went into trying to deal with this flow.\xc2\xa0 And the situation is much better.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic that you asked me about this -- the last couple of days I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually brought slides in to illustrate this situation.\xc2\xa0 And of course, today I said, no, don\'t worry about the slides anymore, no one has asked about those in two days.\xc2\xa0 So maybe on Monday somebody can ask me about it and I can -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to see?\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even exaggerating it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s even a little PowerPoint thing that they gave.\xc2\xa0 But no one had ever -- no one had asked.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that on Monday.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something to look forward to on Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead, Josh.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But the point is that there are additional resources that the government would like to deal with --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are additional resources that we would like.\xc2\xa0 Congress has thus far failed to provide them.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly would like to see additional resources to deal with this challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one more, please?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to go to the week ahead, Goyal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Monday the President will award the Medal of Honor to Army Command Sergeant Major Bennie G. Adkins and to Army Specialist Four Donald P. Sloat for conspicuous gallantry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In the evening, the President will attend a DSCC event in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the briefing, the President will travel to Atlanta, Georgia to visit the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll receive a briefing on the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, discuss the U.S. response, and thank the scientists, doctors and health care workers helping those affected by the disease at home and around the world.</p>\n<p>The President will also receive a briefing while he\xe2\x80\x99s there on the respiratory illness reported in several states in the Midwest.\xc2\xa0 That evening, the President will travel to Tampa, Florida where he\xe2\x80\x99ll remain overnight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will visit U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.\xc2\xa0 And we talked through the things that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do there.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday evening, the President will return to the White House where he\xe2\x80\x99ll host a picnic for members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 That should be interesting.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the annual one?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is the annual.\xc2\xa0 That is the annual one.\xc2\xa0 So -- this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve traditionally done in the summertime.\xc2\xa0 We moved it to the fall to make it -- there were a couple of times, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, earlier in the administration where we canceled the picnic because it was so hot outside.\xc2\xa0 So we decided we\xe2\x80\x99d move it to a time when the weather might cooperate a little better.</p>\n<p>On Thursday morning, the President will participate in an ambassador credentialing ceremony in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 At this event, the President will receive the credentials from foreign ambassadors recently posted in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The presentation of credentials is a traditional ceremony that marks the formal beginning of an ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s service in Washington.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, the President will host President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The visit will highlight the United States\xe2\x80\x99 firm commitment to stand with the Ukraine as it pursues democracy, independence and stability.\xc2\xa0 President Obama looks forward to discussing with President Poroshenko efforts to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, as well as our continued support for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s struggle to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>That evening, Thursday evening, the President will attend a DNC event in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>And then on Friday, the President will wrap up a very busy week by participating in an event with the DNC\xe2\x80\x99s Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership Forum here in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>With that, I wish you all a good weekend.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M.
