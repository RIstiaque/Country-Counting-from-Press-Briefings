Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:04 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How is everyone today?\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here, as ever.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top, so I\'ll go straight to Ben Feller of the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I had a question that I think carries over from the campaign to the White House, so I\'ll give it a try here.\xc2\xa0 The campaign said today in a call that Governor Romney has either misrepresented himself on his SEC filings and committed a felony, or if not, he\'s not being honest with the American people about when he left Bain.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, just as a matter of principle and character, whether President Obama stands by that position, that he thinks Governor Romney is dishonest.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, the campaign I think did address this, so this is a campaign-specific question and I would direct most of your inquiries to the campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President feels very strongly that we need to take action in Washington to reward companies that insource, that bring jobs back to the United States, that build industries here in the United States, and to eliminate incentives that exist in our tax code that -- incentives to companies to outsource, to move jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 That\'s his position, and his record, his commitment, is demonstrated throughout his presidency to this general principle.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\'s been some discussion about the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 The entire purpose of the Recovery Act was to grow the American economy and grow American jobs here at home, and that\'s what it did.\xc2\xa0 It\'s widely recognized to have broken the back of the recession, to have reversed the situation where we were losing jobs at a rate of 750,000 per month to one where we\'ve created over 4.2 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 The Recovery Act alone is viewed by outside economists as having saved or created over 3 million jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it was one of the principles -- the Recovery Act had many components, but one was to provide direct relief to states to stop the hemorrhaging of jobs in areas like public schools and police and fire departments.\xc2\xa0 Another was to give the middle class a tax cut to help it weather this terrible recession.\xc2\xa0 And another was to make some long-term investments in industries that would help the economy grow in the future, and that includes in the clean energy industry.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one of the successes of the Recovery Act was getting companies that had the choice of building facilities in China or India or Europe or the United States to make the choice to build in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And there is example after example of that -- the advanced battery industry is a good one.\xc2\xa0 It was virtually nonexistent, when this President took office, in this country, had about 3 -- U.S. companies, U.S. facilities had about 3 percent of the market, and we\'re well on our way to having a substantial portion of that market because of the investments in the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I can talk about the President\'s position on insourcing versus outsourcing, his demand that Congress act to end incentives that encourage companies to outsource.\xc2\xa0 But for campaign-related specifics, I\'d refer you to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One quick follow on that before going on to another subject.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this goes straight to the President, so I\'ll try -- when Romney became the presumptive nominee, the President called him and -- I\'m paraphrasing here but essentially said, congratulations, and we ought to have a big debate about the future of the country.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that what\'s happening right now, this debate about who\'s telling the truth, who\'s lying, is this befitting of a presidential campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that there is a great deal at stake in this election.\xc2\xa0 You hear him say often that this election in many ways might be more consequential than the last one.\xc2\xa0 What we have now is a situation where there are two starkly different visions about how we need to move the country forward economically.\xc2\xa0 He remarks -- and I think it is remarkable, as somebody who covered it -- that the President succeeded a Republican who believed in immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He ran against a Republican who believed that climate change was real.\xc2\xa0 There has been a -- the differences between the two parties and their positions and their visions have become more and more stark in a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe matter of tax fairness, the issue of what you would do to encourage the development of economic -- the development of industries here in the United States to create jobs for American workers here in the United States, and what you would do to prevent or discourage companies from outsourcing -- those are fundamental matters of debate, because, as the President said, he could not agree more with the idea that the economy is the number-one issue in this debate.\xc2\xa0 And he is very interested in having that discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, if you\'re referring to the article in the Boston Globe, that was a piece of reporting by your colleagues that -- it\'s not something the campaign produced.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s an interesting read, but beyond that, I would refer you to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other topic is the Penn State report.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President has been made aware of the findings or -- and if the White House has a reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken with him about that today, but I suspect he is aware.\xc2\xa0 He addressed this not long ago and I think he made an observation that I know he feels deeply, which is that what happened at Penn State is a reminder that institutions have -- individuals and institutions have grave responsibilities to make sure that our children are taken care of and protected.\xc2\xa0 And it is an indication perhaps that -- well, it is a clear indication that that responsibility was not taken with the seriousness that it needs to be taken by institutions across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s a devoted sports fan so followed this story.\xc2\xa0 And again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with him about it yet today but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can the President do more to show leadership on being transparent with regard to documents, records, his own background?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s another sort of underlying theme here that the campaigns are clearly going at.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about Donald Trump?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not talking about Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask me a specific question. I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s record of unprecedented levels of transparency in the White House is well established.\xc2\xa0 His record as a candidate, both when he ran for the Senate and when he ran for President in 2008 and now as a candidate for reelection, in terms of transparency is a solid one and reflects a long tradition of being an open book, as I think he described it when he was asked this question not long ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s part of the process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not always pleasant or comfortable, but it has become a well-established tradition in our country to make available information about one\xe2\x80\x99s private dealings.\xc2\xa0 That just comes with the territory.\xc2\xa0 So he not only accepts that but practices and believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know this has been asked for years, but one thing that people -- at least on the -- among his opponents, continue to bring up is the -- his college records.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 This is a Donald Trump question, which I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- he\xe2\x80\x99s the one who brings it up the most.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s the answer to that particular question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 It is preposterous -- this is from the guy who insisted that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President was born in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it is funny, every once in a while when I sit back in my office and remember all the things that seemed to be the most important issue of the day, and there were briefings after briefings where that was the most important issue of the day, to the point where we had to solicit the long form of the President\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on transparency is extremely sound.\xc2\xa0 He has provided the kind of documentation that candidates for President have now, by tradition, provided for 30 years.\xc2\xa0 And he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, swapping to one -- sorry -- last non-campaign or transparency-related question.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t confirm that this ambassador had defected.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that the Syrian ambassador to Iraq defected.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s response was, "you can\xe2\x80\x99t quit, you\xe2\x80\x99re fired" -- which is another sign of the desperation, I think, that is enveloping the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing daily now more and more indications that Assad is losing his grip, that those around him, both in his inner circle and more broadly in the military and governmental leadership, are beginning to assess Assad\xe2\x80\x99s chances of remaining in power, and hopefully beginning to assess Assad\xe2\x80\x99s legacy -- his legacy of brutality -- and making the choice that they will abandon him in favor of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 So this is another example of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, can you confirm the ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s location?\xc2\xa0 There are reports that he\xe2\x80\x99s in Qatar.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I cannot confirm that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And going back to some of the questions yesterday about the President not speaking to the NAACP -- you referred most of those questions to the campaign, and yet President Obama delivered a videotaped message that seemed to have been taped in the White House.\xc2\xa0 So why does this fall under the umbrella of the campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the campaign is handling a lot of his scheduling for campaign-related events.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s opponent appeared, and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President films a lot of videos -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this one -- but to events that he cannot attend or is not able to attend for scheduling reasons or whatever reason.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure what room he filmed it in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know when he filmed it, and was it because there were a lot of questions about the fact that he was not going to be attending --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly when he filmed it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was recently.\xc2\xa0 He, as you know, films his weekly address and other video messages every week, and it is absolutely routine when he does not -- or is not able to attend an event, but wants to be able to send a message, that he will videotape that message and provide it to the convention or conference or gathering in his stead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not announce yesterday, when you got all of these questions about it, he would be delivering a videotaped address?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re reading something into this that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The issue was would he attend and why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he attend.\xc2\xa0 He provides a video as a matter of routine to events he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t attend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just following up also on the discussions about the sequester -- you said yesterday that the OMB is developing an analysis in case the sequester should be put in place.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of where specifically they are in that analysis? And at what point do they begin to contact other departments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date-specific for that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you know the sequester is written not to take effect until the beginning of next year, as I understand it.\xc2\xa0 As we have made clear, should it get to the point where Congress has failed to do its job, as dictated by Congress, and the sequester may take effect, OMB and DOD and the various agencies will be ready.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we do not believe that should come to pass.\xc2\xa0 The whole point of the Budget Control Act was to create a trigger, a forcing mechanism that was so onerous that nobody wanted it to come to pass.\xc2\xa0 The defense cuts, the President agrees, are too steep; the non-defense cuts, the President believes, are too steep.\xc2\xa0 That is why Congress needs to come together and make some hard choices around the kind of balanced proposal that the President and every other person who has looked at this seriously, including bipartisan commissions, agrees must be taken in order to deal with our long-term deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished, in spite of all the rancor and disagreement, close to $2 trillion -- I think $2 trillion in non-defense discretionary cuts.\xc2\xa0 There is more that needs to be done, and we need to address that through a balanced approach that Congress needs to take up.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how we avoid the sequester, which was never meant to be implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in talking yesterday about tax cuts, you mentioned that the President was always open to compromise.\xc2\xa0 So I want to ask you, how locked in is the $250,000 ceiling?\xc2\xa0 I mean, could it be adjusted to $500,000 or $1 million?\xc2\xa0 Is there some play?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said -- and I appreciate the question -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is what it has always been. He will not extend tax cuts to the wealthiest 2 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to extending, and believes we should make permanent, tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpaying Americans -- a middle-class tax cut for Americans who need it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is because we simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to spend another close to a trillion dollars over 10 years on tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of American earners.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons why we have the fiscal situation that led to the super committee and the Budget Control Act and the negotiations last year is because those two tax cuts were promoted by the previous President, passed through Congress and signed into law, and were totally unpaid for.\xc2\xa0 And what we saw, as a result in part of those policies and many other policies that were implemented, was the slowest job creation of any expansion in recent memory.\xc2\xa0 We saw the middle class put under even greater stress and saw its incomes stagnate and shrink while more affluent Americans saw their wealth increase.\xc2\xa0 And if all that weren\xe2\x80\x99t bad enough, we had the great recession, the worst financial and economic crisis of our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not that hard to deduce that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that again.\xc2\xa0 What we should do, since we all agree it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- is extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 Pass it now -- the President will sign it right away.\xc2\xa0 And then we can continue to debate whether or not the right economic policy, the right policy to improve job creation, to improve economic growth in our country is to give more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I understand that there are people in Washington who believe that is the right policy.\xc2\xa0 There are candidates for office who believe that is the right policy, that that is the ticket -- that is the key to future economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And that is a debate we should have.\xc2\xa0 But we should not hold 98 percent of American taxpayers hostage.\xc2\xa0 We should not say you\'re not going to get a tax hike unless the wealthiest 2 percent get a tax cut. We should all agree on the idea that 98 percent of American taxpayers should get a tax cut, get that security and certainty, and then debate the issue of tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know, there are supporters of the President, Democratic leaders who think they can -- who calculated they could go up to a million dollars and still have sufficient revenue to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President firmly believes that we cannot afford to extend tax cuts over $250,000.\xc2\xa0 He has made his position clear.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve seen broad support from Democrats for the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope to see the Senate given the opportunity to vote on that proposal in the near future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Was the President serious on Monday when he said -- challenged Congress for an immediate vote on this?\xc2\xa0 Because yesterday in the Senate, twice during floor action, that was proposed so long as they voted on something else as well, a different version as well.\xc2\xa0 And both times it was -- did the President discuss that with the Democratic leaders?\xc2\xa0 And did --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was deadly serious.\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday -- and as I think if you dig into it will recognize what was proposed in a gimmick by Senator Hatch was not the President\'s proposal.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it left out the extension of the American Opportunity Tax Credit and other tax provisions that would have resulted, if that were passed, in a tax hike for 18 or 25 million American families.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that was a gimmick.\xc2\xa0 The Senate is in a process of considering very important tax relief for small businesses that the President has initiated and supports.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a vote, we hope, on the President\'s proposal, which includes all the middle-class tax cuts that were part of the President\'s plan. And he believes that there will be strong support from the Democratic Party for that -- and that there should be 100 percent support in the Senate, because -- I don\'t know, go to their websites -- doesn\'t everybody in the Republican Party support tax cuts for the middle class?\xc2\xa0 And if so, they should vote for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the NAACP speech, the Vice President\'s office says that that was a political appearance of his today.\xc2\xa0 And I assume that the President\'s video was a political one --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to -- the problem is I haven\'t seen it as I was just asked about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It looked like a radio -- a weekend address.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I think we were referring to the campaign on this because this is a question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is this.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President used the official presidential seal on his podium, as the President did on Friday at Carnegie Mellon, using the presidential seal, at what was clearly announced as a campaign.\xc2\xa0 Is he changing the policy now?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to start using the presidential seal --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'ve covered a number of Presidents, Ann, and you will find that many Presidents running for reelection have, when they stand in front of that particular podium, used the presidential seal.\xc2\xa0 It\'s government -- that podium is government property.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t hang campaign signs on it.\xc2\xa0 We use the presidential seal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in almost every one of President Obama\'s campaign appearances during this cycle, he has not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at -- again, we can have this discussion in more detail, but if you pay close attention to it and you look at the podium, you\'ll recognize that when that podium is used that we use the presidential seal.<br/>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to ask another question since Bill Press took mine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll give you a little time while -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 I got it.\xc2\xa0 I got it.\xc2\xa0 So, number one, should we expect some of the Iran sanctions to be coming today?\xc2\xa0 And since we\'re here now and they haven\'t yet, can you tell us, if so, what they are?\xc2\xa0 And also, can you talk to us a little bit about tomorrow\'s trip and any travel next week in terms of what he wants to accomplish from a policy perspective, as well as the politics of the travel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make on sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we have seen that the actions taken by this administration and with a great deal of unanimity around the world in isolating and pressuring Iran have had an impact, an economic impact on the regime in Tehran, which the leaders there have themselves acknowledged and spoken about.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to put pressure, working unilaterally and with our partners, on the Iranian regime until they make the right choice, which is to abide by their obligations to the United Nations, to the international community, with regards to their nuclear ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe that the upcoming travel that you\'re referring to is campaign travel.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point you make is a good one, which is that the President has been and will continue to talk about -- as well as his broader message that the campaign can discuss with you in more detail -- some very specific things that have to do with what Congress can do now, what we can do now to help the American economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that I think begins with what we\'ve been discussing already today, which is the need to have Congress extend the middle-class tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think I mentioned yesterday -- people -- "oh, isn\'t that just a political issue, because the Republicans aren\'t going to go along with it?\xc2\xa0 Republicans are complaining that you\'re trying to beat them over the head with this by supporting middle class tax cuts."\xc2\xa0 And my answer to that is if that is what you fear, then take the opportunity away from him by extending the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he wants.\xc2\xa0 He thinks it\'s right for the economy, he thinks it\'s right for the middle class, and would not be happier to sign that thing -- that bill right away if the opportunity presented itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick follow-up -- since it\'s turning into that season where so many days now he\'ll be on the road, and many of these days will be almost entirely campaign days for schedule purposes, how is he -- how have you guys broken out how he manages the time that he needs for policy stuff?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you can do all that stuff.\xc2\xa0 There\'s communication on the plane.\xc2\xa0 But if a foreign leader calls, the briefing is on actual issues and what\'s going on -- how do you schedule time into those days for him to do that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question and it\'s obviously one that every incumbent President must confront if he or she is running for reelection, as the President is.\xc2\xa0 We, as previous Presidents have, benefi+ted from the sophistication of the operations here in the White House that provides the kinds of communication capabilities that a President requires when he or she travels and that allows for the kind of instantaneous communications needs that a President has on the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he gets, as you know -- I think you and I talked about this a little either earlier this week or last week -- a President of the United States, even when he or she is running for reelection, is President of the United States 24 hours a day and seven days a week.\xc2\xa0 And, therefore, the presidency travels with him or her wherever he goes.\xc2\xa0 And that requires a national security staff and obviously -- Secret Service and other staff -- but other White House staff that travel with him, in addition to campaign staff who are helping him manage the events that he is engaged in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s no different from President George W. Bush when he ran for reelection or President Bill Clinton when he ran, and I\'m sure Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush before them.\xc2\xa0 But I remember some stories a few months ago that talked about how we were not ramping up quick enough.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to -- when I say "we", I mean that the campaign was not ramping up quick enough.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s first commitment is to his responsibilities in office.\xc2\xa0 And that is just a reality that you have to accept if you\'re President, that there are going to be times when the campaign has to wait because he has to make important decisions, have important conversations with foreign leaders, or meetings with staff and others -- members of Congress -- to get the work done that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, give me one second.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President discuss --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have to tell me who you are first.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m Tamara Keith, from NPR.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, somebody emailed me about that and then I blew it -- nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Did the President, when meeting with the congressional leaders yesterday, discuss any sort of a timeline for a vote on the middle-class tax cut proposal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we provided a readout.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a date specific for you.\xc2\xa0 They discussed a number of issues, including the middle-class tax cut, other items on the congressional agenda, actions that Congress can take to help small businesses, actions that Congress can take to put construction workers and teachers back to work.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a specific date for you.\xc2\xa0 I tend to leave Senate scheduling up to the Majority Leader.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 The criticism is that there isn\'t even language yet.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s that complicated.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to extend the so-called Bush tax cuts as well as the other middle-class tax cuts the President put into place for a year.\xc2\xa0 And these tax cuts go to 98 percent of American taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 He does not support and does not believe we can afford extending tax cuts for the top 2 percent in this country. And that is his position.\xc2\xa0 There will be an opportunity for the Senate to vote on that, as Majority Leader Reid has said, but I will leave it to him to announce when that\'s going to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on Margaret\'s line of questioning, I have no doubt that when there are urgent priorities that in his job as President he makes the time to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 But when it gets to the point where he\'s campaigning almost every day on the road, what goes?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s only so many hours in the day and he does still have to sleep, so where -- what is it that he has been doing all along that he won\'t have time for when he\'s in intensive campaign mode?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you might expect, and you have seen in previous administrations, that there is less foreign travel in a campaign reelection year.\xc2\xa0 Foreign travel tends to take up a great deal of time; it\'s very important.\xc2\xa0 This President has traveled widely in pursuit of American interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly the case that there will, I\'m sure, be fewer days out of the country this year for the President than in previous years.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a result of the reality of the campaign year.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut other than that, I think that there really is the opportunity between the days he\'s here and his capabilities when he\'s traveling, the opportunity to get the briefings he needs, have the interactions with foreign leaders that he needs, and congressional leaders that he needs.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned before, there will be times, I\'m sure, when a planned stop on a campaign -- for a campaign event has to be delayed or postponed or cancelled because of some pressing business of the presidency.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s just how it is.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s nothing to complain about, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\'s running for reelection and that\'s part of the process.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the seal, can you say why there was a change of policy in using the seal on lecterns at political events?\xc2\xa0 Your predecessor made it clear during the midterms that President Obama would not use the seal at purely political events.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I would just refer you to past practice of previous Presidents.\xc2\xa0 When this President is at campaign events that involve raising funds for the campaign, he uses campaign -- depending on the event, whether there\'s a podium or not.\xc2\xa0 In this case, as has been the practice of his predecessors running for reelection, there are times when it\'s entirely -- it is certainly in keeping with past precedent and appropriate to have the presidential seal on the podium behind which he is standing because he is actually the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not saying he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that two years ago you said one thing and now you\'re saying another.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that comment specifically, but I can tell you that this is in keeping with past precedent.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to photographs of previous Presidents running for reelection --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You understand that, right?\xc2\xa0 You seem doubtful, but I can find photos for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s a change for you now.\xc2\xa0 This is the first -- as far as we know, the first campaign event President Obama has done all year, at Carnegie Mellon he used the seal on a podium he uses all the time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve addressed this in detail.\xc2\xa0 Let me get to Brianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch Vice President Biden\'s address to the NAACP?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he was in meetings.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a TV in the Oval.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was it the CBS interview, is that why he couldn\'t go -- the scheduling conflict?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean preparation for it or something -- is that\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened either.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did that -- somehow did that figure into it?\xc2\xa0 So I mean, what was it?\xc2\xa0 What was the scheduling --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are meetings all the time.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who he\'s meeting -- he has the presidential daily briefing; he has -- as much as he would like to, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get to watch often me at the podium or -- maybe he wouldn\'t like that -- or members of his administration, Cabinet members speak.\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t guarantee you he didn\xe2\x80\x99t watch it because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in whatever meeting he was in, but I\'m pretty confident he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the tax cuts, the President has said that he would veto an across-the-board extension.\xc2\xa0 Would he veto anything over the $250,000 threshold?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is the reincarnation of you from yesterday and Bill from today.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe and it is not his position that we should extend tax cuts beyond the 98 percent who fall under the $250,000.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He will veto --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will veto, as I\'ve said and he has said, any extension of the high-end Bush tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- across the board.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it is -- there are no proposals for that.\xc2\xa0 Because then we could go, well, what about $251,000?\xc2\xa0 Or $332,000?\xc2\xa0 Or $723,000?\xc2\xa0 His position is -- look, and there\'s a reason for it, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that\'s generous in terms of the definition of middle class, right?\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly -- $250,000, it\'s only --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just makes --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- hold on -- there\'s only 2 percent of American earners who make more than that, first of all.\xc2\xa0 That 2 percent accounts for -- in the Bush tax cuts -- nearly a trillion dollars over 10 years, a trillion dollars that we cannot afford as we try to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 Two, it is important because sometimes when the questions are asked and this policy is explained, it is important to remember that everybody under this proposal gets a tax cut on their first $250,000 in earnings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo maybe some TV folks here -- I don\'t know -- who make more than that, you\'ll get -- if you make $500,000, you get a tax cut -- (laughter) -- on your first $250,000 of income.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not that if you\'re one of the wealthiest Americans you don\'t get any tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not asking about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I know, but I wanted to take this opportunity to explain that everyone -- every taxpaying American gets a benefit from this extension.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when he laid down the gauntlet on the across-the-board, and then you won\'t say veto -- you just say that\'s his position, you\'re not saying veto, it\'s just --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said veto.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Above the $250,000 threshold.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any proposals -- I can\'t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything between -- somewhere between -- it makes it seem like you\'re aware that you\'re asking for something you\'re not going to get.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Where is there some bill that you were talking about before that\'s being written perhaps as we speak that has it at $250,000 and 50 cents -- then I said he would veto it if it\'s over that.\xc2\xa0 He will not support legislation that extends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 The 2 percent threshold is a $250,000 threshold.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to take you to an obscure topic but it\'s an important one.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure it\'s actually been discussed in the briefing room -- Libor.\xc2\xa0 So my question to you is what lessons is the President taking from the trail that the Libor manipulation is leaving us with the CFTC\'s investigation of this bank and other banks that may be implicated?\xc2\xa0 What lesson is he taking?\xc2\xa0 I know we talked about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to -- London -- I was trying to pass that test this morning.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you and your questions to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\xc2\xa0 I have not had this conversation with the President, so I cannot address that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, as I understand it, they issued a statement the other day noting that after they received reports of problems with Libor, they shared suggestions with Libor -- this goes to the New York Fed part of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of the broader implications, I haven\'t had that conversation with him.\xc2\xa0 But I think, broadly speaking, this President took up the issue of Wall Street reform and is committed to its implementation because it\'s important that everybody play by the same set of rules and that -- not just because that\'s how it should be, but because it\'s important for our economy and it\'s important for the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s a broad statement about his position on things.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get too involved in Libor because I know it\'s under investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, and then Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This week you have criticized, and at times, kind of gently mocked Republicans\' definition in some cases of small businesses as including some hedge fund managers and lawyers and so forth.\xc2\xa0 Republicans, in turn, criticize the President\'s plan that his tax cut plan would benefit 97 percent of small businesses.\xc2\xa0 So here\'s my question --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear -- it\'s not a claim.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been established by the Joint Tax Center; it\'s been well documented by outside -- in fact, we\'re being kind in our definition of it because I believe the JTC said it was only 2.7 percent.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s really 97.3 percent of small businesses would fall under the -- even under the definition that the Republicans put forward do not have more than $250,000 in revenue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, to your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just our claim.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we are citing -- I think Ann asked me where did that come from, and we provided that information -- we even put it on the briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For a couple decades, under various presidential administrations, the Small Business Administration has been at times criticized by journalists for giving money to companies that are really not small businesses -- they\'re larger than small businesses.\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing kind of dispute.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s definition of a small business?\xc2\xa0 Is it based on the number of employees?\xc2\xa0 Is it based on the annual revenue?\xc2\xa0 What is it based -- does he have a definition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t had a -- I\'m not sure that he has his own personal definition.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that he looks to the SBA and the SBA Administrator for that.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, and I think the point that we are making here when we talk about this debate with Republicans who sort of ignore the fact that -- or try to ignore the fact that included in their definition of small businesses are hedge fund managers and law partners and others -- is that 97.3 percent of small businesses benefit from the extension of the tax cut who file in this way -- S corps who file in this way benefit from the extension of the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is simply not a viable claim to say that this is going after small businesses -- unless you want to argue that Warren Buffett and other folks, and hedge fund managers are small businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDid you know that by the Republican definition of small business, half of the Forbes 400 wealthiest individuals are small businesses?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s what most Americans have in mind when they think about -- when they hear politicians talk about -- and politicians of both parties talk about this that small business is the economic engine of economic growth.\xc2\xa0 They think of small businesses that hire a handful of employees -- or perhaps scores of employees -- but they don\'t think hedge funds, and they don\'t think of law firms.\xc2\xa0 They think of the kinds of small businesses that they see when they walk through their towns, and maybe the kinds of small businesses that they themselves own.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the debate we\'re happy to have because we\'re right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The SBA\'s definition of small businesses, depending upon what it\'s doing, from a manufacturing concern, have 1,500 workers.\xc2\xa0 And the criticism of the impact of the tax cuts is they would impact while only 2-and-change percent of the small businesses, nearly half the small business income -- and that\'s where the jobs are being created.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But again, that is, again, with a measure of -- do you know why there\'s a lot of income in that?\xc2\xa0 Because there\'s hedge fund managers and law partners who are making millions -- right?\xc2\xa0 And again, if you\'re a small business and you file under the personal income tax code, if you\'re an S corps, and you make $275,000, you get a tax cut on $250,000.\xc2\xa0 And you benefit from every other tax cuts for small businesses that this President has passed and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 And if you\'re a small business that\'s willing to make the investment in hiring a new worker or expanding your wage base, you\'ll benefit from the tax cut that the President is pushing Congress to pass this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the argument, though, is the tiny small businesses are not hiring.\xc2\xa0 What we don\'t really want to think of is a small business concern with a thousand workers -- they are.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure what the point of your question is.\xc2\xa0 Again, 97.3 percent, 97 percent of small businesses unaffected.\xc2\xa0 By the Republican definition of a small business, the hedge fund managers would get a big tax cut, law partners would get a big tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But also a concern, a manufacturing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to cite me real examples, instead of hypothetical ones, and perhaps there are.\xc2\xa0 But those businesses would benefit not just from, if they file this way, from a tax cut for the first $250,000, but from every other tax cut that the President has passed into law -- 18 and counting -- and from a tax -- and when you talk about hiring, that\'s why Congress ought to pass the provision the President supports -- actually initiated -- that would reward small businesses if they hire more.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A company with a thousand workers, $250,000 tax cut means nothing to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, you\'re talking about a hypothetical that I don\'t even know if it exists.\xc2\xa0 If you want to come to me with -- or come to our economists with an example of a company with a thousand workers that files on personal income tax -- files under the personal income, is an S corps -- because we\'re talking -- I think you may be confused here with the corporate tax rate here and the individual tax rate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the SBA\'s definition of a small business, which for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, the issue is how do they file their taxes.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re talking about personal income tax rates.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about extending tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, individuals, and how they file.\xc2\xa0 The issue -- the canard the Republicans put out there is that a lot of small businesses file as S corps, I believe it\'s called, and under the individual income tax code, 97 percent of them would not be affected by this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark Landler of The New York Times.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You addressed the issue of sequesters earlier, but I wanted to put it in a different context.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow the President is going to Virginia, a state that\'s economically dependent on military contracts.\xc2\xa0 What should or will the President say to people in Hampton Roads and that area who don\'t understand the ins and outs and mysteries of sequesters; all they know is what they\'re hearing, which is that next year they could face these devastating cuts in military contracts -- what message would the President have for those people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you would make clear that what he supports, what he signed into law, what bipartisan majorities of both parties passed last year, was a legislative commitment by Congress to take action to avoid the sequester.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense, the President and others have made clear they do not support cuts in defense spending that would be called for in the sequester, as well as the President made clear cuts in non-defense in spending that\xe2\x80\x99s called for in the sequester.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cuts were -- the across-the-board cuts were objectionable and onerous to both sides for a reason.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why Congress has to act.\xc2\xa0 And I think for defense industries and others, that there is -- for everybody who cares about this issue, and everybody should, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of why we need to -- we, the American people, need to remind Congress that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to compromise and take a balanced approach here; that it is not the right policy to balance our -- or get our fiscal house in order and deal with our deficits and debt by asking only senior citizens, only the middle class, only parents with children with disabilities to bear the burden.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what the bottom line is.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that has been the stoppage, the stalemate, that\xe2\x80\x99s been created by the Republican insistence that there be no revenues as part of a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s unsustainable.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, the President believes, we will get that balanced approach because it is what the American people support and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought there might be one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President\xe2\x80\x99s message for the last two or three trips outside of Washington has been, let\xe2\x80\x99s give the middle class some certainty, let\xe2\x80\x99s give them a tax cut.\xc2\xa0 So the certainty in a time of economic uneasiness is a key part of his message.\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s going to Virginia and saying, on the one hand, I want to give you certainty, but on the other hand, I can give you no certainty on a key component of your local economy, which is the military contracting business.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of complicate his message?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- he can\xe2\x80\x99t give -- I mean, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 Congress passed a law.\xc2\xa0 The point he\xe2\x80\x99s making with extending the middle-class tax cuts is that here is something, amidst all this stalemate, that Democrats and Republicans all agree we should do, which is extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people -- American taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 So amidst -- this is the little diamond in the sand, right, that let\xe2\x80\x99s do that, we all agree on it, let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s create -- and that does create an important amount of economic certainty not just for the recipients of that tax cut but for the broader economy.\xc2\xa0 It addresses a portion of the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it now.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s continue to debate the issues where we -- where there is contention and disagreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is not the answer to simply say, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it -- we, Congress -- when we signed this into law.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, the point is Congress needs to make some tough choices and deal with our deficit and debt in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And if the answer is, well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to do that after all, then that takes away the very purpose of the sequester, which was to force Congress to make some tough calls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not saying with the same urgency, let\xe2\x80\x99s deal with the sequester issue now, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this settled now before we get to January, that he\xe2\x80\x99s saying the tax cuts, which -- so are you at all worried that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying "this week." I mean, the President has been talking about the urgency to deal with our deficit and debt in a balanced way all year.\xc2\xa0 And last fall -- it is embodied in his several budget proposals, and embodied -- he talked about it in the State of the Union, he talked about it in his budget proposal, he talked about it all spring -- winter and spring.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hear him talk about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was disappointing that the super committee didn\xe2\x80\x99t get its act together, that Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 It was disappointing that an unelected person who passes out petitions seems to have more power and authority in Congress with the Republican Party than its leaders.\xc2\xa0 But we need to break that logjam so that that balanced approach is adopted to create the kind of foundation for future economic growth that the President believes we need to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry -- it\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:54 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
