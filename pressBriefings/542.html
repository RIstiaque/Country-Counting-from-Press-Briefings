EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. TROTTER:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for hopping on and joining us to talk about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today with the Prime Minister of Georgia and his upcoming meetings the President of Switzerland and the Prime Minister of Moldova.</p>\n<p class="p2">Our speakers today, who you can quote as senior administration officials, will get us started with some background information about these meetings, and then we will take some of your questions.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s limit it to one question per person.</p>\n<p class="p3">And with that, I will let our first speaker get started.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today.\xc2\xa0 A little while ago the Vice President finished a meeting with Georgian Prime Minister Garibashvili, a meeting that President Obama joined for a portion, where both the President and the Vice President reaffirmed America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and made clear that the U.S. has a profound interest in Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s success.</p>\n<p class="p2">After the 2012 parliamentary elections, and the 2013 presidential elections, Georgia has completed its first peaceful democratic transfer of power, a historic achievement for Georgia and for the region as a whole.</p>\n<p class="p2">And this was the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to Washington.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s only been in office for just a few months, but we wanted to be able to engage the new government early on to demonstrate our strong commitment not just to the new government, but to the people of Georgia and to Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s continued democratic development and economic progress.</p>\n<p class="p2">The Vice President and the President spoke to Prime Minister Garibashvili about Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s role as a valued partner to NATO in Afghanistan, and made clear that a Georgia that\'s working towards peace and stability, that has strong democratic institutions and rule of law and that is growing economically can have a positive influence in the region and beyond.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to support all of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s political and party leaders and Georgian civil society as they work to consolidate Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s democratic achievements.</p>\n<p class="p2">Next Monday, the Vice President will also be meeting with Moldovan Prime Minister Lean\xc4\x8da.\xc2\xa0 The Moldovan government is also new.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in office for less than a year, and face their own challenges from working towards a comprehensive settlement to end the frozen conflict on its territory, to continuing the hard work of building a modern and democratic state.</p>\n<p class="p2">Moldova also has the strong and steadfast support of the United States as it undertakes these challenges, which the Vice President will stress just as he did when he visited Moldova back in 2011.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The United States would also like to see a comprehensive settlement to the Transnistria Conflict and gives our full support to the OSCE \xe2\x80\x9c5-plus-2\xe2\x80\x9d negotiations, the next round of which will take place in Vienna later this week, and which the Vice President will discuss with the Prime Minister when he\xe2\x80\x99s here next Monday.</p>\n<p class="p2">The fact that Moldova also initialed an association agreement with the EU in November represents a choice the Moldovan people have made to move their country forward, and we support that choice to pursue European integration.\xc2\xa0 The association agreement includes a free trade agreement, which when signed and ratified will offer Moldova significant economic opportunity through greater access to one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest markets.\xc2\xa0 And that won\xe2\x80\x99t just benefit Moldova but the region as a whole.</p>\n<p class="p2">In addition to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings with the Georgian and Moldovan leaders, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also have the opportunity to confer with Swiss President and Chairperson in Office of the OSCE, President Burkhalter, of Switzerland.</p>\n<p class="p2">We have a strong and important friendship with the Swiss that spans a whole range of regional and global issues.\xc2\xa0 The Swiss protect U.S. interests in Iran and Cuba and are working with us on everything from global health security to nonproliferation to development.\xc2\xa0 And some of you may know that President Burkhalter is in Washington to testify before the U.S. Helsinki Commission, and we\xe2\x80\x99re glad to have the opportunity to speak with him under both of his capacities.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, obviously this comes at an important time for the administration because it gives us the chance to compare notes with the OSCE on potential steps that the international community can take to help Ukrainian leaders deal with the some of the immediate and pressing challenges they face.\xc2\xa0 And the OSCE in particular can offer assistance and expertise to lawmakers as they attempt to put together a new multi-party, unity government that can take the country forward in this difficult time.</p>\n<p class="p2">We also believe that the Swiss chairmanship of the OSCE can be a positive force for progress through its roles as a mediator in the OSCE \xe2\x80\x9c5-plus-2\xe2\x80\x9d talks with Moldova, and as co-chair of the international Geneva discussions on Georgia, so this visit is particularly well timed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, while we did not plan it this way, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many of you have noticed that these discussions are taking place against the backdrop of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden has been deeply engaged, including nine phone calls over the course of the last several months to President Yanukovych, and meetings here in Washington with Ukrainian religious leaders.\xc2\xa0 And his interventions at key moments have been designed to urge an immediate end to the use of violence and concrete steps forward toward compromise.</p>\n<p class="p2">Let me just close with a couple of words about Russia.\xc2\xa0 Our support for Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine is not part of some zero-sum game with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Our engagement rather is aimed at supporting the people of these countries as they seek to fulfill their aspirations and make their own choices about their countries\xe2\x80\x99 economic and political futures.\xc2\xa0 Now they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen a European path, but we do not believe that the decision of these countries to pursue a European path should preclude them from having productive relations with Moscow, a point that we have made to Russian counterparts up and down the chain of command.</p>\n<p class="p2">So with that, let me open it up to questions that I and my colleagues will do our best to answer.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, it\xe2\x80\x99s Margaret Talev with Bloomberg.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail about how you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping the conversations with these three countries can help, even with stability in Ukraine or with stability in these countries, and whether you also expect President Obama to pop in on the upcoming two meetings.\xc2\xa0 If you can give us any detail about how long he participated in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting and what he actually said.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 With respect to today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, the President joined for about 20 minutes and had the opportunity to first congratulate the Prime Minister for Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s success in completing its first peaceful, democratic transition of power.\xc2\xa0 And then he urged both the Prime Minister and his delegation to continue working with all of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and with Georgian civil society to advance the rule of law and to consolidate the democratic achievements that they made so far.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President and the Prime Minister discussed Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s role in Afghanistan, where the President thanked the Georgian Prime Minister for the sacrifices that Georgian soldiers have made as the largest non-NATO contributor to the ISAF mission.\xc2\xa0 And they talked about steps, concrete steps that both countries could take to increase trade and commercial ties, particularly to the benefit of the Georgian economy as it grapples with some economic challenges and challenging economic reforms.</p>\n<p class="p2">We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that the President will drop in on the meeting with President Burkhalter or with Prime Minister Lean\xc4\x8da.</p>\n<p class="p3">In terms of how these meetings can help the countries of the region -- Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- I think many of the comments I made in the opening speak directly to that.\xc2\xa0 For starters, being able at high levels to communicate the United States\xe2\x80\x99 strong support for Georgia and Moldova, both in their efforts to take political, economic and security reforms at home, to resolve difficult conflicts, and to advance along the European path, and then to talk practically about the ways in which the United States can help support that will, I think, result in improved prospects for both of those countries.</p>\n<p class="p3">For example, with Moldova, we have provided a five-year, $262-million Millennium Challenge compact that is supporting Moldova\xe2\x80\x99s economy by rehabilitating infrastructure and providing technical assistance and access to finance to farmers in agri-business.\xc2\xa0 And, with Georgia, the Prime Minister will also have the opportunity to sit down with Trade Representative Froman to talk about how we can carry our economic relationship forward.</p>\n<p class="p3">And then, with respect to Ukraine, the OSCE we believe has a practical role to play in working to help bring about the kind of multi-party unity government to carry Ukraine forward.\xc2\xa0 And so consultations between the Vice President and President Burkhalter can help shape that agenda.</p>\n<p class="p3">And then I would just close by saying that the Vice President has a longstanding interest in and passion for this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 And his personal relationships, those that he has built over many years and new ones that he is developing with new leaders in these countries, can go a long way towards helping create the kind of trust and platform for cooperation that will serve the interests of the United States and these countries.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned how this was not going to be a zero-sum game with Russia at the outset, but I wonder kind of -- I know you can say that, but the fact is that all of these kind of Western actions have been interpreted as such.\xc2\xa0 If you look to NATO expansion and so on, and so on forth, those have been interpreted as threatening to Russia.\xc2\xa0 And kind of how do you get around it if it\xe2\x80\x99s constantly being interpreted in that way?\xc2\xa0 And just -- yes, so that\xe2\x80\x99s my question.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me start and I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask my colleagues if they\xe2\x80\x99d like to add.\xc2\xa0 The most salient actions are not Western actions, they\xe2\x80\x99re the actions of the people of these countries.</p>\n<p class="p3">As I noted in my opening comments, Moldova and Georgia have both chosen to take steps along the path of Euro-Atlantic integration with association agreements.\xc2\xa0 The people of Ukraine obviously have made their voices heard loud and clear about the kind of future that they are looking for.\xc2\xa0 So the position of the United States has been consistent and clear that we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that any country -- the United States, any European country, or Russia -- can dictate the future of these nations in Eastern Europe and the Caucuses.\xc2\xa0 It is up for the people of these countries through the democratic process to make their own decisions.\xc2\xa0 And we are watching unfold in Ukraine today in very vivid terms but also in both Georgia and Moldova that set of choices.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">As I said also at the outset, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this is zero-sum, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not just something that we say publically, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we say in intensive consultations with the Russians -- that a European path is not in any way inconsistent with productive relationships between these countries and Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the stability and prosperity of the region will be best served if these countries pursue the European integration they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen and at the same time build stable and constructive relations with Russia moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if my colleagues have anything to add to that.</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I would just add that integration in the international economy and cooperation with international security organizations is something we want for Russia as well, and is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We supported Russia\xe2\x80\x99s WTO accession.\xc2\xa0 We support Russia\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation within the OSCE and with NATO, so this is part of our understanding of how countries do well and how they serve their citizens well.\xc2\xa0 And we would want that for Russia as much as we want it for the countries that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about earlier today.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, this is Lara Jakes with the AP.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, as you talk to the Georgian Prime Minister and you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there have been many talks with the Moldovans as well -- these are two nations that have gone through much of what, although not to the extent maybe what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Kyiv right now.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just kind of wondering what advice the Georgian Prime Minister gave to the Vice President in terms of how the United States can help Ukraine as it goes through the transition.</p>\n<p class="p2">And related to that, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can shed a little bit of light on what kind of aid package the U.S. might be willing to supplement whatever the IMF is proposing, and what kind of parameters in terms of dollar values we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the advice that the Prime Minister shared with the Vice President, I think he mainly focused on what we was hoping the United States would do in terms of its support to Georgia.\xc2\xa0 But, of course, that is applicable to other countries in the region as well.\xc2\xa0 And that is to extend and expand as much as possible our own commercial ties with Georgia, and at the same time work closely with our European partners to help complete the path of European integration.\xc2\xa0 And that means moving from signing the association agreement -- or excuse me, initialing the association agreement with the European Union to ultimately signing it and pursuing a deep and comprehensive free-trade agreement.</p>\n<p class="p2">And then, also, the importance of visits like this and personal connections like this to show the strong support that the United States has for shared values -- values of democratic development and open economies, and self-determination.\xc2\xa0 And then for the United States also to stand up and be clear about our position, our very strong position on support for Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.</p>\n<p class="p2">So he didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer specific advice vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 He was much more focused on the bilateral relationship between the United States and Georgia, and Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s European aspirations.\xc2\xa0 But, of course, the conversation comes against the backdrop of what is happening in Ukraine, and many of the same lessons apply.</p>\n<p class="p2">In terms of the package under discussion -- I always hate to punt on these kinds of things, but I would like to kick you to Treasury for the real details on it.\xc2\xa0 However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleague to talk through a little bit about what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to accomplish through economic support to Ukraine at this time.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Certainly, one of the big challenges facing Ukraine is its economic situation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been having discussions over the weekend with counterparts in Kyiv about a commitment on the part of the incoming Ukrainian government to economic reforms that would then unlock IMF financing for Ukraine and help return Ukraine to economic health.</p>\n<p class="p3">The idea behind the package that the United States and European partners and others have been discussing would be to complement that IMF financing, the idea being that we understand the reforms that the Ukrainians will have to put in place are very difficult and the extent to which we can ease some of what goes along with those reforms is the aim of that complementary package.</p>\n<p class="p3">And Secretary Lew is, as you know, that aware, was at G20 meetings over the weekend, where he was able to discuss this with that set of international partners and we will be continuing to do so.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re just not in a position today to talk about specific dollar figures, but we recognize that the needs of the Ukrainian economy over the next two years are substantial and between the IMF and other efforts to work with a Ukraine that is pursuing these kinds of reforms, we believe that the will is there in the international community to meet those needs.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this thing is still on or the mic is still open -- but is it fair to assume that whatever IMF package that is put together, supplemented by the U.S., that probably is not going to reach the $15 billion amount that Russia had promised the Ukraine some time ago?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I do not agree with that judgment.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the IMF has actually the capacity to certainly loan Ukraine whatever the amount is that Ukraine needs.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any concern that an IMF package could not meet whatever the economic needs are of Ukraine, and I think if you look at past negotiations that Ukraine has had with the IMF, they have been around that $15 billion number.\xc2\xa0 But, again, because Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s economic situation has changed over the course of this year, the IMF would do a new assessment.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly poised to meet whatever those financing needs are.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is, what challenges domestically and internationally does the U.S. administration foresee for Georgia as it proceeds with consolidating its democratic aid?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take this opportunity to make that the last question, a very good question.</p>\n<p class="p3">Well, first let me start by saying that we see more opportunities in some ways than challenges because of the successful transfer -- peaceful, democratic transfer of power.\xc2\xa0 It puts Georgia in a position to really deliver for its citizens and to allow them to live up to their potential.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t substantial challenges relating to strengthening the rule of law and relating to making the kinds of economic reforms and economic choices that are required for a sustainable economic future.\xc2\xa0 And really in those two areas -- deepening Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s democracy and modernizing and strengthening Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s economy -- we are mindful of the difficult choices and decisions that are going to face the Prime Minister and his government.\xc2\xa0 And those were the subject of intense conversation today between the Vice President and the President and with the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p class="p2">But we believe that with good will and a strong commitment by all of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, the Georgian private sector, Georgian civil society, that they have the wherewithal to meet those challenges.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if my colleagues want to add anything to that.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. TROTTER:\xc2\xa0 Well, that will be it for us.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everyone.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n4:53 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
