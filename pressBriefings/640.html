Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here, as ever.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top of this briefing, so I will go straight to Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Has the President made any decision in the last 24 hours or so on what the U.S. response to the Syrian chemical weapons attack would be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President continues to work with his national security team reviewing the options available to him.\xc2\xa0 And when he has made a decision and has an announcement to make he\'ll make it.\xc2\xa0 So that process continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he has not made a decision at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of speculation that this intelligence report that presumably would link Assad directly to the chemical weapons attack might be released today.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on the timing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that yesterday I made clear that the intelligence community is working on an assessment and that once we had that assessment we would provide information to the public about it in the coming days.\xc2\xa0 And that remains true.\xc2\xa0 I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s speculation that it would come today rather than some other day.\xc2\xa0 But it will come and I think you can expect it this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me also say, and I think that both Secretary Kerry and I attempted to make clear yesterday that there is no doubt here that chemical weapons were used on a massive scale on August 21st outside of Damascus.\xc2\xa0 There is also very little doubt, and should be no doubt for anyone who approaches this logically, that the Syrian regime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons on August 21st outside of Damascus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have established with a high degree of confidence that the Syria regime has used chemical weapons already in this conflict.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that it is our firm assessment that the Syrian regime has maintained control of the stockpile of chemical weapons in Syria throughout this conflict.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case that the Syrian regime has the rocket capacity to deliver the chemical weapons as they were delivered with repugnant results on August 21st outside of Damascus.</p>\n<p>So the deliberations that are taking place now and the options that are being considered by the President and his national security team are not around the question of whether or not chemical weapons were used in Syria on a significant scale, causing mass death and injury to innocent civilians -- to women and children.\xc2\xa0 It is not around the question of whether or not the Syrian regime is responsible.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s around the question of what is the appropriate response to this clear violation of international norms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s your expectation the intel report -- that it will provide some type of evidence that clearly shows, beyond sort of taking all of these pieces that we know and inferring that this must be the Assad regime -- will this be tangible evidence --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There will be more information provided with what we can give to you in an unclassified manner to the public from the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 But this is not just an inference.\xc2\xa0 This is not just the U.S. government asserting it.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw the statement from the Arab League.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen multiple eyewitness accounts, video accounts.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements from independent organizations working in Syria, like Doctors Without Borders.\xc2\xa0 Some of your colleagues who are risking their lives to cover this story in Syria have provided substantial confirmation of what occurred on August 21st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President is engaged in is a process of deciding, as he consults with international allies and as his administration consults with Congress, about what the appropriate response to this flagrant violation of international norms should be.\xc2\xa0 And there must be a response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, British Prime Minister David Cameron is recalling Parliament this week.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a motion put forward on Thursday, a vote on authorizing the British response.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that President Obama is not going to recall Congress to seek some type of similar measure before proceeding?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to engage in speculation about a course of action that has not been decided upon.\xc2\xa0 When the President has an announcement to make, he\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.\xc2\xa0 As this process is undertaken, we are consulting directly with House and Senate leaders in Congress.\xc2\xa0 We are consulting directly with the leadership of the relevant committees as well as with other members of Congress who have a keen interest in this matter.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that documented by some members who have spoken to it.\xc2\xa0 And that process will continue.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the consultation process take place in a matter like this of such gravity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are also, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, engaging with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial list of communications that the Secretary of State has had.\xc2\xa0 The President himself, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out to you, has had consultations with Canadian Prime Minister Harper today, and in recent days with British Prime Minister Cameron, French President Hollande, and Australian Prime Minister Rudd.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that the President will continue to make calls to his counterparts throughout the week.</p>\n<p>When it comes to processes -- I think which goes to your question -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- it presupposes a course of action that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been decided upon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that fact that Cameron is in a position to recall his Parliament, says he\xe2\x80\x99s going to put forward a motion on Thursday, seems to suggest that there is something that\'s been decided.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just make a broad statement.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is a different country with a different form of government.\xc2\xa0 There is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about whether something has been decided.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s in a position to take this step on Thursday seems to indicate something has been decided.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, nothing has been decided, as I said in response to your first question.\xc2\xa0 We are in direct contact with Prime Minister Cameron and his government, and the President himself has spoken with the Prime Minister, as he has with other foreign leaders, and those consultations will continue.\xc2\xa0 And we share the views of the British government about the appalling nature of the transgression that occurred in Syria, and are consulting with the British and other allies and partners about the appropriate response.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you were very firm in saying just now that there\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that the Syrian regime was, in fact, responsible for this chemical attack.\xc2\xa0 So in that context, what is the purpose of this intelligence report?\xc2\xa0 Is it to legitimize -- to get rid of any remaining doubt and, therefore, legitimize a response in the eyes of the international community?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any doubt that exists.\xc2\xa0 I think that maybe if you take Bashar al-Assad seriously on these matters you might have some doubt.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no evidence to suggest that he has any credibility when it comes to his statements about the use of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The actions taken by his regime in response to in the immediate aftermath of this heinous attack demonstrate his lack of credibility.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that a careful review of the facts leads to the conclusion that the regime was behind this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, it\'s undeniable that chemical weapons were used on a large scale.\xc2\xa0 We know that the regime maintains custody of the chemical weapons in Syria and uses the types of rockets that were used to deliver chemical weapons on August 21.\xc2\xa0 The opposition does not.\xc2\xa0 We also know that the opposition does not have the capabilities that the Syrian regime has.\xc2\xa0 And, as I mentioned earlier, we have already had an assessment by the intelligence community with a high degree of confidence that the Syrian regime has used on a smaller scale chemical weapons in this conflict already.\xc2\xa0 So suggestions that there\'s any doubt about who is responsible for this are as preposterous as suggestions that the attack itself didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel said, I guess it was yesterday, that any actions taken would be in concert with the international community and within the framework of legal justification.\xc2\xa0 Is any legal justification lacking prior to any action by the United States on this?\xc2\xa0 And does the international community need any further convincing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to make legal justifications for actions that haven\'t been decided upon.\xc2\xa0 When the President makes a decision about what the appropriate response for the United States is, we will and he will provide ample context for the decision that he makes.\xc2\xa0 But prior to that, I\'m not going to speculate about what that context will be because an announcement has not been made and a decision is pending, as the President and his team review the options available to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the United States yesterday postponed with Russia talks in The Hague.\xc2\xa0 Russia calls that regrettable.\xc2\xa0 What is the United States trying to say or communicate to Russia about Syria -- that it should accept a military response; that it should not stand in the way or object?\xc2\xa0 What are we trying to communicate to Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the meeting that you mentioned has been postponed, not cancelled.\xc2\xa0 We are very engaged in the process of pursuing a political resolution to this conflict.\xc2\xa0 We have stated for a long time that there is no military solution available here; that the way to bring about a better future in Syria is through negotiation and a political resolution.\xc2\xa0 And it is our firm belief that Bashar al-Assad has long since forsaken any legitimacy that he might have to lead, and that Syria\'s future must be one that is without Assad in power.\xc2\xa0 But that is a process that has to take place through negotiation.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to engage in all of the many ways that we have in an effort to bring about that reconciliation -- or that process, that settlement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what we are focused on this week, obviously, is the response to a specific violation of international norms.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s important -- I was asked about this yesterday and I think it\'s important to look at what we\'re talking about when we talk about international norms.\xc2\xa0 The effort to deal with the scourge of chemical weapons has been undertaken at an international level since the mid-19th century, and in particular, since the end of World War I, when forces on both sides of that conflict engaged in the horrific use of poison gas.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Chemical Weapons Convention has more than 150 signatories and makes clear that the use and proliferation of chemical weapons is a clear violation of international norms, and that it is absolutely in the national security interest of the Unites States and in the international community that the use of chemical weapons on the scale that we saw on August 21st cannot be ignored.\xc2\xa0 It must be responded to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because to allow it to happen without a response would be to invite further use of chemical weapons and to have that international standard dissolve.\xc2\xa0 And the consequences of that, given the volatility of the region and the concerns that this nation and many others have about proliferation of chemical weapons, would be very serious indeed.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to say that there are word games going on here, but you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there will be -- I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely not saying that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re saying that there will be a response, but the President has not made a decision yet.\xc2\xa0 It is safe to say, though, at this point that the Syrian government will pay a price for what has happened?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There must be a response.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry made that clear, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s instruction, yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I echoed that here yesterday, and I\xe2\x80\x99m echoing it again today.\xc2\xa0 There must be a response.\xc2\xa0 We cannot allow this kind of violation of an international norm with all the attendant grave consequences that it represents to go unanswered.\xc2\xa0 What form that response will take is what the President is assessing now with his team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as the President weighs his options, does he want to take out Assad?\xc2\xa0 And would his death be a welcomed outcome at this White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change.\xc2\xa0 They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>We are also very much engaged in an effort to support the opposition in its struggle with the Assad regime as the Assad regime continues to try to massacre its own people in an effort to maintain power.\xc2\xa0 And it is our firm conviction that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future cannot include Assad in power.</p>\n<p>But this deliberation and the actions that we are contemplating are not about regime change.\xc2\xa0 We believe, as I said earlier in answer to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, that resolution of this conflict has to come through political negotiation and settlement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And because so much blood and treasure has been spilled and spent in both Afghanistan and Iraq, if some sort of military action will be taken -- obviously the President will be talking about that to the American people -- but how much should the American people expect, prepare themselves for, in terms of sacrifices being made by people inside the armed forces?\xc2\xa0 And are there cost estimates being put together in terms of how much this is going to cost?\xc2\xa0 And will it run us up against that debt ceiling sooner than expected?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All excellent questions, most of them assuming a decision has been made, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sort of speculate about a decision that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been made yet.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of those questions we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly take once the President has announced the course of action that he\xe2\x80\x99s chosen,\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the President has made clear that he does not envision a situation in Syria that would lead to U.S. boots on the ground, and that remains the case.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve also tried to make clear that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can have boots in the air.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to see that.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Theoretically speaking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Theoretically speaking.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President has been clear about that, Jim.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that applies generally to the Syrian conflict, but also specifically to the responses contemplated here with regards to the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just so I\'m clear, the White House has decided that there must be a response.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that there must be a military response?\xc2\xa0 Or are there other things possible still on the agenda?\xc2\xa0 Could it be further sanctions, or economic in any way, or is this a military response you\'re talking about?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say two things.\xc2\xa0 First, we have made clear for a long time, notwithstanding our views about the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t envision U.S. boots on the ground in Syria, that we retain -- and the President retains all options available to him in Syria, and that includes military options.\xc2\xa0 And that is the case here in response to this transgression.</p>\n<p>But a decision about the use of military force has not been made.\xc2\xa0 The President is reviewing his options -- plural.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, his options are many and they include a variety of possibilities that are not limited to the use of force.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing I wanted to ask you about, and that is on the -- you say that the reason why the United States has come to the decision that the Syrian government was responsible for this attack was because they have the rockets to deliver it. And there\'s no evidence that they -- are we sure there\'s no evidence that they have lost any control of any stockpiles of chemical weapons?\xc2\xa0 Is our intelligence that there\'s not been a chemical depot somewhere that\'s been overrun by al Qaeda forces or other rebels in that country?\xc2\xa0 Do we know that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have a high degree of confidence, based on our assessments, that the Syrian regime has maintained full control of its chemical weapons stockpiles throughout this conflict.\xc2\xa0 It is our conviction that the Syrian regime has the rocket capability that was employed to devastating effect in this chemical weapons attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is abundantly obvious to those who have covered this conflict, who were covering it last week, to the international organizations present on the ground, that the Syrian regime was engaged in an effort to clear these particular regions of opposition forces with violent force prior to the use of chemical weapons and, in the immediate aftermath of the use of chemical weapons, prevented the U.N. inspections team from going in to establish that weapons had been used as they continued to bombard the neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 And they continued to do that yesterday after the U.N. inspection team, finally, after being attacked, was able to make it to one area that they needed to visit.\xc2\xa0 After they left they continued to bombard the area, which is a clear effort to try to dispose of evidence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, just one more if I could, and that is, if the aim here is to make sure or to punish the Syrian government for using chemical weapons and to discourage them from using them again, there are those who argue that the best way to do that is, in fact, to take out Assad and to have regime change.\xc2\xa0 What is the argument against that from the White House, from those who are calling for --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I noted earlier, the options that are being considered do not contain within them a regime change focus, and that is not what we are contemplating here.\xc2\xa0 We are examining options to respond to this violation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as I tried to say yesterday, this is obviously a terrible conflict that has exacted a horrific price on the Syrian people and the region, and it is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And we have stepped up our support for the opposition and our humanitarian support for the Syrian people and for the countries that are dealing with the refugee crisis related to the Syrian conflict.</p>\n<p>The use of chemical weapons on the scale that we saw is a separate and distinct fact that needs to be responded to, and it will be responded to in some form.\xc2\xa0 Because the President believes, and many of our allies and partners clearly believe, and as I stated earlier and I understated the number of nations who have participated in the Chemical Weapons Convention -- it\xe2\x80\x99s 189 nations representing about 98 percent of the global population -- all have a stake in ensuring that that international norm is maintained and respected.\xc2\xa0 And so a clear violation of it, a flagrant violation of it, that has resulted in mass death, the killing of innocent women and children, has to be responded to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand that, Jay.\xc2\xa0 But what my question is, what is the response as to -- if the way to do this, as some say is, and prevent it from happening again is to take out the guy who\xe2\x80\x99s doing it, what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that?\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is not our position -- it is not our policy position to respond to this through regime change.\xc2\xa0 We will take an appropriate response, and we are evaluating -- the President and his team are evaluating the options available to them.\xc2\xa0 And the President will make an assessment and an announcement in due time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also maintain a policy with regards to the conflict which has us providing significant support to the opposition, significant humanitarian support to the Syrian people that is designed to help bring about a transition in Syria, a political transition, that will allow Syria the future that its people deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re answering why you ruled it out.\xc2\xa0 The why is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is not our policy to respond to this transgression to a regime change.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it necessary for the United Nations to arbitrate this international violation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the United Nations has an interest in this.\xc2\xa0 They have an inspection team in.\xc2\xa0 They and others have made clear that the mandate of that inspection team is to establish whether or not chemical weapons were used.\xc2\xa0 That has absolutely and undeniably already been established.\xc2\xa0 They are not assigned the responsibility of assigning culpability.\xc2\xa0 So the work of that team is redundant, you might say, because it is clearly established already that chemical weapons have been used on a significant scale.</p>\n<p>We are engaged in international consultations.\xc2\xa0 And we have not decided upon what course of action the United States will take, and therefore it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to talk about the context and the means of moving forward once a decision has been made.\xc2\xa0 Once we have something to announce we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide the context around it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily required, from the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, that the United Nations and the Security Council be the one to say, yes, an international violation has occurred and therefore something must be done in response?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, and I don\'t see anyone contradicting it -- anybody with any credibility in the world -- that chemical weapons were used on a significant scale in Syria, so the transgression is established.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, we will have more to say once a decision has been made about the response that will be taken.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that it is in the clear national security interest of the United States that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons on this scale not go unanswered.\xc2\xa0 The consequences of a dissolution of that norm would be profoundly not in the interest of the United States or in the international community, in particular in this highly volatile region, but also around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the volatility of the region.\xc2\xa0 Syria said if there is an attack, there might be a response directed at Israel.\xc2\xa0 Israel has said it will respond forcefully to anything that comes its way from Syria.\xc2\xa0 Among the risks, which are many, involved in this, how concerned is the President and the White House about this not becoming just a Syrian problem but a wider regional problem if, in fact, there is a military response that has a coalition of not just the United States but Britain, France and others?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about decisions that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been made, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say when an announcement is forthcoming.</p>\n<p>I would note that the Syrian conflict has already had profound negative conflict -- consequences to other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 I would note also that when we talk about the instability in the region and the volatility in the region that Syria borders an ally -- a NATO ally of the United States in Turkey, and a close friend and partner of the United States in Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And both of those nations have felt significant consequences as a result of this conflict and have a great deal at stake when we talk about the use and proliferation of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>So, again, I\'m not going to go down the road of making justifications for actions that have not been decided upon.\xc2\xa0 I urge you to wait until we have an announcement to make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is one of the reasons not to seek regime change and to have something that is being described as singular and responsive to chemical weapons and therefore of shorter duration and likelihood to avoid the spillover effects that might occur if there was a more sustained military campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s all sorts of hypotheticals we could engage in about decisions that haven\'t been made, and they\'re all substantive and interesting.\xc2\xa0 But I think that before we go down that road, I want to make clear that the President is engaged in a process of reviewing his options in response to the undeniable use of chemical weapons and our conviction that those weapons were used by the regime.\xc2\xa0 And not just our conviction; I would point you to the statement today by the Arab League, which was very forceful, as well as by Prime Minister Cameron and others.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congresswoman Barbara Lee -- you\'ll remember she was the only member of Congress to vote against the war in Afghanistan after 9/11 -- she said today she agrees with you that chemical weapons were used, that it\'s troubling, it\'s unacceptable, but she said there\'s no military solution in Syria. And so she said, "Congress needs to have a full debate before the U.S. commits to any military force."\xc2\xa0 Do you disagree?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I made clear I think, in answer to other questions, that we completely agree that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria, that there has to be a political transition.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged in a process with many countries as well as with the opposition to help bring about that transition.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, as Assad continues to brutally assault and murder his own people, we have provided assistance and stepped up assistance to the military opposition in Syria as we help the opposition itself unify.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should Congress have a full debate on whether or not military force would be used?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are engaging in what we believe our responsibility is here, which is to consult with Congress -- that process is underway -- about what happened --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Authorize -- not consult, but authorize force.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re asking me to speculate about courses of action --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This discussion has to happen before military force is used --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said -- you\'re talking about courses of action based on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is not considering military action?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s considering military action, so why not have a debate in Congress about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the right way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congress can have the debate.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is you\'re asking me about what Congress should do if the President makes a certain decision.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'ve made clear repeatedly, both yesterday and today, is that the President is reviewing his options with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 We have never taken military force off the table and we will not now in response to this flagrant violation of international norms.\xc2\xa0 And when we have an announcement to make, we\'ll make it.\xc2\xa0 And we will provide all the necessary context about the response that we\'ve decided upon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 2007, the Boston Globe asked candidates running for president to answer a series of written questions, and one was in the context of Iran:\xc2\xa0 Does the President have the constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use of force authorization from Congress?\xc2\xa0 Candidate Obama said, "The President does not have the power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation." Does the President still agree with that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re also trying to get me to engage in a discussion about a decision that has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not a hypothetical anymore.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a hypothetical, Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have to admit the military option has been on the table for a year, a year and a half.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now it\'s not about hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 We are maybe within days, if not hours, of the President making a decision, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is correct that the President is working with his national security team reviewing the options available to him to respond to the clear violation of an international norm by the Syrian regime with the use of, on a significant scale, chemical weapons against innocent civilians, A.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>B, as I made clear, it is clearly in the United States\' national security interests that that norm be maintained because the consequences of that standard dissolving are enormous and very detrimental to the interest of the United States and very detrimental to the international community, to our allies and partners in the region, and to the world at large.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re saying that\'s the standard today.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m saying the standard in 2007 to candidate Obama was an actual or imminent threat to the nation.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that exists right now, an actual imminent threat to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that absolutely allowing the use of chemical weapons on a significant scale to take place without a response would present a significant challenge to or threat to the United States\' national security interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not just to our allies in the region, but to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to be clear on the role that the U.N. investigators are playing.\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday during the briefing that you do not have confidence the U.N. can conduct a credible inquiry into what happened.\xc2\xa0 So does that mean that their findings won\'t play a role in President Obama\'s ultimate decision?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The mandate of the inspection team is to establish whether or not chemical weapons were used.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been established incontrovertibly, undeniably.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody in this room, anybody who is covering it, any international organization that\'s there, or any nation that I\'m aware of outside the Syrian regime has made an assertion to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President need to wait for them to come to their ultimate conclusion before making a decision?\xc2\xa0 Will he?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is the issue of were chemical weapons used; that is what the United Nations inspection team is mandated to discover.\xc2\xa0 Since that has been already discovered, I\'m not sure that they need to fulfill their mandate.\xc2\xa0 But as I say that, I want to be clear, as I was yesterday, that this country, this administration has been a strong proponent of the U.N. inspection team and having it provided all the necessary access to establish whether or not chemical weapons have been used.\xc2\xa0 And of course, Assad has blocked that repeatedly.</p>\n<p>And even in this case, where they said in the initial aftermath of the attack that they welcomed an inspection team, they then blocked -- even though the inspection team was 45 minutes way -- they blocked access for four or five -- for five days, as they bombarded the neighborhoods to try to eliminate the evidence of chemical weapons use.</p>\n<p>So the credibility of the Assad regime here is obviously close to zero.\xc2\xa0 The use of chemical weapons on a significant scale is undeniable, and so the mandate has been fulfilled in many ways.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, they could be there until Sunday. President Obama could make a decision before Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in hypotheticals about when decisions are going to be made, when courses of action may be engaged in.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say, as Secretary Kerry did yesterday, that the violation is undeniable.\xc2\xa0 It is our firm conviction that the Assad regime is responsible.\xc2\xa0 Logic dictates that conclusion, as well as the hard facts.\xc2\xa0 And the President is working with his national security team to evaluate the options available to him to respond, as well as consulting with international allies and consulting with members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to get your reaction to something that Senator John McCain said, Jay.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cAssad was able to use chemical weapons before and there was no response.\xc2\xa0 And so why not do it again?\xc2\xa0 This should surprise no one.\xc2\xa0 They viewed that not as a red line, but as a green light, and they acted accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction?\xc2\xa0 And is the President satisfied he\xe2\x80\x99s done enough to prevent --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday when we established with a high degree of confidence that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons on a small scale, relatively small scale, we did respond and we stepped up our assistance to the Syrian --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did you stop this apparent larger attack?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And there will be a response to this not \xe2\x80\x9capparent,\xe2\x80\x9d but clear and undeniable large-scale attack.\xc2\xa0 And that is what is under deliberation at this time.</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify -- at the beginning of the briefing you said that you had very little doubt the Assad regime was responsible for this, and you said there should be no doubt. And then you just most recently said the White House has a firm conviction that it was the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 So are you -- in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view, you\xe2\x80\x99re 100 percent sure that the Assad regime is responsible for this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We see no evidence of any alternative scenario. The regime has already used chemical weapons in this conflict against its own people on a small scale.\xc2\xa0 It has maintained firm control of the stockpiles of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It has the rockets and the rocket capability that were employed in this chemical weapons attack.\xc2\xa0 And it was engaged in an assault against these neighborhoods prior to the use of chemical weapons and in the aftermath of the use of these chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 You would have to be credulous indeed to entertain an alternative scenario that could only be fanciful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, we are working and discussing this with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 We are consulting with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And, as I mentioned earlier, the intelligence community is working on an assessment, and we will have conclusions that can be provided to the public available this week.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that it is clear already that chemical weapons were used on a large scale -- undeniable -- and that the Assad regime is the only possible force that could have deployed them.\xc2\xa0 And there has to be a response to that clear violation of international norms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just one other thing, more broadly -- when the President is facing a situation like the deliberations that he\xe2\x80\x99s currently having about what to do in response to Syria, what does the White House think its obligations are under the War Powers Resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about courses of action that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been decided upon, and that involves --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in general, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s philosophical -- how does he view his role and the White House\xe2\x80\x99s role in terms of what he\xe2\x80\x99s obligated to do under that resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we feel, generally, that it is essential to consult with leaders of Congress, and that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in a matter like this, even as we engage in a process of evaluating the options available to us.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve, as I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reported, had discussions with relevant members of Congress, and leaders of committees and leaders of the Congress at large.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following the inevitable response, whatever it will be, what steps is the U.S. prepared to take to secure the chemical weapons stockpiles?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The disposition of chemical weapons in Syria has long been a significant concern of the United States and our allies and partners, and it will continue to be a significant concern.\xc2\xa0 We have, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said earlier, confidence that the Syrian regime has maintained control of the chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 They have also used the chemical weapons under their control in Syria against innocent Syrians on several occasions on a small scale, and now on August 21st on a large scale, and that\'s a repugnant fact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I can\'t predict anything beyond the fact that this remains a significant concern of the United States.\xc2\xa0 The proliferation -- the disposition of weapons of mass destruction, the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an obvious concern of the United States, and the President has made it a very high priority to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve excluded -- the President has -- boots on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also outlined the concerns about the threats to the neighbors there.\xc2\xa0 So short of boots on the ground, what could the U.S. do to make sure that those stockpiles are secure?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have made clear throughout this conflict our views about the disposition of and the potential use or proliferation of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing now.\xc2\xa0 The violation is clear, and it has to be responded to in order to establish around the world that the Chemical Weapons Convention that 98 percent of the population has signed on to has to be respected.\xc2\xa0 Because the consequences of not respecting it are significant and grave, and threaten the national security of the United States as well as the international community.</p>\n<p>So I can\'t predict, as this conflict continues, what course of action the regime might take with its stockpiles of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the use of those weapons or the proliferation of those weapons must be, in our view, responded to because of the gravity of that transgression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whatever decision is made and whenever it\'s made, will the President seek U.N. approval or some sort of backing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\'t speculate about context here until the President has decided upon a course of action in response to this violation.\xc2\xa0 There will be a response, but questions like that depend on the course of action he decides to take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re leaving the door open for now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I suppose you could say that, Roger.\xc2\xa0 I\'m simply saying that I\'m not going to speculate about a course of action that hasn\'t been decided upon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 Does it make sense for the President to consult with G20 leaders in person next week before deciding?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that this is a grave transgression and it merits a response.\xc2\xa0 He will obviously take the time necessary to evaluate the options available to him in deciding upon what is the appropriate response by the United States in consultation with our allies and partners, in consultation with leaders in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And when he has decided upon a course of action, he will obviously inform the public about it.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put a timetable on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will be, as you know, attending the G20 Summit, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a fixed date and we are in the process of evaluating options in response to this transgression this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said earlier that Assad had a strategic purpose in using these weapons -- he was trying to clear this area.\xc2\xa0 Putting aside the goal of regime change, which you said is not yours right now, do we have any strategic goal at all?\xc2\xa0 In developing this response, is the goal to change the dynamic on the ground, balance of power, in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our view that the use of chemical weapons on the scale that we have seen now on August 21st, in Syria, merits a response.\xc2\xa0 And it has to be clear that there is a consequence to that clear a violation of international norms.</p>\n<p>So the goal here is to make clear that this is unacceptable; that it is a red line that has been crossed, and it is a red line that was established by 198 nations -- 98 percent of the world\'s population.\xc2\xa0 And to allow it to happen without a response would be to give a green light to the Assad regime and other potential users of chemical weapons that there will be no consequences to the use of chemical weapons, and that is profoundly not in the interest of the United States, our allies and partners, to the region, or the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a strategic goal, or are you just trying to send a message?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure the distinction you\'re making.\xc2\xa0 We are making -- we are evaluating options available to the United States to respond to this clear violation of an international norm.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the goal to have an impact on the conflict?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I made clear yesterday that we are engaged in a long-term policy of supporting the opposition in its struggles against the brutal war being waged upon it by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We are not evaluating this option as a measure to -- as part of an effort to effect the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a completely separate matter.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a separate matter, in our view, because it is a transgression of an international norm.\xc2\xa0 And our policy of support -- as I said multiple times today and yesterday, it is our view that the conflict, the ongoing conflict in Syria has to be resolved through a political transition.\xc2\xa0 It cannot be resolved through a military resolution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons you\'re supporting the rebels is to convince Assad to come to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 I thought that was the purpose of -- sometimes military effort is to achieve a negotiated outcome.\xc2\xa0 So this is not -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we view it as the correct policy, as do many nations around the world, to support the opposition in its efforts to withstand the brutal assault that Assad has been waging.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, though, there has to be a political process that creates the transition necessary for Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess my follow-up to that is you\xe2\x80\x99re potentially about to spend many hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in this response.\xc2\xa0 If it doesn\'t have a strategic purpose, why bother?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the purpose of a response is to make clear that the violation of an international norm that has been agreed to by the overwhelming majority of the nations of this world cannot go without a response, because the consequence of that would be damaging to U.S. national security interests, to the national security interest of nations around the world, and would do great harm to an already extremely volatile region of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any message in your response for Iran?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the message to Syria is pretty clear, as you\'ve described it.\xc2\xa0 Any message in this for Iran?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our view is that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons -- weapons of mass destruction -- has to be responded to.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that has to be made clear to any potential user of these kinds of weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President just on Thursday said that if one country attacked another without a U.N. mandate, it would raise questions about whether international law supported it.\xc2\xa0 When he said \xe2\x80\x9cU.N. mandate\xe2\x80\x9d in that context, what did he mean?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Christi, I don\'t want to engage in speculation about what decision the President will make or a course of action he has decided.\xc2\xa0 I think as I said in answer to Ed\'s question, that the President has long said as a candidate and as President that he will absolutely take action when he views that the national security interests of the United States are at stake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me just ask this:\xc2\xa0 Is it possible to have a U.N. mandate without having a Security Council resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'d have to ask our U.N. representation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just conceptually, is that possible?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Conceptually, I think it\'s related to the question at hand.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not going to speculate about what courses of action we\'re going to take until the President has decided on the option he wants to embrace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, a Wall Street Journal article says that why Obama is going into Syria after two years later -- the answer is Iran, because Iran has already involved itself in the war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The Iran factor, in short, is the elephant in the room.\xc2\xa0 So is Iran a bigger trigger than chemical weapons for U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Iran has been involved in supporting the Assad regime for a long time in this conflict.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear that fact and what it says about who Assad\'s friends are.\xc2\xa0 The options we are assessing at this time have to do with our belief that the use of chemical weapons needs to be responded to.\xc2\xa0 And that is the context of the decision-making process that\'s underway.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, at this time, is there irony for this White House and the President as you\'re 50 years out from celebrating and commemorating nonviolence and peace, and the President is looking at strong options against Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear ever since he launched his campaign for President that he, as Commander-in-Chief, will take actions necessary to defend the United States, to defend the national security of the United States, to defend the American people at home and abroad.\xc2\xa0 I think he gave a memorable speech about it, about his views on this matter, in Copenhagen in 2009.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ve seen throughout his presidency his commitment to ending wars, as he has demonstrated by withdrawing from Iraq -- when he views that as in our national security interests -- to winding down the war in Afghanistan, which is happening now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he has also demonstrated a commitment and a conviction that when national security interests of the United States are at stake, he will take action.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s a broad statement.\xc2\xa0 I am not presupposing in answer to any of these questions a course of action.\xc2\xa0 When the President has an announcement, he\'ll make it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m going to ask you one last question.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those -- especially those loud voices that we\'ve heard with some of the most recent wars, people who don\'t want strikes, who just want peace?\xc2\xa0 What do you say to them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to go down the road of answering a question that presupposes that the President has decided upon a course of action when he is evaluating options available to him. There are a variety of options available to him, and I will leave it to him to make that announcement when he has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though there are not boots on the ground, there could be military in the air.\xc2\xa0 And there are still possibilities as well.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s speculation about the options that are available to him.\xc2\xa0 But he is evaluating those options now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me make this -- Mike, the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The goal is essentially to punish the Assad regime and set an example of the Assad regime for violating the international norms.\xc2\xa0 How do you do that without weakening the Assad regime in a sort of a de facto way, turning the tide of the civil war, which you say should not happen -- their differences should be resolved by political means?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m saying that the decision to respond to the use of chemical weapons and the options that are under consideration as a response to that clear violation have to do with the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have a policy of support for the opposition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have a policy of significant humanitarian support for the Syrian people and for refugees in other countries.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue.\xc2\xa0 But this is a clear and distinct violation of an international norm, and it is our view that, as Secretary Kerry made clear yesterday, that we must respond to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it the goal of the United States to degrade the Assad regime\'s ability to deliver those chemical weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re presupposing courses of action that haven\'t been decided upon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But whatever the action is, would that be your goal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re presupposing courses of action, when you\'re talking about degrading military capacities, that haven\'t been decided upon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask a non-Syria question?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, last one.\xc2\xa0 Non-Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is meeting with mayors this afternoon about gun -- how to curb gun violence.\xc2\xa0 Is there some particular reason -- we haven\'t seen that in a while.\xc2\xa0 Is there a particular reason that\xe2\x80\x99s on the plan for -- the schedule for today, this week?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us, is there some specific piece of legislation or specific --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President remains committed to taking the action that we can, in the wake of Congress\'s and the Senate\'s, in particular, regrettable failure to pass common-sense legislation to improve our background check system, to take steps that we can to reduce gun violence in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we put forward -- the President put forward, with the Vice President, a comprehensive approach that included not just the legislative action that we believe needed to be taken, but also some executive action.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work on those issues, and we continue to engage with stakeholders around the country, including mayors, on this issue because it is of great concern to them, as it is to this administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they talking about legislation then?\xc2\xa0 Possible legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to read out a meeting that hasn\'t happened.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that we continue to engage in an effort to do everything we can to reduce gun violence in the United States against the clear majority will of the country, of states that are not normally considered blue or even purple, the Senate chose to block common-sense legislation that would have simply improved a background check system that everybody believes is necessary to make sure that people who should not have guns can obtain them.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have a specific agenda for you except that this remains an issue the President and the administration are concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand they\'re not coming out.\xc2\xa0 Will you release the list of mayors, please?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of what our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the speech tomorrow, can you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got to run, guys.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all can --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you brief tomorrow, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Meetings, meetings.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
