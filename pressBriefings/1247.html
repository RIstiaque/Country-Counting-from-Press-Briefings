EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A few follow-up questions on the meeting with lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 On taxes, the President outlined this accelerated negotiation process to come up with some sensible common ground, as he called it.\xc2\xa0 Did he suggest at all that he would be open to a temporary extension of the tax cuts for the wealthy?\xc2\xa0 Did he lay any markers down at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the -- I think both sides started and discussed where each had been on -- that our priority was ensuring that, as you heard the President say in his statement, that we make permanent tax cuts for the middle class that are set to expire at the end of this year, and to reiterate our concern for borrowing $700 billion over the next 10 years in making tax cuts for those in excess of $250,000 permanent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the Republicans restated their notion of making the wealthy tax cuts permanent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President wanted to -- as, again, you heard him say -- get to the process of having some of those discussions by asking Secretary Geithner and OMB Director Jack Lew to sit down with four members or senators appointed by -- one each -- by Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Speaker Pelosi and Representative Boehner.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that those conversations could happen as early as later today -- or start as early as today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you had -- it sounds like you started -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it sounds like you ended where you started with these broad philosophical differences about those tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 So what gives the President confidence that this negotiation process is going to be productive?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I think was the foundation for this -- for, quite frankly, the whole meeting was we have to do -- we have to do things that ensure continued economic strengthening and job creation.\xc2\xa0 We have to deal with our long-term -- with our short-term deficits and our long-term debt.\xc2\xa0 And we have to ensure the safety and the security of the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Secretary Geithner and NEC Director Summers both said -- both gave very quick descriptions of sort of where we thought the economy was.\xc2\xa0 And everybody, I think, as the President said, in the room agreed that this was an issue that we needed to get finished by the end of the year, before the tax cuts expired.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the charge that he gave to Tim and to Jack.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate -- again, I anticipate they\xe2\x80\x99ll meet relatively soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other quick ones, please.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell said that his caucus was united on doing the tax issues and the appropriations issues in lame duck first, and then if there\xe2\x80\x99s time left getting to some of the other pressing matters.\xc2\xa0 The President brought up START in his own description but didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to acknowledge any forward progress.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House willing to take up that issue in January if need be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there was a robust discussion about how that could be done in a lame duck.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard senators even today discuss the likelihood of being able to get that done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, the tax issue may take a little bit.\xc2\xa0 But the Senate and the House will be here.\xc2\xa0 And I think we believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue -- START is an issue that can get done this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You still think it is?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, finally, on the broader issue of cooperation, I heard Representative Boehner and Cantor say, in their words, that the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing -- the President acknowledged he had not reached out enough to them.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair portrayal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 I think the President acknowledged that he needed to do better and acknowledged that -- rightly that he would do his part.\xc2\xa0 I think there was a -- there was common ground reached in the notion, again, as you heard the President say in his statement, that the American people didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for gridlock.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for the continual games that we see played in Washington.\xc2\xa0 They voted for two parties working together to get something done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to take -- it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take just that, bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make progress.\xc2\xa0 And I think this meeting, which we -- which we set up, is the beginning of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 To come back to this idea of common ground on the tax cuts, specifically, what would the White House be willing to compromise on?\xc2\xa0 For instance, would the President favor extending --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was in the meeting, but the President did not tap me to be one of those negotiators.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Jack and Tim get into that as soon as we have the appointment of those members and senators from the designated leaders.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll begin talking as early as today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President favor extending all the tax cuts for two or three years?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s most urgent desire is to see that taxes do not go up on the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned a possible meeting out at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeframe for that?\xc2\xa0 And also a sense of who you\xe2\x80\x99d invite -- would it just be restricted to lawmakers?\xc2\xa0 Or could it be extended to the business community, for example?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the meeting that the President talked about with -- and I should -- just for a second, let me step back and talk about a little bit of the structure of the meeting because I\xe2\x80\x99m going to speak about this, but I was not in this part of the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The meeting lasted approximately two hours -- probably a little less than two hours.\xc2\xa0 The last 35 minutes was the President and the Vice President and the members of the House and the Senate, without staff, without Secretary Geithner, without OMB Director Lew in the private dining room right off of the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 So in that 35 minutes, the President -- that\xe2\x80\x99s where the President brought up the idea -- and they talked about it throughout the meeting, the idea of continuing these conversations, and threw out the hope that -- and I think it was agreed -- loosely agreed upon that sometime in the beginning of next year, they would continue this meeting at Camp David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President ask the staff to leave?\xc2\xa0 Was it that they were no longer needed at that point?\xc2\xa0 Did he want to have a more intimate conversation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think to have a little bit more intimate conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you talked about the President telling Republicans, as they describe, that he had not done enough to reach out to them, did he offer an apology at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, he said that -- he took responsibility for that.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, in order to have bipartisanship, we have to do this both ways.\xc2\xa0 And the President is ready to do his part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m still a bit confused about the divide that still exists on these tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 If the President still thinks that $700 billion is more than the country can afford, how can there be any compromise at all?\xc2\xa0 And I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate this now, but it seems like the divide is so wide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to enumerate -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enumerate all the property lines, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that -- I think it is safe to say, the President reiterated, that the notion of a -- the notion of a permanent -- the notion of making permanent tax cuts for those on the upper end of our income scale, the predominance of which go to millionaires and billionaires, is not something that -- not something that making permanent would -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe would make sense.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a $700 billion expenditure over -- because we do these in a 10-year budget window.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think as he did in his statement -- enumerated where he is on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is scheduled to leave for Hawaii December 18th.\xc2\xa0 Given this very lengthy agenda, what are the odds that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to delay --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s largely unknowable, but the President will be here for as long as he needs to be here to get progress on and to make progress on the issues that are -- that he outlined in the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the President in a way apologized or expressed regret for not reaching out enough.\xc2\xa0 Did Republicans offer any sort of apology?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 Not that I have in my notes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President sense that there is compromise possible on these issues that Republicans are willing to give?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there was -- I think there was a sense in the room in discussing a whole host of issues the understanding on both sides -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take taxes -- that we -- there was an economic imperative to provide certainty before the end of the year when these cuts are scheduled to expire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also mentioned, as you heard him say in his statement, there are things like AMT, the college tax credit and other issues that are set to expire and will impact those at all income levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think an agreement that we needed to get this solved by the end of the year, and an agreement that we all have a responsibility to work together to make progress and that in order to do so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be required to sit in the same room, have conversations and discussions like this and come to some common ground and agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes and I think -- without speaking for them but having read some of their comments after the meeting -- I think everyone thought it was a productive beginning in hopes of finding some of that common ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans have expressed concern about the fact that Majority Leader Reid has discussed bringing up the DREAM Act and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal that might eat up a lot of time that could be spent on the tax cuts or START.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share their concern?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President shares Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s concern -- or I should say the President shares Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s -- believes that it is also -- those are also issues that are important to the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think we talked about this a little yesterday -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think, again, I think the Senate is going to be -- this is -- the tax issues is not going to get solved in -- not likely to get solved today.\xc2\xa0 The Senate is going to be here and there\xe2\x80\x99s time to do -- there\xe2\x80\x99s time to do the people\xe2\x80\x99s business.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a long discussion about \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d because I think as many of you know, that very shortly Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen and others are going to discuss the public release of the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s review.\xc2\xa0 But -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a statement from the President on what that review has found.\xc2\xa0 But I think, in discussions that the President has had on this issue over the past few days, this is an issue that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t solve legislatively is going to get solved in the courts.\xc2\xa0 And solving that issue in the courts is not going to provide the Pentagon with the type of orderly transition that they\xe2\x80\x99ve said they need.\xc2\xa0 But we have the pathway to do it legislatively, make progress, and I think the President -- obviously the President still wants to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to put a period on this, the President thinks that funding the government, passing unemployment insurance extensions, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal, the DREAM Act, tax cuts and START all can be done --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the next 18 days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot to cover.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the President, and in fact, the President said that he acknowledged he had not reached out enough and would do his part.\xc2\xa0 But you just told Jake that the Republicans did not make a similar statement.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that they should have?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me do this, Chip.\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my hands full being the spokesperson for the President.\xc2\xa0 And, look, this was not something that was prompted.\xc2\xa0 The President -- I think the President just laid out that in order for us to work together we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to communicate better.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to reach out --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he also said he had not reached out enough.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe the Republicans -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-way street -- does he believe they have not reached out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask the President that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d leave that up to others.\xc2\xa0 The President was, I think, pretty clear about the fact that -- in acknowledging that he needed to and would do better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can only speak for the actions of what the President intends to do and what the President told leaders today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So his reaching out is not -- reaching out more is not contingent upon their returning the favor?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 His reaching out is contingent upon the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States and in order to get things done in what will now be a divided government requires working with the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to bend even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President is willing to have a better line of communication with Republicans on Capitol Hill to get something done.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d call that \xe2\x80\x9cbending.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I call that trying to work together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s incidentally likely what the American people call it, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too much into semantics here, but you talk to people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On common ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the -- yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Self-criticism lesson?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s that sign that said, \xe2\x80\x9cLast chance to not get into semantics.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And we might have passed that a few miles ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We never do that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We never parse words, either.\xc2\xa0 But speaking of parsing words, you said that what Jack and Tim had been tasked with is finding common ground.\xc2\xa0 Would it be accurate to say that they have been tasked with finding a compromise that can pass by the end of the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to make sure.\xc2\xa0 And on the tax issue, do you think there was a breakthrough in the meeting?\xc2\xa0 Was this a meeting that constituted a breakthrough?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, there is a -- we have an agreed-upon, appointed process for the continuing of those conversations to happen very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I will try to get as much information as I can throughout the day and share with you all about the progress and the scheduling for those meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also think that the notion that there was agreement that this is an issue that needed to be dealt with by the end of the year, I think those two things give -- I think they give the President and I hope they give others hope that we can work together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance whatsoever that the tax issue will not be resolved by the end of the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would hate to say never.\xc2\xa0 I think there is a extremely strong likelihood that the issue is resolved prior to the tax cuts expiring at the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 And I think there is -- I think there was strong agreement to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I think there was an acknowledgment on the part of all those involved that we have a window of time to work together on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little more than a month to come to a conclusion on that and we ought to be able to do so.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President believes we can get that done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More than a month?\xc2\xa0 We could be here like New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, I take it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ve got 31 days.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate being here on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Robert, is the next step the OMB director, the Treasury secretary and representatives of the different camps getting together and trying to hammer this out?\xc2\xa0 Or what\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I will -- the way they left it in the meeting, there was an agreement that we would have this group of people do this.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, I think rightly so, pushed to have a meeting as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, it could happen as early as today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Democratic position on the tax cuts truly unified?\xc2\xa0 I mean, publicly it sounded like maybe the President was ready for compromise, but perhaps some of the leaders on the Hill were not as eager to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe they were just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be the middle class and no higher-income extension.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, look, everybody went in with the position that they brought to that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President enumerated the position, as he said in the statement, that he and his fellow Democrats hold, and that is our priority is to ensure that those that are in the middle class in this country that have, as he said during the meeting, have been hurt throughout the past decade in terms of watching their wages go down even as they were working longer and working harder, that we had to do all that we could to ensure that for that group of people, their taxes didn\xe2\x80\x99t go up.\xc2\xa0 So I think that -- I think Democrats are very unified in that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you freer today to talk about the State Department cables, or are you choosing not to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The law continues to not allow me to speak about classified information, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s worth a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a period in which that becomes operable for me, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been several significant stories on the agenda the past couple of days.\xc2\xa0 But over the holiday weekend, obviously, there were great concerns about Korea.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your read of the situation in Korea right now?\xc2\xa0 Are we on the brink of war?\xc2\xa0 Have temperatures calmed a bit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say I think that there have been a series of meetings throughout the holidays and the weekend here at a deputy and a principals\xe2\x80\x99 committee level.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President spoke with President Lee in South Korea.\xc2\xa0 We dispatched for joint exercises the aircraft carrier George Washington.\xc2\xa0 And we remain committed to -- as you heard the President say a few days ago and during our trip to Seoul -- remain committed to the common security of our allies in the Republic of Korea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday, Mike, I think the Chinese have a duty and an obligation to greatly press upon the North Koreans that their belligerent behavior has to come to an end.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see progress on multilateral discussions around this over the next few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States government believe China has done enough so far?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get into grading them, Chuck, as much as I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s an obligation there, and we expect them to live up to that obligation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we let the record show that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have praise for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so far but said an obligation --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that the bottom line is movement and progress with the North Koreans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the meeting with the congressional leaders, was there an agreement among everybody in the room that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a whole bunch of votes on the floor until this smaller group with Lew and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can go back and check with others and see what their impression was.\xc2\xa0 But, again --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that the House -- it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that there are other votes on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that the -- I think the next vote on taxes, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check on this, is that there will be a vote in the House on making permanent middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there was no agreement of taking that off the table while --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate that that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- while this group worked itself out a compromise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that goes forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing, on START, did -- was there any attempt by -- conversation between, for instance, Reid and McConnell with the President sort of mediating and saying, okay, if he takes something off the plate, if he takes DREAM Act off the plate, and then START or any of those --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that was not a -- that was not something that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 The President spent several minutes walking through why he believed that this was most important -- why this was so important to our national security in verifying what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the Russian nuclear arsenal; obviously the reduction in deployed nuclear weapons that we all know is a danger; and our efforts in the world to continue to press on Iran and others like North Korea for the strongest possible sanctions and how all those efforts work multilaterally.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President believes and I think -- the President believes that we can -- we have enough time to get this done, while acknowledging that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a process to this.\xc2\xa0 That process also has included 18 hearings.\xc2\xa0 This has been something that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed for going on seven months.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President is optimistic we can get this done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there consensus on extending unemployment benefits in the room, or was it more of an urging?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not clear in my notes, but I will double-check with others.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was very clear that -- and this was also clear from both Larry and Tim in speaking in the meeting -- that unemployment benefits are given to those that have lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s money that is, almost dollar for dollar, put back into the economy.\xc2\xa0 And, look, the President brought up the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the beginning of the expiration of unemployment benefits and that even as we have these discussions about extending tax cuts for those who make $250,000, those who make a million, those who make $10 million a year, we certainly in no way can afford to look past the fact that there are those that have been hurt extensively in losing a job and need to continue to have those benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that argument met with any sort of Republican agreement on this, or did --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I recall in my notes, to be honest with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is this a bright line?\xc2\xa0 I mean, has the President said, look, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get this, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to yank this off the table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- Chuck, I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall any bright lines in it, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 I think the President simply laid out, as Tim and Larry did, the importance of ensuring that this be and must -- that this must be part of the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going back and forth here on the permanence of tax cuts for those that make a lot of money.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there an okay -- were you guys agreeing on any way of paying for it, saying, look, if you guys -- because Republican stance has been, find a way to do this, find a way to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 Did you guys offer up, here is a way to pay for it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President mentioned that this is normally and has historically been considered, rightly so, a measure of extraordinary importance and extraordinary times and should be considered the same now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 One, the President said in his statement that on the tax cut negotiations he hoped to get some answers back over the next couple of days.\xc2\xa0 So does that mean that he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that there is an agreement within the next couple of days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we can -- look, if you could get an agreement today, that\xe2\x80\x99d be great.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President is saying is we want to continue to see forward progress on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the agreement to come out of this meeting with those that would sit down, again, as soon as later today, I think give the President some hope.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as I have updates on that schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, but is he setting up an expectation that he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to have a deal within a matter of a few days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is setting up the expectation that we\xe2\x80\x99ll all get in the same room and continue to make progress on this over the next few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this was quite a long meeting.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk at all about what else came up?\xc2\xa0 Did \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d come up?\xc2\xa0 Did DREAM Act come up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Both of those came up, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was it a matter of people just going around the room and stating their previously stated positions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that -- again, the meeting started out with the President opening up, and then I think each of the eight members and senators spoke about what they saw as important in the short term and in the medium term.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say the tax issue took up by far the majority of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the President asked both Tim and Larry to give an update on where they thought we were economically.\xc2\xa0 Again, I should note that my timing and my percentages here does not include the 35 minutes in the private dining room without staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those two issues came up -- did the President bring this up, or did others?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President started on the issue agenda after everybody had had a chance to say something, walking through and talking about taxes.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s when he offered to have Secretary Geithner and OMB Director Lew sit down with Democrats and Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And besides the offer of the Camp David gathering, do you know anything else?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything else that was discussed during the 35-minute closed portion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout from that, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President would give that to me to read out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did anybody raise the nature of the campaign rhetoric that came up before the election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you mean Slurpees?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to mention that by name, but as long as you brought it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Slurpees were not mentioned.\xc2\xa0 My apologies to 7-Eleven.\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, look, I think there was an acknowledgment, honestly, Mark, by everybody that an election had come and gone, and that after elections there is a time in which both parties are responsible for governing the country.\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned and I think others mentioned that -- the acknowledgment that not soon after one election passes, you enter the political season again, but that he believed -- the President certainly believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a time in which we can seek common ground, that we can work together and that we can make progress on these issues; that there\xe2\x80\x99ll be plenty of time for -- there will be plenty of time for a political campaign in 2012.\xc2\xa0 And I would -- I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s line in his statement that -- acknowledged and agreed to by those in the room -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to put our focus on their jobs, the jobs of the American people, not on the jobs of the elected officials that sit in that room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction here to the Senate vote on earmarks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some on that.\xc2\xa0 I missed that because I was in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But let me take that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to shift over to the debt commission.\xc2\xa0 Apparently Erskine Bowles and Senator Simpson were down here just recently here today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they were having lunch with the Vice President, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan is saying that the debt commission is having trouble getting a vote and that they\xe2\x80\x99re going ask for a delay until Friday.\xc2\xa0 Can you fill us in on that?\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Roger, I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would point you to the commission and their staff to answer that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know definitively the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Another question, Senator Schumer has suggested as a possible compromise in the tax cuts of raising it from $250,000 up to $1 million.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?\xc2\xa0 Does that have shades of a compromise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, quite frankly, see that it has -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that it has moved any Republican, and I think the President has restated the case today for a $250,000 threshold for those filing together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ari.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President put any limitations on concessions that Geithner and Lew can make in these negotiations, or is he willing to accept anything that they agree on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating for him, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how closely will he watch these negotiations, then?\xc2\xa0 I mean, will he keep tabs on the back-and-forth?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I anticipate that the President will on occasion ask his Treasury Secretary what are the byproducts of said negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, obviously this is -- I mean, again, the majority of the roughly hour and 25 minutes that was spent with staff in the Roosevelt Room was done on taxes, and as Laura mentioned, that part of the statement where the President hopes to see some progress in the next few days.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be eager for -- and all the participants -- were eager for getting together as quickly as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Reid said to Secretary Geithner and to Director Lew, you just tell us what time and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have our people there.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think this will happen quickly.\xc2\xa0 The meetings, I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President do a better job in the last two years of reaching out to Republicans?\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s been asked that question in the past he\xe2\x80\x99s rejected the premise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President -- without looking too much backward -- I think the President understands that we are in a period of, as I said earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to enter into a period of divided government, that in order for a piece of legislation to make its way through the House and the Senate to get to his desk it\xe2\x80\x99s going to go through a body that\xe2\x80\x99s controlled by one party and then go to a body controlled by a different party.\xc2\xa0 So if -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require better communication; that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require more communication; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require a better relationship in understanding on both sides what\xe2\x80\x99s important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is acknowledging that and willing to do his part in changing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a particular reason he decided to move the meeting from a larger gathering to a smaller one?\xc2\xa0 Was there something particular that happened in the larger session that made him decide that something could be accomplished --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President just wanted to give everyone an opportunity to speak as -- I mean, people were speaking pretty freely, but if people wanted to do so without note-takers and such, that they\xe2\x80\x99d feel free to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was productive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President mention to Senator McConnell his statement about his first priority being to deny him a second term?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I recall.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And moving to a different subject, do you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I -- as I said to Mark, I think there was an acknowledgment that there will be time for a political campaign, but that now is a time for those responsible for governing the country to get about doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President discuss his priority for whether Senator McConnell is reelected?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I recall that, either.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different subject, President Medvedev in Moscow gave his State of the Union equivalent address today and said that there might be a new arms race if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a cooperation agreement on missile defense; expressed some frustration that things hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone as far as he wanted in Lisbon.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- I mean, look, I think the President mentioned in the meeting with the leaders just a little bit ago that we had actually made great progress on missile defense.\xc2\xa0 We had -- what was -- what had been a contentious issue just several years ago now is part of an agreement with NATO with the cooperation of Russia, and that that made -- look, we had made -- and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been an acknowledgment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- both parties have had a priority on protecting our friends and allies in Europe, and obviously the United States.\xc2\xa0 And our agreements in Lisbon make concrete years of effort into a missile defense apparatus that provides greater protection for Europe and for the United States, and that he was pleased with that progress, and that that was not -- nothing in that, nothing in START constrained our ability to do that.\xc2\xa0 That was clear, even as you had the head of NATO pushing and advocating for ratification of START; was also working through getting NATO on board for missile defense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say, taking this a step back, the President reiterated to those in the Roosevelt Room the genuine importance of -- and why it made so much sense for our security and in working with Russia and Medvedev, why it made so much sense for us to get this done and get this done now; that this was not something that the President was doing for political purposes or that the opposition was based on politics, but that this just made good sense and made common sense for our security and for our relationships around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to the information the Wall Street Journal reported about the Russians moving tactical weapons, nuclear weapons, closer to NATO countries in recent months?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just get something from NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s -- tactical is not something that\xe2\x80\x99s -- those are different from launchers and deployed missiles in START.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 North Korea warned today that the continuing military exercise by the U.S. and South Korea in Yellow Sea could lead to all-out war any time.\xc2\xa0 So how effective does the administration believe the military exercise could deter North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, their -- I guess I would disagree largely with the statement that exercises that are going on now or have -- that are similar to exercises that have gone on in the past are -- will lead us to where they said in that statement.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 I think the exercises demonstrate our strong desire for common security with our allies in the Republic of Korea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also could you -- sorry, could you give us some detail about the coming meeting between the U.S., Japan and South Korea next week in D.C.?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get that from State and NSC.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President secure from the Republicans any commitments on the two-year pay freeze for rank-and-file government employees?\xc2\xa0 And did he urge them to do the same for their own congressional staff?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the latter came up.\xc2\xa0 I know that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that they talked about.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, legislative branch appropriations govern the salaries of those working --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President would like to see it extended, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him, Ann.\xc2\xa0 But, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that members of Congress -- based on their appropriations -- have the power to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several members mentioned, on both sides, that -- spending and the deficit obviously was something that was talked about quite a bit, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a series of decisions that might not be popular in individual districts, particularly around the Washington area, but that are hard decisions that ultimately have to be made if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make progress on our deficits and our debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the -- several applauded the President for making that decision.\xc2\xa0 I will be honest in saying that some believed that non-uniform military and others they thought should have been covered in what the President announced yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But I think what -- the President believes that, as you heard yesterday, that we all have a responsibility to do our part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now that the embargo has been lifted on the military review on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d what kind of value does the President put on the kind of poll, the survey done of American military personnel -- about 28 percent of them responded.\xc2\xa0 They basically said they saw no problems, foresaw no problems getting rid of the policy.\xc2\xa0 Does the President put a lot of weight in that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- the President wanted to and the Pentagon conducted a study of the attitudes of those serving in our armed forces bravely each day and asked directly their attitudes on ending what the President believes is a divisive policy in \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a statement on this shortly, but the President has been clear that this is a policy that should end, needs to end.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the survey demonstrates that those that serve in the military believe it can be done in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disrupt unit cohesion and that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The survey didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask whether it should.\xc2\xa0 It asked do you think the military can --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, no, no -- and I think the overwhelming majority said that they thought it would -- could be done with little to no disruption.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President certainly shares that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from Secretary Gates -- well, you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen -- and the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong belief that doing this through a legislative process provides for a transition that -- an orderly transition that the military has sought and that the President believes is the right way to go about doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about that private part of the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 Does he -- has he done that before, where he sends all the staff out of the room?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual writ large in meetings.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back and check notes and see whether that\xe2\x80\x99s happened before in -- I do not recall that it\xe2\x80\x99s happened before in the bipartisan meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The ones that were had in Cabinet Room, as best I can remember, were always what was set forth in the room and not -- and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t generally repair to somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You made note a minute ago that note-takers were out of the room for that.\xc2\xa0 Was that private part of the meeting specifically to interrupt the spin cycle that the President talked about happening?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it just -- I think it provides people with a candid -- they can be even more candid than they could be in a room full of people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President would -- sought to do it.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the President believed that both parts of the meeting were productive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And someone in that meeting -- in that part of the meeting, brought up the spin cycle.\xc2\xa0 He said it was \xe2\x80\x9cone of my friends\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmy friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you know who brought that up and what was said about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I was -- no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama acknowledged that he needed to improve his communication.\xc2\xa0 Is some of that going to include some more informal talks, or off-the-agenda discussions between him and Republican leaders like Secretary -- Senator McConnell and Boehner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think that -- look, they\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- he\xe2\x80\x99s had occasion to talk with Senator McConnell and Speaker-to-be Boehner during some of this time period.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that those are conversations that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do not think that -- well, I know that what the President discussed and what the President means in terms of improving that outreach and that communication is not simply reserved for meetings that happen here or meetings that happen at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see just an increase in all types of that communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more quick one about START.\xc2\xa0 The President talks a lot about what might happen in January if this process is pushed back in terms of re-educating new members about the treaty and what\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\xc2\xa0 Did he bring that up in the meeting with Republican leaders?\xc2\xa0 And did they have any response or acknowledgment of his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that coming up.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s been -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty long record of hearings, formal written questions back and forth out of those hearings on where -- on different aspects of the treaty, and I know that members of our national security team continue to brief members on it, and I think anybody that has questions can get those answered.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on a historic story -- stick with what you have right now -- on that side of Pennsylvania Avenue, the House is getting ready to pass Cobell, Black Farmers and the water rights issue.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House have to say about this, after 15 years it\xe2\x80\x99s finally going to happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think based on hard work both on Capitol Hill and in the administration that we are about to or on the cusp of seeing a much deserved settlement for these two important cases.\xc2\xa0 It is, as you mentioned, April, justice that is overdue and has been a priority, again, of the administration and those on Capitol Hill to see something done by the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it demonstrates that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to work together.\xc2\xa0 I think it demonstrates that we can find common ground on issues that are important to both sides of the political aisle.\xc2\xa0 And I think it gives people hope for what we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a couple questions on the Black Farmers issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been raised the anti-fraud issue, the anti-fraud language that\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill.\xc2\xa0 Some Dems on the Hill feel that it could be a tool for intimidation against the farmers.\xc2\xa0 What say you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have to ask -- I guess I would point you to USDA on what their reaction is to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more.\xc2\xa0 Why is there a difference in the stringency for judgments when it comes to women and Cobell versus the Pigford II climate -- the Pigford II people had to go -- go through a much more arduous process to get --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to USDA on the specifics of that settlement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a signing ceremony, since this is one of the largest civil rights payouts --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on a question from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing that you might have read out, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I got a readout on it.\xc2\xa0 It was about the meeting between the President and the service chiefs yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And the question was, what did they talk about?\xc2\xa0 And did the President specifically ask them to stop opposing the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d or to get onboard?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- the President asked -- I was not in the meeting, as I said yesterday, because of being out here.\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to have a private conversation with the Joint Chiefs and asked that that conversation be private, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to violate the President\xe2\x80\x99s wishes on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m told that the -- \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d obviously, was the entire topic of the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but so the reason we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard more is because we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hear more?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I tried, and the President was clear that this would be a private meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House view at this moment on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Haiti with the presidential election and the cholera epidemic?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from these guys on Haiti.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s strong message yesterday regarding the WikiLeaks, has the President felt compelled to call any of his -- any of the leaders -- for example, Prime Minister Cameron or anyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, to my knowledge, has not made -- not made any calls on this.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this continues to be handled at the State Department at the foreign minister level.\xc2\xa0 And I would say -- I would reiterate largely what we said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Our foreign policy is far stronger than one website.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question about timing, Senator McConnell said in his news conference that the Senate might be able to take up START if they could quickly clear the decks of tax cuts and stop-gap spending, or an extension of omnibus spending bill.\xc2\xa0 So is part of the understanding in the room, behind the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments about wanting answers quickly, is that you\xe2\x80\x99d get a quick deal on tax cuts in order to leave time for a START debate in the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President understands the desire to have a discussion on START and believes that that can be accomplished.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President was clear with the leaders that he has -- he\xe2\x80\x99s faced with two roles:\xc2\xa0 ensuring our economic strength in creating jobs and protecting the American people.\xc2\xa0 He does not have the luxury of deciding only to do one of those things.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the President thinks that the Senate can only do one of those things, either.\xc2\xa0 And I think we can make progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A follow-up to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s question about the missile defense.\xc2\xa0 The Russians, when they discuss the issue, they keep sounding as if they -- they keep saying they want real partnership and they keep sounding as if they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the U.S. is ready for a \xe2\x80\x9creal partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 After Lisbon, do you have a feeling that both sides understand what each one means by \xe2\x80\x9creal partnership\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 And is the U.S. ready for such a partnership on missile defense?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that Lisbon demonstrates that an issue that had been contentious can be cooperative.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the administration through its phased adaptive plan set forth a missile defense apparatus and program that we believe more greatly protects our security.\xc2\xa0 And we pursued and got NATO to sign off on the pursuit of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think writ large in our relationship with Russia we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- and the President mentioned this today -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made tremendous progress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working together on issues that two years ago separated us.\xc2\xa0 I think Iran sanctions is a good example.\xc2\xa0 I think that only because of the strong and real partnership we have were we able to see the type of sanctions that are having a real bite and a real impact in Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that relationship is important to this country and to this President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one thing on the same subject.\xc2\xa0 President Medvedev actually referred to a \xe2\x80\x9cstrike capability.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He said that if this partnership does not materialize, then within that 10-year period that he described Russia will have to take a hard decision on the strike capability, that it will have to deploy.\xc2\xa0 Was it the way that the Russians framed this issue in Lisbon, and do you have any idea what strike capabilities they are talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to your comrades in Russia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 One quick question.\xc2\xa0 On the way in I saw President Carter headed into the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Was he going to meet with President Obama?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe his schedule had a meeting with our National Security Advisor and I believe the President also asked President Carter to stop in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding Korea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is all I know, and I will try to find more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he be available for reporters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my bailiwick.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell him to go the stakeout.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I will say that you guys both wanted to see him, how about that?\xc2\xa0 I will try to get some more information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:38 P.M.
