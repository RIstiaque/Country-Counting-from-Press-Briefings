Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:47 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Just a quick thing I want to mention at the top, if I may. Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to send the full Senate two more important pieces of the President\'s plan to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 Providing districts with resources to make their schools safer and closing loopholes that allow felons, the mentally ill and others who should not have guns to avoid background checks are important measures that will help save lives.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to continuing to work with Congress on this and on the other important pieces of legislation that are part of the President\'s comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that, I\'ll go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Darlene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start off by objecting to the decision this morning to limit the President\'s remarks to just the print pooler and not a broader pool.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I take your objection.\xc2\xa0 I think it was live-streamed, so everyone in America with electricity and a computer could see it today.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s true, but --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it\'s live-streamed on whitehouse.gov, we should allow the TV cameras in as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I take your objection.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we also don\'t want to see a situation where live-streaming sort of takes the place of us actually being in where the President is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know that\'s certainly not the case.\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate the point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what was the reason for it today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we made a decision based on the fact that it was live-streamed.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a print pooler there -- or was there -- and it was available for everyone to see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But many events have been live-streamed and you\'ve let the pool in and any other reporters with hard passes in.\xc2\xa0 Why the change this time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it was just because of the logistics of this, and the fact that it was live-streamed and the print pooler was sent.\xc2\xa0 I would not read anything bigger than the decision today into today\'s decision.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the gun vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, how will -- will that factor into the President\'s discussions today with the Senate Democrats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s safe to say that when the President meets with Senate Democrats, as he will in a little bit, he will discuss an array of topics.\xc2\xa0 I think he will commend the Senate Democrats for their focus and persistence in making sure that the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized, and the President was very glad to be able to sign that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe will focus on the work that Senate Democrats have done with Senate Republicans to advance bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He will, I\'m sure, as you note, Darlene, talk about the progress that Senate Democrats have made towards the goal of bipartisan measures to reduce gun violence in America.\xc2\xa0 And he will certainly discuss -- well, as I mentioned yesterday, he may bring up concerns he has about the unnecessary delays that have confronted our nominations, the historic delays.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJust yesterday, I believe, the Senate finally confirmed someone to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals who was filibustered for something like 464 days.\xc2\xa0 So you would think there must have been something disturbing about his nomination, that there must have been great opposition to it.\xc2\xa0 Instead, he was voted and confirmed 91-0.\xc2\xa0 That I think is emblematic of a problem that we have in the confirmation process.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe will also, of course, talk about budget and fiscal issues, the work that Senator Murray is doing on a budget for the Senate and the work that he is engaged in, discussing with lawmakers of both parties to try to find common ground on these issues -- on the need to reduce our deficit in a balanced way, the need to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform, to move forward with measures to reduce gun violence, to take action to ensure that we\'re investing in education and infrastructure and innovation -- the areas that will allow our economy to grow and create jobs in the future.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\'s a big agenda here and the American people want action on all of that.\xc2\xa0 So those will likely be the subjects.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Ryan budget, is there anything in there that you can provide that you would find positive about it, that might prompt some breakthrough on a major deficit reduction deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President had lunch with Chairman Ryan last week, as well as Congressman Van Hollen.\xc2\xa0 He is engaging with lawmakers of both parties and has, notably, had the dinner with Senate Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But the engagement is broader and deeper and continues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe put out a statement today -- I put out a statement about our view of the Ryan budget.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly believes that Congressman Ryan is sincere in what he believes his budget represents in terms of policy priorities, and he commends Congressman Ryan for the effort, but there is no question that the Ryan budget, again, represents a series of policy choices that this President profoundly disagrees with.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I noted in my statement, it aims to reduce the deficit, but the math doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up.\xc2\xa0 And you have a situation where you either have to -- as we saw last year when there was a proposal put forward by Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s running mate, in order to lower the rates the way that he proposes, there is no way to do that in a revenue-neutral way without raising taxes substantially on middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 There is simply no way.\xc2\xa0 Outside economists made that clear last year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe problem is more severe with this budget, because the fact is that Chairman Ryan takes as his baseline the increase in rates for the wealthiest Americans that was achieved through the fiscal cliff compromise and instead of going from -- therefore going from 35 percent down to 28 percent, which is what Governor Romney proposed in his tax reform plan that was untenable and would have resulted in massive tax hikes for the middle class, Chairman Ryan would make that cut from 39.6 to 25 percent and the result would be even more punishing for middle-class Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the other side, again, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we look at the Ryan budget as a perfect example of why balance is so necessary, because this is the alternative to balance.\xc2\xa0 It results in unfair tax hikes on middle-class Americans and it results in an undue burden on middle-class Americans through the cuts envisioned either on education, or investments in infrastructure, and elsewhere -- and innovation -- and those cuts, of course, harm our future long term, our future growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut then on the entitlement side, voucherizing Medicare is an option the public I think overwhelmingly rejects -- rejected last year, rejected the year before, does not believe is good policy.\xc2\xa0 But beyond public disapproval, it does nothing to deal with the fundamental problem here, which is rising health care costs.\xc2\xa0 It actually exacerbates that problem, but shifts the burden from the Medicare program to seniors, asks them to pay the difference.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\'t, obviously, keep true to the promise of the guarantee that the Medicare program represents.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we see a lot of differences.\xc2\xa0 There is no question.\xc2\xa0 But the President does believe that there is a consensus in America about the need for a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 There is a consensus, a majority -- certainly a consensus in the Senate about the need for a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 So Senate Democrats, House Democrats, the President, the public, and a lot of Senate Republicans have expressed interest in a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 So for that reason, the President believes there is cause to continue the effort to try to find common ground and compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve cited a number of things that the President will say today up on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is he going up there to give a speech, or is it a conversation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly have some things to say at the top.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll interact with members, as he will, I believe, in his other meetings with both Democrats in the House and Republicans in the Senate and the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this morning the National Journal quoted a senior administration official who spoke anonymously and said about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trips to the Hill and this outreach to Republicans, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a joke.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re wasting the President\xe2\x80\x99s time and hours.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all (in the media) are happy because we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is this a show?\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel this is a joke?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw that story, Jim, and I appreciate the question because I have no idea who said that, but I can tell you that opinion has never been voiced in my presence, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s presence, in the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 It does not represent the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 It does not represent the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view, and it does not represent the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did you talk to the President personally about this to make sure that this was not his view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I talk to the President every day about this very issue, and the answer is he believes strongly that it is important to engage with lawmakers of both parties in order to find common ground so that we can move forward not just on our budget issues, but on the other issues that confront us.\xc2\xa0 And there is great opportunity to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have seen progress on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We have seen progress, as I mentioned at the top, in the Congress, in the Senate on efforts to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 We need to make progress on enhancing our energy independence.\xc2\xa0 We need to make progress on rebuilding our infrastructure, because it puts people to work now and it makes us more competitive economically in the future.\xc2\xa0 And there is reason to believe that we can do that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re not na\xc3\xafve.\xc2\xa0 There are disagreements and obstacles.\xc2\xa0 But the President is at the head of this effort because he believes deeply in it.\xc2\xa0 And that comment again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who said it, I have no idea, but it does not represent in any way the President\xe2\x80\x99s view or the views of this White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And about the Ryan budget, it does away with the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature legislative achievement, health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And I was just curious -- does the President view or does the White House view that as bargaining in good faith?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President believes that Chairman Ryan is sincere in his views.\xc2\xa0 I think many --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people are calling it delusional.\xc2\xa0 Is that a word you\xe2\x80\x99d use?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it has been -- the House Republicans have voted more than 30 times to repeal Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 That seems at some point to be time not well spent.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important to expand health insurance coverage to the millions of Americans who will be covered because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And we have been moving forward with implementation of the Affordable Care Act, working with states around the country on establishment of exchanges, working with states around the country on the expansion of Medicaid coverage, and working with governors of both parties.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there has been some news in that regard just recently.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, we have profound differences at a substantive level with the budget proposed by Chairman Ryan.\xc2\xa0 It is in many ways a reiteration of his proposals of the past.\xc2\xa0 The biggest difference is that he\xe2\x80\x99s able to take advantage of -- for baseline purposes and at least deficit reduction on paper -- the revenue increases that he opposed and the President put forward and the Medicare savings that he opposed and the President put forward.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do is plausibly deal with deficit reduction in a way -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a choice here.\xc2\xa0 Either you reduce the deficit or balance the budget, as he says, by having to raise taxes on the middle class and voucherizing Medicare and all the other deep cuts and unnecessary programmatic changes that are included in there, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t actually reach deficit reduction, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- or both, you do both -- and you still stick it to the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo on the issue of the tax reform, we did go through this last year.\xc2\xa0 And it was widely viewed when it was proposed by Governor Romney as untenable because you simply can\xe2\x80\x99t find $5 trillion in loopholes and deductions only from the wealthy and well-connected through tax reform to make it revenue neutral, to achieve the kind of tax rate reduction that Chairman Ryan and Governor Romney envisioned last year with Chairman Ryan, and Chairman Ryan envisions this year.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not mathematically possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the result is that the middle class ends up paying, and the middle class ends up paying for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, after all, those in the top bracket would see something like a 37 percent pay cut -- I mean tax cut, a 37 percent tax cut, from 39.6 to 25 percent. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hefty.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the principle that the President has put forward that we need to ask the wealthy to contribute to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a position that the public widely supports.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the need for balance many times, and pointed out the President has put out some entitlement reforms and that\xe2\x80\x99s a critical part of balance.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect -- do you hope that when the Senate Democrats release their budget tomorrow, that it has entitlement reforms along the lines of what the President has proposed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will wait for the budget to be put forward and Senator Murray to do that.\xc2\xa0 We do expect it to be balanced, to have the principle of balance inherent in its proposals.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it will be -- in agreement on every item of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, but it will be consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s balanced approach, we expect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will it fall short if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have entitlement reforms, if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of things the President has put out there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it yet and I would wait until it\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.\xc2\xa0 But I would simply say that it will be consistent in terms of balance, we expect.\xc2\xa0 That is where it would strongly differentiate -- be differentiated from the House Republican budget.\xc2\xa0 And the President commends Senate Democrats for pursuing a budget that includes the balance that he believes is necessary, the public believes is necessary, the Bowles-Simpson commission has long since made clear is necessary.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we look forward to working with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans and everyone on Capitol Hill, including House Republicans and House Democrats, in hopes of achieving a compromise that achieves -- that has within it the balance that is essential.\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so instructive about the budget proposal from Chairman Ryan, is that it really does make the case for balance, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have balance, if instead of asking the wealthiest to contribute to deficit reduction, you say we\xe2\x80\x99d like to give the wealthiest a huge tax cut, the result is that everybody else -- the burden is doubled or tripled on everyone else.\xc2\xa0 And that just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem fair.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also not good economics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, when you say balance, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean balanced.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes asking everyone to pay their share.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a balanced budget, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, what the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal will do, as his previous proposals have done, is achieve the economically important goal of bringing our debt-to-GDP down below 3 percent.\xc2\xa0 That was the target set under the Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson commission, the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal commission.\xc2\xa0 It is the target widely recognized by economists as a necessary goal when we talk about getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 And it is a goal that\xe2\x80\x99s achievable in a way that also allows other goals to be achieved -- like investing in our economy so that it grows; like building roads and bridges so that we\xe2\x80\x99re competitive with Europe and China and India; and investing in education so your children and mine are getting the jobs that pay the best and they\xe2\x80\x99re getting those jobs here in the United States in 25 and 30 years.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has never viewed budget proposals as -- or proposals in negotiations for deficit reduction as having as their only goal deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Deficit reduction is an absolutely important goal, and it is important to bring our deficits down and to reduce our debt-to-GDP.\xc2\xa0 But they are part of -- those goals are part of the broader purpose here, which is to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And if you achieve one without the other two, you have not done right by the middle class of the country, and you probably have undermined the future economy of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus has been on balance.\xc2\xa0 On the important goal of deficit reduction, he has signed into law, as you know, Jon, $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction thus far, and he looks forward to working with Congress to bring that total to beyond $4 trillion, which, in turn, if done in a balanced way, will achieve the goals that I just laid out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be disappointed if Senate Democrats did not include one of the reforms that you often talk about from this very podium, on entitlements?\xc2\xa0 Superlative CPI or chained CPI?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has a proposal that he made to the Speaker of the House --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If no one endorses it in your party does it also suggest it has a political -- a radioactivity to it that people are afraid to touch?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the question supports what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying all along, which is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal includes items in it that are very tough choices for Democrats to go along with, A; B, that stands in stark contrast to proposals in a Republican budget that makes a tough choice of voucherizing Medicare while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if nobody is willing to vote for that, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a process that has the Senate putting forward a budget and the House putting forward a budget, and the President putting forward a budget.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully through regular order, which leaders of both parties have said they would like to see, and which the President would like to see, we will see a compromise that results in a balanced package of deficit reduction that allows the economy to grow and to continue to create jobs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that will include tough choices for Democrats on the entitlement side, and tough choices for Republicans on the revenue side.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you recruit a Democrat to come up with an amendment on the CPI?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re getting down into the weeds of process. You and I both covered the Hill and that\xe2\x80\x99s fun stuff, but the President is looking at a higher objective here, which is to work together with lawmakers of both parties to find that common ground and compromise that is essential if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward in a way that helps our economy, reduces our deficit, protects seniors, strengthens the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the preamble to his budget, Paul Ryan says it is economically essential to get to balance.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that balance, meaning zero, no deficit, is economically irrelevant?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the economically important goal, as economists have said repeatedly -- outside independent economists, as well as the much venerated Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson commission -- is achieving the goal of reducing our debt-to-GDP ratio to below 3 percent.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals do that.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe goal of balance is worthy and it should be pursued, but it should not be pursued if it is done in a way that does harm to the economy, does harm to senior citizens, does harm to the middle class, and gives short-term benefits to the wealthy -- because, in the end, everybody suffers if the American economy is weaker because of an implementation of a budget proposal that\'s so profoundly unbalanced that it does not allow for the growth and expansion of the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You made reference a moment ago to Ryan\'s budget.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying he is tacitly admitting in that budget without saying so publicly that the tax increase and the revenue from the health care law make his job easier?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\'t put words into his mouth.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s my understanding that he includes as part of his baseline the revenue achieved through the fiscal cliff deal, the ATRA, and that means the revenue achieved from raising the rates on the wealthiest individuals that the President fought for.\xc2\xa0 And it achieves the savings in the Affordable Care Act that the President put forward, the Medicare savings -- getting rid of waste fraud and abuse and reducing payments to insurance companies, subsidies to insurance companies and the like.\xc2\xa0 Those are savings that of course were highlighted in the Republican campaign against the President last year and criticized greatly, but they are included in the budget.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On balance, the President talks a lot about everyone paying their fair share.\xc2\xa0 The IRS has a report out claiming that 312,000 federal employees owe over $3 billion in federal taxes.\xc2\xa0 And that includes, I believe, 40 employees of the Executive Office of the President.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to make sure everybody here, everybody in the federal government, is paying their fair share of taxes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that everybody ought to pay their taxes.\xc2\xa0 And for details on the report, I would refer you to the IRS.\xc2\xa0 But absolutely the President believes everybody ought to pay their taxes.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the IRS is the place to go for more specifics.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the Ryan budget, how can you attack the Ryan budget when you are standing here without an Obama budget?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 The President will be putting forward a budget --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- in the next several weeks, probably the week of April 8th, I would expect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me write that down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that new?\xc2\xa0 Did you make news?\xc2\xa0 I think you did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But as you know, Ed, the President has put forward a proposal that will be reflected in his budget and the principles will be reflected in his budget.\xc2\xa0 And that proposal, as you know, because you covered it, that he made to the Speaker of the House demonstrated his willingness to find common ground with the Republicans on both revenue and entitlement cuts, demonstrated his seriousness of purpose, demonstrated his belief that balances is essential in our pursuit of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And that offer has been on the table ever since he made it to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 And sadly, the Speaker has not taken it up.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he declared he would never negotiate with the President again, which was a rather stark proclamation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you mentioned the President\'s proposal.\xc2\xa0 It is on the White House website, as you said many times.\xc2\xa0 I printed it out to make sure I have it.\xc2\xa0 Last question on this -- it says, for example, this is the President\'s proposal to Speaker Boehner, $100 billion in cuts to defense discretionary spending.\xc2\xa0 As you understand, that\'s not really a budget, though, because we don\'t know where the $100 billion in cuts will be.\xc2\xa0 Which programs of the Defense Department does he want to cut specifically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the opportunity to provide the budget in advance, but we have provided --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other budgets are being put on the table this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have you looked at the Ryan budget?\xc2\xa0 Can you find a single item in tax reform, a single loophole closed to achieve $5 trillion -- $5 trillion!\xc2\xa0 That\'s a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 Not one.\xc2\xa0 I would challenge you to find any entitlement reform in the Ryan budget beyond the adoption of the President\'s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will invite Paul Ryan to come here and defend his plan.\xc2\xa0 However, the President\'s plan is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is ample detail in the President\'s previous budget, which goes into his defense -- the levels he calls for, for defense spending that are consistent with the national security plan laid out by his national security plan laid out by his national security team.\xc2\xa0 And the budget the President puts forward will have the detail that presidential budgets tend to have, which are, unfortunately, lacking in the House Republican budget.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Kristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The Ryan budget also calls for moving forward with construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Given that the State Department has said that the pipeline won\xe2\x80\x99t have a serious impact on the environment, will the President now give that project the green light?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no updates for you on that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously an assessment that is housed at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 There are a series of steps that are taken, as I understand it, by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The assessment that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned is one of those.\xc2\xa0 But that process is ongoing, in keeping with years of tradition, when we talk about trans-border pipelines, as this one is.\xc2\xa0 And when there is an announcement to make we\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to announce it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, taking it another way, is this a potential area of common ground, given the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s assessment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would set aside -- I have nothing to say to project about an announcement that is not ready to be made and that is part of a process that is undertaken at the State Department.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will make the point that since this President came into office, we have dramatically increased our domestic energy production, we have dramatically reduced our imports of foreign oil, and we have dramatically expanded the production of renewable energy and investments in clean energy technology, all of which represent the President\xe2\x80\x99s all-of-the-above energy approach -- an approach that will allow us to become increasingly energy independent, will assist in the effort to create high-paying, quality jobs in cutting-edge industries of the future in the United States, and that will allow us to in the future withstand the shocks caused by fluctuations in global energy prices, global oil prices.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are experiencing elevated prices right now, and this is another reminder of why we need to pursue the kind of comprehensive, all-of-the-above approach that the President has pursued and which has yielded results.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to pursue that in his second term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to go back to the timing of the budget, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve now confirmed will come out in April.\xc2\xa0 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said today that the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to submit his budget in April would be like dropping a bomb on the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction and how does the President not in some way negatively impact the legislative process?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that anytime the President introduces his budget that perhaps Senator McConnell or some other Republican will say it was wildly inappropriate or inconvenient to do it that day or that week or that month.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just stipulate that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen the President introduces his budget, it will be an important contribution to what we hope will be a process of regular order where a compromise is reached that embodies the principles of balance when it comes to deficit reduction that the President supports, that Senate Democrats support, House Democrats support, a lot of Senate Republicans support, the vast majority of the American people support, and that enables us to deal with these important issues even as we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with other challenges like comprehensive immigration reform, like reducing gun violence, like investing in education and innovation and infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Because our fiscal challenges are important and our budget priorities are very important, but we have other priorities, too, and the American people expect us to be working on all of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that this sort of outreach is a waste of time.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about the limitations of personal diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned his golf game with Speaker Boehner and noting that a deal didn\xe2\x80\x99t really come of that.\xc2\xa0 So what is the White House view -- that personal diplomacy and engagement can be helpful in the legislative process, or is it that partisanship in Washington is just so deep-rooted that it\xe2\x80\x99s really unrealistic to think that that kind of outreach can break through those barriers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that personal engagement is important, that relationships are important, that conversation and discussion are important.\xc2\xa0 And he is engaged in that process, as he was in a series of negotiations with Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell and others, and as he was throughout his first term on different issues.\xc2\xa0 But he is engaged, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, in a sort of more intensified process of consultations with lawmakers -- Republican lawmakers as well as Democratic lawmakers -- because he believes that there are circumstances now, partly born of misfortune -- the decision to embrace the sequester by Republicans -- but circumstances that allow for the time and space, if you will, for serious conversation and debate within the regular order process to try to move forward on these budget issues, and to hopefully create an environment -- or improve the environment when it comes to bipartisan cooperation on these other issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think I noted yesterday that it is worth standing back and assessing the landscape here and acknowledging that despite our partisan differences there is important quality work being done by Republicans and Democrats together on some very important issues.\xc2\xa0 And that extends beyond deficit reduction and budget issues into immigration reform and gun violence and other areas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President believes this is an important process and he has enjoyed his consultations thus far.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to his meetings with the conferences and caucuses this week on Capitol Hill, and that process will continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing from various sources, Jay, what the President has intended to be delivering in terms of his message to the leaders in the Middle East next week.\xc2\xa0 On the flip side, what is the President looking forward to hearing from the leaders in Ramallah and in Amman and in Jerusalem in terms of their insight and their message to him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President looks forward to all of his meetings on his trip.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to get ahead of it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will be doing, as we have traditionally, a background briefing prior to the trip to fill you in on more details of both the program and what we expect from the trip.\xc2\xa0 But the President will hope to hear from the leaders he meets with assessments of all the issues that are top of the agenda when you consider Israel, the West Bank, Jordan and the leaders that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything more specific for you than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How will the President measure the success of his trip?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the President greatly looks forward to this visit, that he will be engaging with leaders on the range of issues of importance in the region and with the leaders specifically, but that we\xe2\x80\x99re not laying out markers for success on the peace process or otherwise.\xc2\xa0 These will all be part of important conversations that the President will be having.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMara and then Scott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that the Ryan budget will result in tax hikes for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 He envisions a 25-percent top rate and a 10-percent rate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why -- where are the tax hikes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you remember, I thank you for the question, I was probably using shorthand, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xc2\xa0 Last year when Governor Romney put forward a proposal to reduce -- a tax reform proposal that would have cut rates not quite as far, but I believe the top rate to 28 percent and the other rate -- I forget, what -- Jon, do you remember?\xc2\xa0 Anyway, two rates, but not quite as low as Chairman Ryan, and 28 was the top rate.\xc2\xa0 There were assessments done by outside economists that made clear that the only way you could achieve the goal of that tax reform being revenue neutral -- lowering those rates so dramatically and somehow making it revenue neutral when you\'re making these massive tax cuts would be to, through tax reform, stick it to the middle class to the tune of more than $2,000, eliminating deductions and the like that middle-class Americans depend on, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s deductions for health insurance or education or home ownership or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying their net taxes will be higher in the end?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about it.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 By a significant amount.\xc2\xa0 When it was the Romney plan, it was $2,000 on estimate -- the Tax Policy Center, I believe, assessment.\xc2\xa0 And since the gap is larger here, the reduction in the Ryan plan is from 39.6 percent to 25 percent, as opposed to 35 percent to 28 percent, that the hole that needs to be filled through middle-class tax hikes is even larger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tScott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious about what specifically the President talks about when you say he talks to the Hill about energy independence.\xc2\xa0 Is it spending more money on developing an American green economy?\xc2\xa0 Is it other -- increasing natural gas exports?\xc2\xa0 Can you be a little bit -- is it climate change-related?\xc2\xa0 What exactly is he saying specifically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, to torture you with a phrase, it\xe2\x80\x99s all of the above.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s that the President has embraced increased development of our traditional forms of energy.\xc2\xa0 That includes our remarkable strides in development of natural gas, as well as increased development of oil.\xc2\xa0 It includes investment in and development of renewable energy sources.\xc2\xa0 It includes measures taken when it comes to the environmental side of it, the climate side of it.\xc2\xa0 Important actions taken, most specifically the car rule, which will dramatically reduce -- or increase fuel efficiency and reduce consumption thereby.\xc2\xa0 And that contributes in two ways.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it contributes to our environmental health, but also reduces, again, our demand for fossil fuels, which reduces -- continues the reduction in our demand for foreign sources of oil.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an approach that the President really sees as comprehensive, and only through that comprehensive approach can we achieve the kind of independence from outside energy sources that we all believe, I believe, would be beneficial to our national and economic security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talking to legislators.\xc2\xa0 Is he talking about legislation to them as well as --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any proposals, legislative proposals to preview for you.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we can take steps to increase development of energy resources in the United States, both traditional and renewable, as well as take steps to enhance efficiency and improve the quality of our air.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he did in the first term, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDonovan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 At the risk of getting a little bit in the weeds, I want to ask a little bit more about the budget.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House envision the process for reaching a fiscal deal?\xc2\xa0 Leave it up to the committees in Congress and provide technical assistance?\xc2\xa0 Or maybe have the President get directly involved?\xc2\xa0 Like, how does this look?\xc2\xa0 What does this look like?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I was saying earlier, leaders of both parties in both houses have expressed interest in returning to regular order.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s shorthand, but for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the picture that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to paint here, we have been, as the President often notes, living in -- governing by\xc2\xa0 crisis, lurching from crisis to crisis to crisis, often crises determined by fabricated deadlines around debt ceilings or fiscal cliffs or sequesters that have taken us out of the regular process, which is a budgetary process that has been the one that is traditionally pursued to set our budget priorities and allocate spending and decide what our revenue streams look like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think everybody in Washington -- there is a consensus -- and this was a topic of conversation at the dinner, as participants noted -- there is a growing consensus about the desire and need to return to normalcy, to regular order.\xc2\xa0 And through that process, through a budget produced in the Senate and a budget produced and passed in the House, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, that we can come together and find some -- find agreement on a budget that, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, hopefully will represent the will of the American people as reflected in data that we see every day, as reflected in the election.\xc2\xa0 And that is for a balanced approach to deficit reduction that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the name of deficit reduction, slash our investments in education or in innovation or research.\xc2\xa0 Because these are things -- this is eating your seed corn.\xc2\xa0 Doing that makes the future less bright economically for the whole country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we need to make wise choices when it comes to deficit reduction, and wise choices when it comes to spending cuts and spending investments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just the shorthand, regular order, a return to normalcy -- that means basically --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought I explained it with great detail.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the President will be engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 The White House will be.\xc2\xa0 The administration will be.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, this is something that legislatively moves through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I want to say all this and make clear that I am not being na\xc3\xafve about the challenges that clearly remain.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward proposals and will continue to put forward proposals that represent balance, that represent tough choices for him and for Democrats, that compromise on the issue of revenues, as he has done in the past, but achieve that balance because it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe is engaging with Republican lawmakers, trying to find common ground around the idea that we can do entitlement reform and tax reform together in a balanced way, the way that the American people want.\xc2\xa0 But it remains to be seen if the result of this embrace of regular order and embrace of common ground is an achievement that fits the bill here, which is a resolution, a budget that reduces the deficit in a balanced way, hits the target of $4 trillion-plus over 10 years in deficit reduction, allows for the investments that are necessary to keep our economy growing, protects middle-class Americans and seniors.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are mindful of the challenges, but we believe there can be and should be common ground and compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the run-up to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Middle East trip, he\xe2\x80\x99s been meeting with American Jewish leaders and now Arab American leaders.\xc2\xa0 But one of the participants in the Arab American group\xe2\x80\x99s meeting said this is the first meeting of its kind that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the President.\xc2\xa0 Why has there not been one before this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, but I will take your question.\xc2\xa0 The President has been engaged with leaders of different communities throughout his presidency, both in the first term and now in his second term.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate in advance of this trip to have these meetings, and they were both very productive meetings and helpful to the President, and hopefully helpful to those who participated in hearing the President\xe2\x80\x99s views about the various issues that will be discussed on his trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he hear that will help him on this trip?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read out a private meeting, but the President values greatly the insights provided by, in this case, both Jewish American leaders and Arab American leaders in these meetings, as he does appreciate the outside advice and observations that he receives on a variety of issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has the President received a letter from CBC Chairwoman Marcia Fudge about the President\xe2\x80\x99s lack of nominations of African Americans to Cabinet posts in his second term?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe we have received that letter, and I can tell you that the President is deeply committed to diversity in his Cabinet and to ensuring his administration reflects the breadth of our country.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the best decisions are made when he is surrounded by people who share different perspectives, as we work toward improving our economy and building a strong middle class together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean that the President will in the next couple of weeks nominate an African American to a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements to make today.\xc2\xa0 When the President is ready to make announcements, he will make them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what has the President said about this?\xc2\xa0 Because she has made it clear in her letter that many African Americans around the country are calling into the CBC offices very upset because they supported him overwhelmingly, and they have yet to see an African American nominated to a Cabinet post right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t have any personnel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously still appointments the President will be making.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you, as I made clear at the top, the President is committed to diversity.\xc2\xa0 He believes that having a diverse Cabinet and a diverse set of advisors enhances the decision-making and deliberation process for him and for any President.\xc2\xa0 And so he values it greatly and that\'s why he has pursued it both in his first term and continues to pursue it in his second term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the information that hackers claim they have put on the Internet is legitimate -- Mrs. Obama\'s social security number, some of her financial information, along with other officials including the FBI Director?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On this I have to refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have anything for that on you -- I have no assessments to offer, just a reference to the Secret Service.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Chris.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on April\xe2\x80\x99s questioning there.\xc2\xa0 There are new reports that the President is close to making his nominees for the Labor and Commerce Secretary.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of hope within the LGBT community that the President would take the opportunity with those vacancies to appoint the first-ever LGBT Cabinet member.\xc2\xa0 But it looks like it\'s not going to happen now.\xc2\xa0 And you just mentioned how the President values diversity, and I\'m just wondering if that excludes LGBT people.\xc2\xa0 Does the President not believe that sexual orientation and gender identity are elements of diversity that you want to see at the highest levels of the administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Chris, I have no personnel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 I certainly am not confirming any speculation in the press about possible announcements the President might make.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you, again, to what I said and what the President has said about the value he places on diversity, and encourage you to assess the diversity of his appointments once they\'ve all been made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is sexual orientation --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- I don\'t have any -- you\'re asking me to make a statement about appointments that haven\'t been made and I\'m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get ahead of the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to make a statement on value -- does the President believe that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President values diversity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is sexual orientation and gender identity part of that diversity?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And the President values diversity.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Export Council this morning.\xc2\xa0 The Council has long favored a territorial tax system, and I know the President has disagreed with them in the past.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reevaluation going on within the administration on a territorial tax system?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\'t have anything new for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President has said about this represents his views.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything new for you.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we need to reform our corporate tax code.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything new from what we\'ve said in the past about it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions -- one foreign and one domestic.\xc2\xa0 First, the foreign.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. and South Korea are engaged in joint military exercises right now.\xc2\xa0 When those conclude, is the President seriously considering leaving behind any assets like a nuclear-armed sub or anything to assist with any deterrents against North Korean provocation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a speculative question, A; B, it\'s not a question that I think I can answer from here.\xc2\xa0 I would just tell you that these are military exercises that like all combined forces command exercises are defense oriented and designed to enhance readiness and the ability to respond to any potential contingency that could arise.\xc2\xa0 You heard me talk yesterday about our view of the provocative rhetoric emanating from the DPRK.\xc2\xa0 You heard me talk about the actions taken at the United Nations Security Council in response to North Korean behavior and decisions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we continue to work with our allies on this issue, but I don\'t have any defense posture announcements to make from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the budget, on its face, it looks like the President is waiting for the Democrats to come out -- the Senate Democrats to come out with their plan that\xe2\x80\x99s unpalatable, the Republicans in the House come out with their plan that\xe2\x80\x99s unpalatable, and then come out in April with his own compromised plan that will be more palatable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It will be entirely palatable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s out of regular order when the law requires the President put a budget out in February.\xc2\xa0 So is it worth ignoring the law in order to own the compromise?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is worth getting to yes if there are Republicans willing to get to yes, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the timing of the budget is reflective of that goal, but I think the goal here is to find willing partners who embrace the idea of a balanced approach to deficit reduction as well as who embrace the idea of bipartisan cooperation in tackling some of the other challenges that won\xe2\x80\x99t be solved if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a bipartisan way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you admit that regular order involves the President presenting a budget in the first week of February?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will be a useful and valuable contribution to a process that, at least potentially, could result in a bipartisan compromise that achieves balanced deficit reduction, that includes the essential investments in our economy that allow it to grow and protect the middle class, and that would be part of a process -- again, this is in an ideal world -- that will see bipartisan cooperation on not just these issues, but other issues, because the American people really expect that and want that.\xc2\xa0 And the President is focused not just on deficit reduction and budget matters, but on the other things that we can do together in Washington that will help the country help the economy and help the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:36 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
