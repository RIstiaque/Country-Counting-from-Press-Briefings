EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way from the Bay State, Beantown, to Atlanta, Georgia, the Peach State and Hotlanta.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top, so I will entertain your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Associated Press, please.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, NATO called the downing of the Turkish jet unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 They said they condemned it in the strongest terms.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the administration\'s view on this?\xc2\xa0 And is there a concern there could be retaliatory action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that there could be retaliatory action here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From Syria?\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that the NAC met a Turkish request and determined Syria shooting down a Turkish fighter jet, as you said, on June 22nd to be an unacceptable act, condemning it in the strongest terms.\xc2\xa0 The United States and NATO stand in solidarity with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 We will work with Turkey and other partners to hold the Assad regime accountable and to continue to push forward for Syria\'s needed political transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would note that recent high-level military defections to Jordan and Turkey are another testament to the regime\'s loss of control over the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It is clear, however, that Assad is desperate to hang on to power at all cost, as evidenced by his continued use of air power and Shabiha gangs.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would just refer you to NATO and the North Atlantic Council in terms of their statement, but obviously we stand with Turkey and we stand by our allies in NATO and at the NAC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on that, the Turkish Prime Minister had some pretty strong language, and I wondered if the President was concerned if that sort of quite pointed rhetoric increases the risks of escalation and tensions along the border between Turkey and Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the comments were more measured than you described, and as the North Atlantic Council made clear, this was an unacceptable act.\xc2\xa0 The United States remains in close contact in Turkey, with Turkish officials, as they continue to investigate the incident and determine Turkey\'s response, including in the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 We will work with Turkey and other partners to hold the Assad regime accountable and as part of our efforts to promote a democratic transition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We commend Turkey for its measured response thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what conclusions does the administration draw from the fact that the fighting seems to be getting closer and closer to Damascus?\xc2\xa0 Is that also a symptom of what you said was a growing lack of control by Assad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair assessment.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, Bashar al-Assad has been slowly -- too slowly -- losing his grip over his country.\xc2\xa0 The process because of his refusal to step aside has been horrific and has exacted a terrible toll on the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 Thousands and thousands of Syria have paid for Assad\xe2\x80\x99s hubris with their lives.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe it is so essential for the international community to come together and do everything it can to help bring about the political transition that the Syrian people desire and deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have any reason to believe that the Russians are any closer to supporting the sort of political transition that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had very productive conversations with the Russians, and we continue to have those discussions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we have differed on the issue of Syria, but we and the Russians agree entirely that there needs to be a peaceful transition in Syria and end to the violence in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur view is -- the United States\xe2\x80\x99 view is that that transition cannot include Bashar al-Assad because of the heinous acts that he\'s perpetrated on his own people.\xc2\xa0 He has relinquished any credibility he may have once had, and must step aside so that the Syrian people can build the future that they deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a couple of domestic questions?\xc2\xa0 The first is on the budget showdown, fiscal showdown that\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xc2\xa0 Congressional leaders from both parties are now acknowledging that they are considering postponing the automatic federal spending cuts until March of 2013 rather than January, and if they went that course it would likely include an extension.\xc2\xa0 It also would include an extension of the Bush tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I want to know, what does the administration think at this point?\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Hispanic question also.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to negotiate the end of the year budget developments from here.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that you know the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 The way to avoid problems that some folks fear at the end of the year or next year is to come together and pass on a bipartisan basis a deficit and debt reduction plan that is balanced, that gives everyone a fair shot, requires that everyone does their fair share and makes sure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat kind of balanced approach is one embodied in the President\'s several proposals.\xc2\xa0 It is embodied in every bipartisan proposal that\'s been put on the table.\xc2\xa0 It is embodied in every assessment made by independent economists when they look at what needs to be done here.\xc2\xa0 The holdouts here thus far have been Republicans in Congress who, by and large, have refused, as the President has noted, to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a single nickel extra in order to deal with our medium and long-term budget challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tA balanced approach is required because -- not just because it would be entirely unfair to ask seniors and students and others to bear the burden of getting our deficit and debt under control on their own, but because we need to have a balanced approach in order to ensure that we\'re making the proper investments in education, innovation, research and development, clean energy that are the foundations of economic growth in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 To slash funding for education, to slash funding for innovation and research and development, to slash funding for clean energy would be to cut off our nose to spite our face, economically.\xc2\xa0 It\'s foolish policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the Bush tax cuts, as you know, the President does not support extending the high-end tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 He does support and would sign tomorrow a bill that would extend permanently tax cuts for the overwhelming majority of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the Republicans need to decide if they will hold those tax cuts hostage, if they will choose to raise taxes on middle-class Americans, raise taxes on 98 percent of Americans, simply because they insist that the wealthiest Americans who have benefited most substantially from the Bush-era tax cuts do not pay their share.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Hispanic voter question, yesterday, the President issued a statement on the Supreme Court\'s ruling, left it at that.\xc2\xa0 We attended several campaign events -- he didn\'t directly raise the issue.\xc2\xa0 Today is different.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to Florida, very important Hispanic population, two fundraising events with hosts or guest stars who are Latino in origin.\xc2\xa0 Is this an issue that he will address more directly today with these voters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a preview of the President\'s remarks today.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s position on the need for comprehensive immigration reform is clear.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s position on the Arizona law is clear.\xc2\xa0 It is why the case was brought eventually before the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the Supreme Court ruled to strike down three of the four provisions of the law.\xc2\xa0 The President was pleased by the development.\xc2\xa0 He is concerned, the administration is concerned about the manner in which Section 2 will be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to the Department of Justice for more questions about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would say that what we heard yesterday -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on these issues -- on Arizona, on comprehensive immigration reform, on the DREAM Act -- are clear. Other\xe2\x80\x99s positions are not so clear, except beyond what I deduce<br/>\n\t-- what I saw to be the only conclusion one can reach based on the response of Republicans, including Governor Romney yesterday, is that he and they still believe that the Arizona law is a model for the country.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly disagrees with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we go to Europe?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Turn this plane around.\xc2\xa0 So the President phoned -- spoke with Italian Prime Minister Monti yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Clearly a great deal of anxiety in the financial markets ahead of the summit at the end of this week.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe further what they talked about, what the President said to the Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 And has he made any other calls to European leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no other calls to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 If I do in the future, I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly bring them to your attention.\xc2\xa0 On the call with Prime Minister Monti, this is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s continuous engagement with his counterparts in Europe on this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou heard him speak at the G20 and the G8 about our position on the European crisis, the eurozone crisis, the role that we played, that he has played, that Secretary Geithner has played in terms of offering our advice and counsel based on the experience that we, the United States, have; our strong conviction that Europe needs to take action to address the need for growth and job creation as it pursues necessary reforms.\xc2\xa0 So these are the topics that the President and the Prime Minister discussed, as well as specific issues that are being negotiated and discussed by European leaders in the run-up to the EU summit Thursday and Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if Merkel remains sort of -- isn\'t yielding, I mean, does not even come more on board for the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, Germany has played a very important role in this and continues to play a very important role in this.\xc2\xa0 We believe the Europeans have the capacity to resolve this crisis.\xc2\xa0 There was consensus emerging from the G8, reaffirmed at the G20, that growth and job creation is very important.\xc2\xa0 There was consensus on the need to take steps for fiscal consolidation and other measures to stabilize the situation in the eurozone.\xc2\xa0 And our role has been to help support that process, to offer the advice that comes from the experience we had in the United States where we obviously had a financial crisis that was severe and could have been even more severe had we not taken the steps we took.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is news today that Cyprus is requesting a bailout as well.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that the IMF commitments that were made at the G20 -- or the commitments to the IMF bailout are insufficient or might be insufficient if more smaller countries continue to request bailouts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Treasury Department for an answer regarding Cyprus, and remind you that our position on the IMF is that we\'re not making any additional commitments -- the United States is not.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the IMF plays an important role in this process.\xc2\xa0 But the Treasury Department may have a fuller response with regards to Cyprus.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about Thursday as well.\xc2\xa0 The outlook is pretty certain that the health care decision is going to come out on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any plans -- will the President make a statement either way if a decision comes down in the morning?\xc2\xa0 Will we hear from the President that day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements to make about potential presidential statements or appearances.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, confident that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, in keeping with decades of precedent under the Commerce Clause.\xc2\xa0 We continue to implement the law accordingly, and we are ready for the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, whatever it may be.\xc2\xa0 Once that decision is rendered, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make decisions about what to say about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Europe, briefly.\xc2\xa0 Expectations for the summit seem to be diminishing by the day.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration still confident that the signals that were seen in Mexico about what the Europeans were going to do are still going to be followed up in Brussels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would quickly say that we continue to believe that Europe -- eurozone leaders have taken a number of very important steps, and need to take more steps towards stabilizing the situation and resolving the crisis.\xc2\xa0 The G8 meeting was a milestone along the road; so was the G20.\xc2\xa0 And so will be, I expect, the EU meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe never expected that these very complicated issues would be resolved at any one gathering of any single group of leaders. This is a process.\xc2\xa0 It has moved along considerably in the last several months, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will continue to evolve as it moves forward this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, another thing that\'s going to happen on Thursday is supposedly the contempt vote in the House on AG Holder.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any attempt by the White House to try to avoid that vote or is there any --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, the Department of Justice is engaged in an effort to try to resolve this.\xc2\xa0 And if the Republicans decide not to have this be a purely political issue, we think that this could very easily be resolved.\xc2\xa0 But it has not been resolved yet, and I think that points to the obvious political nature of this effort by House Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can go over again the enormous number of documents that have provided, the hour after hour after hour of testimony provided by the Attorney General and other officials, the fact that the assertion of privilege begins after the letter sent on February 4th to Congress, demonstrating that the assertion has to do with the absolutely necessary internal deliberations within an administration over how to best respond to a congressional inquiry and media inquiries, and not to the Operation Fast and Furious itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe chairman of the committee himself said the other day, Sunday, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence of White House involvement in any attempt to "cover up" the Fast and Furious operation, or any involvement at all in the Fast and Furious operation.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, to quote a leading House Republican, this is about politics.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a distraction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re days away from seeing 7.4 million American students have their student loan rates double.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to deal with that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an urgent priority.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re days away from a situation where, absent action by Congress, tens of thousands -- hundreds of thousands of construction workers will find themselves without work and idle.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an urgent priority.\xc2\xa0 Partisan political gamesmanship is not an urgent priority.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s, unfortunately, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in this oversight effort by the House Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Today is primary day in New York State.\xc2\xa0 Charlie Rangel has been campaigning and emphasizing his ties to the President.\xc2\xa0 Is the President supporting Charlie Rangel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think our position on that has changed.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tCan I just say while I still have you that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some really silly reporting about the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks regarding Kevin Youkilis last night.\xc2\xa0 It is highly commendable in my view as a Red Sox fan that this President has always refused to pander on sports.\xc2\xa0 He is a White Sox fan.\xc2\xa0 He owns his fandom of the White Sox, and proved that again last night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd anyone who knows Boston and knows the Red Sox, and who was in that room, knows that the preponderance of people shouting in response to what the President said about Kevin Youkilis were saying "Youk," not "Booo" for god\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll remind you, there was a time in 2007, when Alan Solomont had urged the President to wear a Boston Red Sox cap when he went out to Fenway and he refused to do it, and even mentioned it, because he is a White Sox fan.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t think the American people appreciate it when politicians suddenly pretend they\'re fans of another team just to try to curry favor.\xc2\xa0 The President is very serious about his sports.\xc2\xa0 He will not do that.\xc2\xa0 He will not cross that line.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- was just done too soon, that the Boston fans were just sad to see Youkilis go?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m a fan --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m a Red Sox fan as well, Jay \xe2\x80\x93 is all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am very sad to see Youkilis go.\xc2\xa0 He has a fond place in my heart for all he contributed to two World Series teams.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was some friendly booing in there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not saying it wasn\'t.\xc2\xa0 People in Boston, I think, were sad to see Kevin Youkilis go.\xc2\xa0 But the President is not going to pretend he is not a White Sox fan.\xc2\xa0 And if Kevin Youkilis helps the White Sox this year, I\'m sure he will circle back to the subject.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnything else?\xc2\xa0 Youk is Y-O-U-K.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:40 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
