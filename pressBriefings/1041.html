EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good to be back at the White House after our trip to the G20.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make at the top, so I will start with your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Erica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the IAEA report, should we anticipate any change in U.S. policy or posture toward Iran, based on those findings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of a report that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out yet.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we certainly expect it to echo and reinforce what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and its failure to live up to its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And it will, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, echo our concern about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I can also say is that because of the leadership of this President, we have mobilized the international community in a way that has never existed before to take action to pressure Iran, to isolate Iran.\xc2\xa0 We now have in place the most aggressive, isolating and debilitating sanctions regime ever.\xc2\xa0 And that regime has had an impact, as the Iranian President himself recently noted.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We continue to focus on a diplomatic channel.\xc2\xa0 And it is because of the kind of consensus that we have achieved at the international level among our partners and allies in dealing with Iran, that we were able to continue to isolate and put pressure on Iran, and to insist that Iran get right with the world and to live up to its international obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any possibility the U.S. would conduct a military strike on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear facilities?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are focused, as I just said, on diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 We, of course, never remove from the table any option in a situation like this.\xc2\xa0 But we are very focused on diplomacy, and we certainly think that that is appropriate, and that our approach here has had the kind of effect, the positive effect, in terms of pressuring and isolating Iran, that I just noted.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how would the U.S. view military action by Israel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would simply reiterate that we are focused on working with our international partners and allies on isolating Iran, pressuring Iran, pushing it to live up to its international obligations with regards to its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That approach has had an effect, and it has certainly -- we are certainly now in a situation that did not exist before, where because of the dual-track approach that this President took and this administration took, it is now clear to the world that the United States is not the issue here -- it is Iran, it is Iranian behavior.\xc2\xa0 And that has allowed us to mobilize the international community in a way that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t existed in the past, and to come together putting pressure on Iran to change its behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the change of government in Greece, and the latest turmoil in European markets today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on the ups and downs of financial markets.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the consensus that has been reached in Greece over the need to implement the country\xe2\x80\x99s reform commitments to the IMF and the European Union.\xc2\xa0 And we urge the government to move as quickly as possible to fulfill the commitments required under its new rescue program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, broadly speaking, moving back in terms of the G20 and the positive progress made there, of which the aspect of the agreement with regard to Greece is a part, we continue to call on Europe and work with our European counterparts to implement those decisions rapidly, and to reach a conclusive endpoint in terms of dealing with this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Erica\xe2\x80\x99s question -- once the IAEA report comes out, do you anticipate pushing for more sanctions, and if so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of a report that is not out yet, that nobody has seen.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we expect it to echo concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve long held about Iranian behavior.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of specific reaction to that report when it comes out, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait until it comes out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the new allegations against Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move in the back here -- Cheryl.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to the State Department IG\xe2\x80\x99s decision to investigate the Keystone Pipeline?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a process that, through executive order and longstanding precedent, is run out of State.\xc2\xa0 It is a process that includes input from a variety of agencies and departments within the administration; it is not done in a vacuum.\xc2\xa0 But on that specific question I would refer you to the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Brianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, voters are set in Mississippi to move tomorrow on adding a so-called personhood amendment to the state constitution that would say, legally, life begins at conception.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a response to this, a thought on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it.\xc2\xa0 You know his position on choice and women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive rights, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to this referendum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about this?\xc2\xa0 And I mean, it seems to be launching this issue, obviously, to a much higher platform, especially depending on the outcome tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Concerns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we wait and see.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to this matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go -- yes, all the way back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Quick question on President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Asia:\xc2\xa0 We know he\xe2\x80\x99s going to push hard on TPP during the APEC Summit, and also he might announce more U.S. troop presence in Australia.\xc2\xa0 So what -- is this part of his return-to-Asia policy?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s his goal at the APEC Summit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the President or even our preview of that trip today, but I will say that, broadly, the focus on the Asia-Pacific region reflects this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to this country\xe2\x80\x99s economic future.\xc2\xa0 The whole rebalancing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about is very important, and the APEC Summit, as well as the East Asia Summit and the other elements of this trip, reinforce this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the kind of rebalancing and refocus that we -- that he has long believed is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it goes right on the economic front to our -- his goal, rather, to double our exports and increase our trade, specifically with the countries in Asia-Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 So, broadly speaking, our goals for the trip have everything to do with that economic part of our relationship with the region, although there are many other elements as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eleanor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, President Clinton has a book out called \xe2\x80\x9cPutting Americans Back to Work.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How do you view his role in trying to break the impasse on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Does he have a role?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the book is very helpful and that it reinforces the positive steps that President Obama has taken and the positive steps he is now trying to take with Congress and is taking independently through his executive authority.\xc2\xa0 We welcome President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s adding his voice to this, as he already has, because he certainly has a lot of experience in a situation like this where we need to focus with great intensity on the number-one priority that the American people have, which is the need to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think there was a poll recently -- there have been a lot lately -- but in the last couple of days that asked the American people what their number-one concern was, what their priority was, and I believe it was over 50 percent said the economy and jobs.\xc2\xa0 Not another issue even got into double digits, which then makes you wonder why some in Congress are not focused on that priority but are focused on other issues that are of much lower priority to the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this President is pushing very hard, as you know, for Congress to pass provisions of the American Jobs Act since Republicans in the Senate have blocked the jobs act as a whole.\xc2\xa0 And now some of the provisions of it, he will force this issue every week working with Democrats in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that Republicans will hear the voices of their constituents and understand that they need to respond to this urgent demand for action.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s great frustration in the country with the dysfunctionality that has been demonstrated in Congress lately with its refusal to take very simple bipartisan, mainstream decisions that would have a positive impact on economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 So we welcome every prominent voice who joins in the effort to call on Congress to do its job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He faced a similar impasse but not as difficult.\xc2\xa0 Has he passed along any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversation to read out to you, but certainly there are a number of people in this White House, beginning with the President, who have conversations with President Clinton, and communication goes both ways, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very positive and helpful, I think.\xc2\xa0 So, again, we welcome his efforts on behalf of the American people in terms of pressing Washington to act, Congress specifically, to act to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me get back -- yes, sorry.\xc2\xa0 You are?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Devin Dwyer with ABC.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Keystone real quick, last week you said the State Department was going to be the final arbiter of this; then we heard the President on the Nebraska local television affiliate suggest that he could be involved.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify -- is he the final arbiter of that, and when might he rule on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I think I took this question last week.\xc2\xa0 But the -- this process, as we have said all along, resides -- is housed within the State Department, both as decided by -- or called upon by an executive order that predates this administration and by tradition that long predates that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The process is an open one in the sense that while State Department runs it, it is required to take in input from a variety of agencies in the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely going to take into account the criteria that the President laid out in that interview that you referenced with the television station in Omaha.\xc2\xa0 And that includes both the jobs impact, economic impact, public health impact, environmental impact.\xc2\xa0 All these criteria are very important to this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the end, we fully expect that the decision, or the resolution of this issue, the determination will reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s his administration.\xc2\xa0 It is the Obama administration, and the State Department is very much a part of the Obama administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How will he make his views known in that process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the process at all.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that the determination will reflect his views.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back and forth.\xc2\xa0 Come on -- somebody.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of the meeting today with the Secretary General of NATO?\xc2\xa0 And another question on Syria -- do you have any reaction on Syrians accusing the U.S. of -- accusing the U.S. of interference in their affairs when the State Department called for rejection to the amnesty?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- let me start with Syria.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that; maybe State Department does.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our position on Syria and the Assad regime is clear and it has not changed.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they take issue with it.\xc2\xa0 We believe that he has lost his legitimacy to rule and that the appalling violence that has been perpetrated on the Syrian people has to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what was your first question?\xc2\xa0 I got so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Rasmussen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- the President meets with the head of NATO on a relatively regular basis, and I think this is just a part of that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, NATO just completed a very important mission in Libya that we believe was executed very effectively; demonstrates the way that we can work collectively with NATO, with the United Nations, and in the case of Libya with other states, including those in the region, to bring about a positive result.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has vowed to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon, and yet the IAEA report scheduled out this week says that Iran has the sufficient information to design and produce a workable implosion nuclear device; it has all the critical steps necessary.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I got this question before.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to anticipate a report that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out yet.\xc2\xa0 I do believe it will echo our concern about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious to every one of us who have observed Iran over the past number of years that because of this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership we have created a situation where there is a high level of consensus in the international community about Iranian behavior. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is clear now to the world that Iran is the problem -- it is not the United States, it is not the international community.\xc2\xa0 And that consensus has allowed us to act to implement the most aggressive, isolating, destabilizing sanction in history.\xc2\xa0 Those sanctions have had an effect, and our overall effort to isolate and pressure Iran has an effect.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to push the diplomatic course here and to make clear to Iran that it needs to choose to uphold its obligations to the international community with regards to its nuclear program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand the -- about there have been a number of aggressive actions taken and increased sanctions, and yet, the report suggests that Iran has moved even closer to building a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 So how is it that these sanctions have been successful?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve had an effect on other things, but Iran is still now very close to building a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the report.\xc2\xa0 I do expect it will echo our concerns.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the fact that Iran continues to misbehave, if you will, is something that concerns not just the United States but the broader international community; and that that international community, because of the actions we have taken, is now focused on pressuring Iran rather than, as was the case prior to this President being in office, blaming the United States or other actors for not handling this appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the report.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that we will continue to work to pressure Iran, to isolate Iran, and we know from our own analysis as well as what the President of Iran recently said that those efforts are having an impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given the seriousness of -- and some of the things that the report is going to detail, do you expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of a report that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to ask you something else you had asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brianna\xe2\x80\x99s question about Mississippi and the personhood amendment, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment so much, but the DNC has not been shy about putting out a letter and I think an ad attacking Mitt Romney in saying he\xe2\x80\x99s extreme for supporting this amendment because it would ban some birth control, ban abortion even in the case of rape and incest.\xc2\xa0 And now interestingly, other Republicans like Haley Barbour are saying, well, maybe it does go too far. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so there is some concern out there even among some Republicans that this goes too far and could set a precedent for other states.\xc2\xa0 So does the White House share that concern at least?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, without commenting on this specific measure, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly contrary to the position this President holds in terms of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, reproductive rights and the right to choose.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specifically more to say about that from here.\xc2\xa0 The DNC that you cited I\xe2\x80\x99m sure would be willing to comment on it from their perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, another important ballot measure is in Ohio, important state as well.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President has been there a lot.\xc2\xa0 Union leaders are there today fighting it out on Issue 2 with Governor Kasich, and collective bargaining rights have been restricted by the state law.\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President spoken out on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember in some of the press conferences he\xe2\x80\x99s done that anybody has asked him about it.\xc2\xa0 I will say what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, that we -- the President strongly supports the collective bargaining rights of Americans and strongly believes that voters should vote no on 2, because that measure is contrary to his beliefs about the rights of Americans to collectively bargain.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the case of Wisconsin, it seemed like he spoke out more when the similar issue was playing out there -- we saw protests, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t chosen to go to Ohio --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99m making clear, as we have already, that -- what his position is, what our position is.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the citizens of Ohio to make their decision, because they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who actually get to cast a ballot.\xc2\xa0 But I think a lot of this has to do with what he\xe2\x80\x99s asked, the questions he\xe2\x80\x99s asked in the numerous press engagements he has.\xc2\xa0 But let me be very clear:\xc2\xa0 The President does not support the ballot initiative in Ohio that would strip away fundamental collective bargaining rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last thing on the pipeline that you were asked about -- over the weekend, environmentalists claim they had about 12,000 people outside the White House.\xc2\xa0 They seem to be gaining at least some momentum in bringing it to the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention -- that Colorado event where he was interrupted briefly a week or so ago, and he acknowledged the protestors and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you think maybe this issue is really turning on the environmental side?\xc2\xa0 And is there any chance or speculation that the White House, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a hot potato, might kick the can past the November 2012 elections so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, to the start of your question, I would simply say that the President recognizes that there are a number of critical issues involved in this decision, including climate change, impacts on public health and natural resources, as well as the economy and jobs, energy independence.\xc2\xa0 And he has acknowledged that and talked about it in a variety of settings.\xc2\xa0 The process itself, as established by an executive order signed under the previous administration, as established by long precedent prior to that, is run out of the State Department.\xc2\xa0 That process involves inputs from a lot of different agencies and departments within the executive branch, and it would be -- it will be driven by the criteria the President has discussed and which I just mentioned. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That process is ongoing, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the State Department on timing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Senator Schumer was quoted earlier today in talking about the super committee, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the super committee is going to succeed because our Republican colleagues have said no net revenues.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that skepticism that the super committee will be able to reach a deal by the deadline?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes the super committee can and should adopt a balanced approach to long-term and medium-term deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 How you do that is not nearly as complicated as we might expect.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been laid out now by a variety of different commissions that have looked at this, bipartisan commissions, as well as in the President\xe2\x80\x99s own proposals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He remains hopeful that the super committee will take that approach because we need to address this issue.\xc2\xa0 That was the idea when Congress decided to create the super committee through the legislation, through the balanced -- the Budget Control Act, and we certainly hope that the committee will act accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the gridlock that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen coming out of these negotiations so far, would you describe him as being optimistic that they will be able to reach a deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is -- remains hopeful that the super committee will respond not just to all of the serious studies into this that have been done on this issue and policy examinations through bipartisan commissions and the work that his administration has done and the negotiations he had with the Speaker of House and act accordingly in a balanced way, in a way that includes revenues as well as entitlement reforms, because that\xe2\x80\x99s not just the way he believes it should be done, and the way that the experts who have -- the bipartisan commissions that have studied this say it should be done, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the way the American people say it should be done because, look, these are solvable problems, but they require a willingness to compromise.\xc2\xa0 They require everybody to participate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by participating that means that the burden has to be spread evenly.\xc2\xa0 It cannot -- when you talk about -- I guess you began by asking about Republicans who insist on no revenue.\xc2\xa0 Well, what does that mean in practice?\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the proposals that do this without any revenue, and you know what it means, it means putting a big boulder on the shoulders of senior citizens.\xc2\xa0 It means asking sacrifice only from the middle class or from seniors or from families with disabled children.\xc2\xa0 It means dramatic cuts in education or research -- and protects, therefore, the wealthiest Americans who have, unlike the middle class, done exceptionally well in the last decade and over the last 30 years, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the difference between the share of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth held by the very wealthiest Americans compared to the rest of the country -- that gap grow dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a balanced approach is clearly the way to go.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully the super committee will come together around a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 And if it does, that will be good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It will be good for Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think Congress\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings might actually get above single digits if they act accordingly.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s good politics.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be away during sort of these final negotiation days.\xc2\xa0 How will he make sure that he navigates being abroad and at the same time have a hand in these final days of negotiations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about how this process has worked.\xc2\xa0 Many weeks ago now the President put forward his concrete detailed proposals for how he believes the super committee should act.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in this process came at the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Everyone in Congress knows what his views are, and he put forward proposals that they are welcome to take as their own and adopt as their own either exactly or roughly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So beyond that, the President obviously is capable no matter where he is to engage with the White House, with the administration, with Congress, and will do that as necessary.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, Congress has an obligation to act.\xc2\xa0 The super committee has a legislated obligation to act, and Congress should act.\xc2\xa0 There are no seats on that committee for the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 This is a congressional responsibility, and the President has already made his views clear, again, with an approach that is balanced that includes some tough choices on entitlements, includes asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit extra so that we can move this country forward in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair to everyone.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly hopes Congress will take him up and act accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on that question.\xc2\xa0 Another benchmark -- the European benchmark was the behavior of the super committee.\xc2\xa0 We have two crises in the world, and we will be reminded after the European crisis of last week and Thanksgiving coming up that there\xe2\x80\x99s also an American debt crisis.\xc2\xa0 How would you compare that?\xc2\xa0 What do you expect from Congress?\xc2\xa0 Doing at least as good as the Europeans?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud being a European how we move forward, but at least we move forward.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Bumpy, complicated and so on.\xc2\xa0 But there are decisions and somehow there\xe2\x80\x99s progress made, so it is very slow.\xc2\xa0 So I would like to ask what you expect from Congress, doing at least as good as --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I think I just addressed what the President expects from Congress or hopes will happen in Congress.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the comparative is one I would want to make or particularly useful.\xc2\xa0 The President just spent some time at the G20 working with his European counterparts and helping them and advising them as they deal with their own crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He happens to have a fair amount of experience in dealing with a financial crisis, as does Secretary Geithner, who was there, and whose expertise I think is considered a valuable resource to tape by the Europeans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, we in the United States are focusing on the things that we can control, the things that we should do to grow our economy, create jobs, as well as get our medium- and long-term deficit and debt under control.\xc2\xa0 How we do that is pretty clear, and it can be done in a bipartisan way through measures that are the kinds of measures that have traditionally garnered bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 If everyone in Congress puts politics aside and puts party aside and focuses on what the very people who elected them are demanding Congress focus on, which is taking sensible action to grow the economy, create jobs and deal with these longer-term issues in a way that is fair and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t place all of the burden on seniors or other vulnerable Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question which I asked you a few weeks -- or a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 Would it be helpful -- or rather not helpful -- if European leaders make their feelings or their views known?\xc2\xa0 Of course, this country is afraid that the European crisis may break down the economy of this country.\xc2\xa0 But the same is true in the other direction, that Europeans are afraid if Americans are not solving their debt crisis that we might feel negative consequences from that.\xc2\xa0 So, again, on one hand Congress is a sovereign body and normally you don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with these sovereign parliamentary bodies, but from the point of view of the White House, would it be helpful -- this administration has made it known what it thinks and hears about the European crisis.\xc2\xa0 Should Europe do the same vice versa and would it be helpful?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dictate -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this President wants to dictate -- how other countries or other leaders should speak or view events in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the things we can do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pushing Congress to do the things it can do to deal with our challenges -- the near-term challenge of growing the economy and creating jobs; the medium- and long-term challenge of getting our fiscal house in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President has made clear for a number of years now, and as was adopted in the communiqu\xc3\xa9 by the G20, we believe the whole -- the global economy should be, and all the industrialized and emerging countries should be focused in the same way on both of those issues:\xc2\xa0 the need to grow, and the need to deal with their long-term fiscal stability.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re taking here.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re pushing Congress to adopt.\xc2\xa0 And that overall approach is one that the President discussed with his counterparts at the G20.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and then Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the super committee.\xc2\xa0 Moody\xe2\x80\x99s has threatened another downgrade if they don\xe2\x80\x99t come to an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President would commit to vetoing anything that would avoid the sequester.\xc2\xa0 In other words, if the super committee can\xe2\x80\x99t act -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s a sequester -- there\xe2\x80\x99s already talk about legislation that would try to soften it or get around it.\xc2\xa0 Is he determined that either they should get an agreement or have the sequester?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Congress passed this legislation not that many weeks ago, and created the sequester precisely because it was supposed to be onerous and designed to hold Congress\xe2\x80\x99s feet to the fire and force action.\xc2\xa0 We think Congress ought to focus on its job and that it ought to move according to that legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this movie before.\xc2\xa0 I mean, triggers can be untriggered.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the trigger was designed as an incentive for Congress to do its job.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.\xc2\xa0 And the cuts that would happen under a sequester, if the trigger were pulled, are onerous for a reason.\xc2\xa0 And so we think that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that Congress act, because the ability to move on a fast track, for example, the ability to do something significant on medium- and long-term deficit and debt control, is enshrined within the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 And Congress ought to take advantage of that, and ought to do more than is outlined --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the process.\xc2\xa0 I think to declare now that Congress will fail before it\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to, I think is not helpful.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Congress has all it needs in terms of guidelines and outlines in the kind of policy decisions it needs to make at the committee level to do this.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity here to well overshoot the goal outlined by the legislation, in terms of long-term deficit and debt reduction, as the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan does.\xc2\xa0 And we hope and -- well, we hope that Congress will take that up and do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject -- just a question on another subject.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow is a year from the election.\xc2\xa0 Could you just describe President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-line message to the American people as to why he deserves a second term?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly will let him do that when he\xe2\x80\x99s asked.\xc2\xa0 I think that a couple of things are clear.\xc2\xa0 The actions this President took, the decisions he made -- some of them very difficult -- stopped what was already a catastrophic situation from becoming a Great Depression. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We now know that this economy contracted at 9 percent, almost, in the fourth quarter of 2008; over 7 percent in the final two quarters of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 We know it lost 8 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 We know it was losing close to 800,000 a month when he was sworn into office.\xc2\xa0 Because of the actions that he took and the decisions he made, there have been 20 straight months of private sector job creation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The economy has been growing instead of contracting.\xc2\xa0 The automobile industry continues to exist in this country, with all the jobs attached to it, and is now doing very well in many cases. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I could spend a lot more time on what he has accomplished.\xc2\xa0 But most importantly, he believes the work is not done, and we need to continue to take the kind of positive action that will grow this economy, because what we have so far is not good enough.\xc2\xa0 The level of unemployment we have is not good enough.\xc2\xa0 The pace of economic growth we have had is not good enough.\xc2\xa0 The hole that we -- this country was in, as a result of the great recession, was deep.\xc2\xa0 And it will take -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into it overnight, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t climb out of it overnight.\xc2\xa0 But we have been moving forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we cannot -- and this President believes we should not -- go back to the very policies that led us into the hole.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you just look, I think it pays to remember -- because we all tend to look at the present and the future -- remember what it was like in January and February, March of 2009, and what people were talking about in terms of the economic Armageddon that we were facing.\xc2\xa0 Look at the charts that show dramatic shrinking of the economy, compared to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last 20 months or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we need to do more.\xc2\xa0 We can do more.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to doing more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 One, it looks like the Senate is getting ready to actually pass a bipartisan version of the veterans jobs bill.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what you attribute the pending success in this area to when there\xe2\x80\x99s been so little in other areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have been pushing Congress, specifically the Senate, to pass the individual components of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 The assistance to veterans is part of that.\xc2\xa0 The incentivizing of business to hire veterans has been part of that.\xc2\xa0 And we would welcome, as we would the passage of any one of these provisions, the passage of this one, if it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that -- putting on my political analyst hat -- I think that there are signs that Republicans are hearing the frustration out in the country about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunctionality, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to act on the things that matter most to the American people.\xc2\xa0 Again, the data is clear on this point.\xc2\xa0 So maybe this bodes well for the future.\xc2\xa0 Maybe this means that Congress will take up and act on some of the other provisions of the American Jobs Act, that maybe it would even reconsider some of its decisions previous to now.\xc2\xa0 Hope springs eternal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I do know is that this President will continue to focus on this; will continue to press Congress to act; will continue to act in ways that he can through his executive authority to advance the priorities of the American people, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Congress to act when it so infrequently acts on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully Congress will come around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s veterans, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to vote against veterans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to vote against the American people -- which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that sometimes Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t vote against the American people, or in this case, those who vote against the kind of job creation and economic growth that the American people are asking for -- paid for entirely without adding a dime to our deficit; paid for in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelmingly supported by the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So sometimes members of Congress vote that way.\xc2\xa0 But I think in the end it becomes increasingly difficult to vote against the very things the American people are asking Congress to vote for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is scheduled to go to Australia shortly.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s canceled that trip twice before.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason for the Australians to feel at all nervous that he will not be appearing in Australia?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We have no scheduling changes anticipated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend -- this is a nice segue after you just said the Congress sometimes votes against the American people.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, the Speaker said that his relationship with the President, since they played golf this summer, has turned, \xe2\x80\x9ca little bit frosty.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a characterization you all would agree with?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has had and I think continues to have a solid relationship with the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 They spend a lot of time together in private trying to do something big for the American people; a so-called grand bargain to achieve substantial balanced, long-term deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the Speaker genuinely wanted to do that, but that in the end it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible politically for him to do that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He still believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for Congress to take action collectively, in a bipartisan way, for long-term, medium-term deficit and debt reduction, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying in response to questions about the super committee.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to work with Speaker Boehner and I think continues to have a good relationship with him.\xc2\xa0 The issue here, though, is not about personal friendship, it\xe2\x80\x99s about doing the work that the American people are asking their elected leaders in Washington to do.\xc2\xa0 And in the case of what we just talked about, the American people overwhelmingly are asking Washington to act on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President hopes that Speaker Boehner, Minority Leader McConnell and others will join him in taking the kind of action that the American people want taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been since the two spoke?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- I know they spoke when the President called after the passage of the free trade agreements, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken since.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we are around that one-year timeframe now for elections, what is the White House, this administration, doing along with Justice in working with the DCCC in reference to anti-voter suppression efforts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that Justice is the place to go to have that question answered.\xc2\xa0 I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been activity on that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it at that, that I would refer to the Justice Department on those.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, James Clyburn is now being named by the DCCC as the head of their new anti-voter suppression efforts.\xc2\xa0 And Marcia Fudge has said that, right now, the voter suppression issue is the number-one civil rights issue in this country.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rank that particularly, but I would say that voter suppression is a terrible and wrong thing.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it just -- disenfranchisement is -- I mean, the franchise is the essence of citizenship and of being an American.\xc2\xa0 So we obviously believe that Americans ought to have free access to -- I mean, easy access to voting, easy access to participating in the vote, in the franchise.\xc2\xa0 So as a general issue, we are concerned about it, but in terms of specific actions I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Justice Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, all the way --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President cited earlier today that the parts of the American Jobs Act that are really popular, that deal with veterans benefits -- does the President believe that the country would be even better served if young men and women were less likely in the future to spend so much time in war zones?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer it this way:\xc2\xa0 This President is committed, as he promised to be when he was running for the office, to ending the war in Iraq responsibly and bringing those troops home; to, as he made clear when he announced his policy in Afghanistan, to -- after surging up forces there, to drawing down the surge forces, which is happening now, and transferring lead security authority over to the Afghan security forces by 2014.\xc2\xa0 And he is keeping all of his commitments.\xc2\xa0 That has been -- the overall impact of that has been a dramatic reduction in the number of Americans serving in war zones since he took office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The focus, though, is in getting the policy right, and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq or Afghanistan or more broadly, he\xe2\x80\x99s very committed to doing just that, to making sure we have the right policies, the most responsible policies, and the policies that deliver the best results.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the view he takes, and this goes back to conversations we had when Libya was in its early days and people asked me about the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach with regard to all of the changes that have happened in the Arab Spring has been not what satisfies the critics today or this week, but where do we want to be in terms of American interests six months, a year and 10 years from now?\xc2\xa0 What gives us -- what policy choices give us the best chance of success in terms of protecting and enhancing American national security interests down the road?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken from the beginning, even before he was sworn into office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Military question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Connie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any thoughts on the general who was fired for speaking out about Afghanistan, Karzai?\xc2\xa0 Actually what he said was supported by many Americans.\xc2\xa0 And also Leon Panetta\xe2\x80\x99s statements about military cuts, do you have anything on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on the first issue for you.\xc2\xa0 I think in general we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear in terms of the sequester that those cuts are onerous and we believe too deep.\xc2\xa0 But that was the whole design.\xc2\xa0 It was supposed to force the Congress to act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The cuts that were put forward that the President laid out in April, obviously, he believes are the right ones and that continues to be his position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:32 P.M.
