b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:22 P.M. HAST</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for getting together for a couple minutes here.</p>\n<p>One thing that wasn\'t immediately apparent during the President\'s remarks today is shortly before his remarks he had a secure conference call with General Jones, with John Brennan, with Tom Donilon, wherein he got an update on the review.\xc2\xa0 As he announced today he obviously formally signed the terms of reference for review, which has been undergoing here since Sunday and sent those out to the agencies as a formal matter.</p>\n<p>But in the context of that discussion General Jones and John and Tom updated the President on some of the new developments in the review overnight.\xc2\xa0 The President, in a spirit of candor and transparency, wanted to make sure that the American people were aware of what he learned in the context of this review, and that\'s why he wanted to go out today and did so in relatively short order.</p>\n<p>The fact is that I think as the President made clear in his statement it is now clear to us that there are bits and pieces of information that were in the possession of the U.S. government in advance of the Christmas Day attack -- the attempted Christmas Day attack that had they been assessed and correlated could have led to a much broader picture and allowed us to disrupt the attack or certainly to know much more about the alleged attacker in such a way as to ensure that he was on, as the President suggested in his statement, a no-fly list.</p>\n<p>I would just say the some of that information was incomplete or partial in nature.\xc2\xa0 I think that it was in some instances about the individual in question and his plans, some of it was about al Qaeda and its plans, some of it was about potential attacks during the holiday period.\xc2\xa0 It was not obvious or readily apparent that all of it spoke to this attack, but in fact we believe it did.</p>\n<p>So with that as kind of an opening or an introduction here, let me open it up to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he learn something today that he didn\'t know yesterday?\xc2\xa0 Couldn\'t he have drawn the same conclusion when he came out yesterday, or was there something new he heard today that made him solidify that conclusion?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there was something new that he learned, several of us learned about it last night, late last night here.\xc2\xa0 We worked on it overnight and in the morning.\xc2\xa0 We thought it was important that the President be briefed on it by General Jones and by John and Tom, which he was.\xc2\xa0 And then that\'s what led the President to go out today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any better sense of what that was?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think I just gave you a sense of it, Peter.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President gave some indication of it today, too.\xc2\xa0 It had to do with information that was in possession of the government at the time that spoke to both where the suspect had been, what some of his thinking and plans were, what some plans of al Qaeda were, and the fact that if this all were correlated in a way that allowed us to get a bigger and brighter picture -- as, frankly, the intelligence community has done very, very effectively earlier this year; for example, on the case of Najibullah Zazi and in the case of David Coleman Headley -- I think if it were correlated in such a way as those were I think it would have been a different outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He spoke of systemic and human failure.\xc2\xa0 Could you be more specific about what the human failures were?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into any more specifics than the President did on the human failure.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to systemic failure, I mean, the question really is as this information is available in analytical channels, how are we making sure that it\'s available in a different databases.\xc2\xa0 And so those are exactly the kind of questions that the review is going to look at.</p>\n<p>You know, we\'re dealing with a series of watch list policies and procedures, and, frankly, assumptions that have been with us now for a couple years.\xc2\xa0 As I think we\'ve indicated to each of you in individual conversations and as I indicated to you last night, the President is constantly demanding that we challenge those assumptions and that we take a hard look at whether the systems in place are sufficient to the task at hand.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s exactly what the review will do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He says people need to be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 What is talking about in terms of accountability?\xc2\xa0 Is he talking people get fired for when this type of thing happens?\xc2\xa0 People get reassigned?\xc2\xa0 What kind of accountability is he talking about?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was very clear.\xc2\xa0 I think the words he uses, that he intends to demand accountability at the highest levels.\xc2\xa0 It remains to be seen what that means exactly; I\'m not going to prejudge the review.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President is making very clear that he holds us to a very high standard, he holds himself to a very high standard and that\'s what he intends to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where was DNI in all of this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the whole point of DNI and the creation of it was centralized intelligence and taking this and having everything coming in, in one place, and having sort of, you know, overseeing it.\xc2\xa0 Yet I\'ve not heard the words "Dennis Blair" come out of your mouth at all in these last three days.\xc2\xa0 So is he just -- is this part of the review, like, what role are they playing?\xc2\xa0 Are they going to be part of this review?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Frankly, as I indicated to you all last night that the interagency has been up and been working.\xc2\xa0 The DNI is a key part of the interagency process on that.\xc2\xa0 The NCTC is housed in the DNI and that\'s a key piece of this puzzle.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, I think as you\'ve seen, as I just suggested, over the course of this year there has been tremendous advances as a result of the intelligence community, as a result of the DNI.\xc2\xa0 And as NCTC, I gave you just two examples; there\'s countless others that I\'m not going to talk to you about, but about which I think the President is very proud of the intelligence community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is the clog, whatever you want to call it, where things got clogged up, didn\'t get correlated is here.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to prejudge exactly where it is.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s, as the President suggested in his remarks today, that there are a series of shortcomings.\xc2\xa0 Not only was it that this information was available to a component of the intelligence community, but also that there\'s other issues that we want to resolve within the intelligence community within the broader interagency as a whole.</p>\n<p>So I don\'t want to leave the impression that there\'s one challenge here.\xc2\xa0 I think that what we want to make sure is that given the multitude of information that we\'re able to get our hands on now, that we\'re correlating it in the best possible way.\xc2\xa0 And the DNI plays a fundamental role.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, you know, I\'ve spent some time on that legislation.\xc2\xa0 That was a key reform out of the 9/11 Commission.\xc2\xa0 As you know it\'s been a long time -- had been a longtime issue that Lee Hamilton, who is a student of the intelligence community, a very ardent student of it, had encouraged that there be an overarching mechanism that demanded the sharing of information.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s happening.\xc2\xa0 And the question is whether the policies and procedures that we\'ve had in place are sufficient or whether they need to be updated, and that\'s what the review is going to find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What more can he expect to get in this preliminary look that he wants by Thursday that he doesn\'t have now?\xc2\xa0 What are the other things that are out there that could possibly be resolved in the next day or so?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'re pulsing it for all the information and intelligence that\'s out there about -- that could have been available at the time.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s a great opportunity to learn more about where we can get information that could be correlated and pushed more effectively into any particular review.</p>\n<p>But, you know, Peter, it\'s difficult to know exactly what\'s out there.\xc2\xa0 If we did we wouldn\'t have to do the review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he set Thursday as the first deadline?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 For two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, because he wants to act with urgency, and he indicated that in the statement today.\xc2\xa0 Two, because, frankly, under General Jones and John Brennan we\'ve been pulsing this system very aggressively since Friday.\xc2\xa0 And so a lot of this information is being correlated, being pulled together, being looked at now.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to make sure that we have a short fuse in terms of looking at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just at the moment, though, when the email crossed on my BlackBerry that he was going to give a statement I was on the phone with NCTC and they were still arguing that Abdul Muttalib was properly categorized?\xc2\xa0 Was he?\xc2\xa0 And if not, is there a major conflict here?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are they that far behind where all you guys were in your meeting earlier today?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\'s part of the issue that we want to resolve here.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, a lot of the intelligence that we\'re drawing on now is intelligence that NCTC brought together.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think it\'s indicative of a conflict or a misunderstanding.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s just indicative of the fact that everybody is looking very hard at this, as I think NCTC told you, we\'re talking about gigantic databases with a huge number of people and information in it.\xc2\xa0 And what we want to make sure that we\'re doing is that we\'re targeting that information and our resources on that information that\'s most useful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it still your position that he should have been in the broadest category and not on any of the watch lists, narrower watch lists?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just associate myself with what the President had to say about what he learned overnight and then what he told the American people today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t Secretary Napolitano acknowledge any systemic failures on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 She didn\'t acknowledge any problems.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you heard the President talk to today -- I think on your station on Monday morning she did indicate that it was her assessment that it was a failure.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President said today was that as Secretary Napolitano had said, that after the point that it became clear that this fellow intended to do harm to us that everything worked the way it should.\xc2\xa0 And the President enumerated that I think pretty clearly.</p>\n<p>The question is what happened before then.\xc2\xa0 And the President and Secretary Napolitano have made clear that there is systemic failure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she didn\'t make that clear on Sunday and she also didn\'t ask for any accountability.\xc2\xa0 I mean, why did it take until Tuesday after the incident for anyone to talk about accountability?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think I\'d have to take a harder look at what she said specifically in the six interviews she gave on Monday morning, when she made it very clear that there was a failure in this instance.\xc2\xa0 And as it relates to accountability, I think the President was quite clear on that and frankly he\'s been quite clear on that throughout his administration -- as he has been on transparency, and that\'s really the principle that governed getting out there today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the failures -- when you talk about the human failure, is he saying that the system itself failed, or that proper procedures weren\'t followed?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 He\'s saying that it looks like there was both human and systemic failure and that we are going to conduct this review to make sure that it doesn\'t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the system may need to actually be changed?\xc2\xa0 It\'s not that the proper procedures weren\'t followed and had they been this wouldn\'t have happened, it\'s that the system itself is going to need to change?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It\'s the whole point of the review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you said you couldn\'t verify al Qaeda\'s claim, taking responsibility for this.\xc2\xa0 But with the new information overnight it sounds like you maybe have verified their claim?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not -- I\'m never going to verify anything al Qaeda says and I\'m not in a position to suggest that we know conclusively that they were for it, that they planned it.</p>\n<p>I do think, as the President indicated yesterday, we\'re not going to rest until we find those who aided this.\xc2\xa0 And I think as I just suggested to you today, that some of the new information that we\'ve developed overnight does suggest that there was some linkage there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any assurance that this kind of thing won\'t arise again before this review is complete?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 By "this kind of thing," what is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That systemic failure would lead to another plot being foiled or is there someone else in the system that you\'re identifying or that the agencies are looking at?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Frankly, I think the thousands of dedicated professionals in the intelligence and law enforcement communities are looking at a variety of threats every day.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s to their great credit that the overwhelming number of those, vast majority of those are stopped.\xc2\xa0 And I just gave you two examples of instances that we have discussed publicly.\xc2\xa0 But there are dozens and dozens that we will not discuss publicly.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s to their great credit that it\'s happened that way.</p>\n<p>As it relates to whether I can give you any assurance, I think the bottom line is we are pressing this issue very, very aggressively to ensure that it doesn\'t happen again.\xc2\xa0 As the President indicated in his remarks today there is no -- even when all of our best intelligence and policies and procedures work effectively there\'s no guarantee that we\'ll be successful.\xc2\xa0 But that simple fact should serve as a motivating factor for all of us, to ensure that we\'re being that much more aggressive and that much more intent on stopping these guys who have demonstrated time and again that they have an intent to undertake this kind of stuff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Napolitano, is the President unhappy with her comment the other day, or is he attempting to help her today in going out there and sort of reframing and making sure people have a sense that he thinks things failed as well?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It\'s difficult for me to characterize the President\'s thinking.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s very -- as he indicated today, I think that he\'s very appreciative of the multitude of people who are working in this area of intelligence, homeland security, law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 And so I think, frankly, that he appreciates all the work that she is doing and has been doing, as he appreciates all the work that everybody in her agency is doing and all the intel folks are doing.</p>\n<p>But that doesn\'t mean that we don\'t owe it to them and to the American people to take a hard look at it when the policies and procedures that are in place fail to result in the outcome that we all expect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have confidence in her?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The new information you\'ve developed -- is it just to the Christmas Day attack, or is there some reason to believe from this that this is a wider threat?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No reason to believe that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication that he\'s connected at all to militants under -- any other militants under U.S. scrutiny?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you thought if the information was put together that you would have a different outcome.\xc2\xa0 Can you say -- are you saying definitively that if that information was correlated he would have put on a no-fly list?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\'d just associate myself with what the President said about this today, that had it been more effectively shared that it\'s conceivable that there would have been a different outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t say "conceivable," he went way beyond saying it\'s "conceivable."\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t he say --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Then allow me to continue to associate myself with his remarks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the watch list review, has there been a person selected to oversee the -- yesterday you said that --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that will be overseen by Brennan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we switch to Major Hasan here a minute?\xc2\xa0 In the same way that you have talked about the importance the President wants with transparency regarding new bits of information -- which appear to be about Yemen, with our terror suspect, is -- at some point is it going to be important for the government to be transparent about Major Hasan\'s connections possibly to the same groups of people?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems like you continue to put Major Hasan in this other category.\xc2\xa0 And as we\'re learning more and more does it seem to be that we should be?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t, but you do.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that the President has been very transparent about this and continues to look at this.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve just worked through the review on Fort Hood and what we knew, what developed on the systems that should have been -- that are in place there.\xc2\xa0 And that review --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you worry that there were some similar intelligence failures regarding Major Hasan\'s contacts?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think that the challenge for us in this system where we\'re getting a multitude of intelligence as a result of the excellent work of our intelligence analysts in the field, as a result of excellent analysis from all sorts of other agencies -- from the military, from our State Department diplomats and others.\xc2\xa0 Our challenge is to make sure that it\'s correlated and shared across agencies in a way that people can draw on that to draw the appropriate conclusions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s as true on Zazi and Headley as it is on anything else, including Hasan.</p>\n<p>So bottom line is we are working aggressively to ensure that all this information that we\'re dragging in through a variety of channels is used most effectively.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be true on all these cases.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This watch list system was devised under the Bush administration, as you point out.\xc2\xa0 Was there anything actively done during the past year to review that watch list system to see if it\'s -- what might have needed to be done to it?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I have not done any review of the existing watch list system.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that others have, but I\'m certainly happy to ask around on that.\xc2\xa0 The point -- I don\'t remember suggesting -- as you suggested I suggested --that this was devised under the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 I said it\'s been devised over the course of many years.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that we are up against a threat that has metastasized in many ways and we want to make sure that the assumptions that govern the decisions about it do keep up with that threat.</p>\n<p>So the fact is that as we\'ve taken on these challenges there\'s no question we see them differently today than maybe some others saw them a year ago.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that the challenge for us isn\'t one focused on Washington, but rather one focused on the dynamic threat that we face and making sure that the institutions we have in place are ready for that threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, this is kind of for you logistically when this new deadline comes on Thursday, can we expect to see the President come out again publicly and talk about this on Thursday itself?\xc2\xa0 What do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve said previously, we reserve the right to screw up your day at a moment\'s notice, so I\'d just stay tuned.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CNN is reporting that the suspect\'s father met in Abuja with the CIA station chief there.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- these days?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is -- we just spent a little bit of time with him, as we have been doing on a regular basis throughout this trip.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is, as I think many of us are, grateful for the opportunity to be with his wife and his kids.\xc2\xa0 I think that he\'s also very mindful of the fact that we continue to be under threat by al Qaeda and its affiliates and I think he\'s very mindful of the fact that there\'s thousands of Americans traveling who are going through additional hassles in their travel as a result.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\'s -- just to sum up, I think he\'s grateful for the opportunity to be with his wife and kids, his two daughters, and I think he\'s grateful to be with friends, but I think he\'s also very mindful of the fact that there is a series of challenges that are as -- that are as present and upfront for him here as they are back in Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was consideration ever given to breaking away, to leaving here to go back to D.C. to deal with this?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Still no.\xc2\xa0 My answer yesterday was no; the answer today is no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say something about Yemen, thinking about what happens next in Yemen?\xc2\xa0 Is there something we should be watching for in terms more kinetic activity, more overt activity?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You know, one of the things that as an administration we\'ve done over the course of the last six or seven months is dramatically increase the attention on Yemen.\xc2\xa0 As a result of increased pressure on al Qaeda in South Asia, we\'re mindful of the fact that al Qaeda will want to develop additional operations and locations and Yemen has been one of those.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard us say before -- you\'ve heard Robert say and you\'ve heard the President say, including up at West Point, that we are going to keep the pressure on al Qaeda and its affiliates -- be that in East Africa or the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, Southeast Asia, or as I indicated earlier, right here at home in terms of the Zazi and Hedley business --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- wasn\'t that a criticism of --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 As I was saying -- so we\'ve increased our -- dramatically increased our attention to it.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about it quite a bit, and I think it\'s fair to say -- with trips there of important administration officials -- we\'ve underscored to the Yemeni government that we\'re strongly supportive of their efforts against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and others that wish not only them harm, but wish us harm.</p>\n<p>Exactly what form that increased support will take is -- obviously includes things like training and increased military and economic assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be a priority for us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- story that six Yemenis were returned just last week from Guantanamo Bay to Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Is there enough faith in the Yemeni government to not -- those guys won\'t join back with al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You know, we\'ve been obviously working this through very aggressively.\xc2\xa0 We\'re making decisions based on a range of intelligence that we have and we\'re obviously dealing with a situation that we\'ve inherited as it relates to our ability to hold certain individuals.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re confident that any transfers that we\'re making are being made not only consistent with our national security interests but also consistent with what we consider to be a fundamental national security interest in closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that some of us were struck by the fact when al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula itself was formed it was the conglomeration of two separate al Qaeda affiliates -- when it was formed, one of the recruiting and motivational tools that it used in its initial announcement to generate sympathy for its cause as well as recruits was the facility at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>So we continue to feel that this is in our national security interest to close.\xc2\xa0 We feel that the way we\'re closing it is advancing our national security interest goals, and that will continue to be the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on that, you make this -- everybody is going to get reviewed and Yemen\'s ability to handle the transfer of a Gitmo -- of a Yemeni Gitmo detainee will be taken into account before --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what the law says at the moment; that\'s exactly what the President made clear in the announcement of the review of each case last January; and that\'s what, frankly, we\'ve done with experienced intelligence and prosecutorial professionals over the course of this year --going through each of these cases with a fine-tooth comb.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been calls for\xc2\xa0 -- McCain, Lieberman and Graham issued a joint statement, wrote a letter to the President saying -- called on any Yemeni nationals, transfers from Gitmo -- that\'s sort of a moot point because you wouldn\'t be releasing them if you thought they were going to become terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- is that the way you responded, is that fair --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say what our policy is.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had the opportunity to catch up with that letter, but our policy is, as consistent with the law, that we\'ll make transfers; we\'ll notify Congress of the transfers; that we\'ll make transfers consistent with our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that each of those that we have done so far enhances our national security.</p>\n<p>I am aware of a lot of people pointing back at the way the transfers were handled under the Bush administration, that apparently they have some concerns about that.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear many of those concerns at the time, but there were obviously hundreds and hundreds of detainees that were transferred under the old regime.</p>\n<p>We are, as I suggested, going through this with a fine-tooth comb.\xc2\xa0 But I also just hasten to add the bigger picture here which is that we believe closing Gitmo is in the national security interest of the country for the reasons I\'ve just outlined.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is today the first time that the President spoke to General Jones since coming here?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, he speaks on a fairly regular basis with General Jones.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About how many hours a day is he devoting to work while he\'s out here?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Boy, I don\'t have a full -- I don\'t have full visibility.\xc2\xa0 I know that he\'s certainly dedicating a couple hours a day to our stuff, but he\'s also obviously in continual consultation with and contact with the economic and domestic policy teams.\xc2\xa0 But from his daily intelligence brief, the regular NCTC updates, the regular Sit Room intel updates that I outlined to you guys yesterday, and our regular conversations with him, it\'s certainly several hours a day with us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t he be spending more time if he were back in Washington on this?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Spending more time?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this issue, if he were back in Washington?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, he\'s dedicating a lot of time to it now, Chip, so it\'s difficult for me to kind of judge, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 We\'re in constant contact with him now not only in the very formal channels that we indicated yesterday, but also in other ways while we\'re here.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ve no reason -- I\'ve no way to judge that, but by the same token I also have every confidence that he is right in the middle of this effort right now.\xc2\xa0 He\'s leading the response.\xc2\xa0 And I think the speed with which we responded to the developments in the update call today demonstrates exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could make sure I understood a word you used -- you said a couple times, you said "pulsing" the system -- is that what you said, "pulsing"?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Pulsing, yes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way we say it in Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:23 P.M.
