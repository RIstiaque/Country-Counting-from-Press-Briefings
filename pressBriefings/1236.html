EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A few questions on START.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us your updated sense of where we stand?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that it has -- still has the votes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The White House believes that before Congress leaves town, that the Senate will ratify the New START treaty.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you confident ultimately you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the votes or right now is it still in play?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, the President and the Vice President continue to communicate with senators in order to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you heard last week I think a pretty compelling endorsement from General Cartwright, the Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs, speak to one of the misconceptions about the impact of preamble language on our missile defense posture.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been dealt with rather effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe were asked over the weekend whether Senator Kyl or Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s opposition impacted passage and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I have not talked to anybody here who had them as \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d votes at any point in this process anyway.\xc2\xa0 So their statements in my mind don\xe2\x80\x99t impact passage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the concerns that you\xe2\x80\x99re still hearing at this point from senators who have not committed are ones that you consider to be substantive in nature?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here before, there have been 18 committee hearings on this; a thousand questions asked and answered; a treaty that\xe2\x80\x99s been on the Internet for eight months.\xc2\xa0 If there are senators with substantive questions, we can have anybody that they want to speak with them about those questions.\xc2\xa0 We feel very confident that all of their questions have good answers. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, General Cartwright is the expert on the chair -- on the Joint Chiefs staff on missile defense.\xc2\xa0 And when he stands in this room and says that there are no concerns with preamble language on missile defense, that\'s a weighty endorsement for what\xe2\x80\x99s in the treaty.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s week ahead, as best you can tell right now?\xc2\xa0 Specifically -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The question I got from the President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d signing and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, my sense, without having a specific time at this point, is that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d will be signed -- the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d would be signed by the President likely on Wednesday morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Morning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Morning.\xc2\xa0 So that gives you a sense of the parameters of our week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that -- I don\'t know the size of the event, but I think there are a lot of people that are interested in seeing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Robert, just a little bit more on START, Senator Kyl, he said over the weekend that, \xe2\x80\x9csnookered on missile defense, tactical nuclear weapons verification.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not worried he\xe2\x80\x99s going to influence some other Republicans to vote against this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think his views on that aspect of our treaty have been very well known.\xc2\xa0 Again, the expert in the U.S. government on those issues was -- is General Cartwright.\xc2\xa0 And I think he was very clear -- and I think there was an amendment over the weekend to strike some of the language in the preamble, and it lost fairly convincingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, again, I think if there are those with questions about the impact of or the effects of any aspect of our policy as it relates to the START treaty, there are many people in this government that can answer those questions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our strong belief -- again, as enumerated by General Cartwright -- and I think as you see when we were in Lisbon as NATO endorsed our missile defense policy; at the same time they\xe2\x80\x99re arguing for the ratification of the START treaty.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the treaty and missile defense are not in competition with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one other thing?\xc2\xa0 Bill Richardson is in North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting to hear back from him?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to get a report on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s some -- he may have gotten an agreement --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is on a private trip.\xc2\xa0 It is not one that is in any way sanctioned by the U.S. government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sanctioned by CNN.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with the move on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s message to service members who may be serving right now who are in the closet, gay and lesbian, or service members who have been discharged for being openly gay or lesbian?\xc2\xa0 As of Wednesday morning, can people who are gay and lesbian in the service be open about who they are?\xc2\xa0 As of Wednesday morning, can those who have been discharged reapply?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Jake, I think there are a series of implementation and legal issues that lawyers in this building as well as in the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice are working through, and obviously working through a longer and larger implementation policy process once the President signs the repeal into law.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- not want to be in a position to at this point give that legal advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for START, Condi Rice, the former Secretary of State, has come out in favor of the START treaty but she has said with caveats that the Senate should make clear and in an accompanying resolution that the preamble language that some think links missile defense with this treaty, it should be made even clearer in this resolution that there is no linkage.\xc2\xa0 Because she says sometimes in her experience the Russians have taken language, even non-binding preamble language like in the START treaty, and used it to justify an argument or a point of view.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any issue were the Senate to take that sort of step?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, Jake, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to look at the wording of a resolution.\xc2\xa0 Again, we -- our view and the view of not just those that negotiated the treaty but more importantly those that are our implementers of the missile policy, missile defense policy, believe strongly that the language does in no way inhibit any of our actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t -- haven\xe2\x80\x99t Russians leaders made comments indicating that they interpret it differently?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our policy on missile defense and protecting Europe and protecting the United States is not done with Russian sign-off.\xc2\xa0 We have a -- for many years, a missile defense shield for Europe and for the United States was a theoretical exercise.\xc2\xa0 At Lisbon, it became a realistic missile defense shield for Europe and the United States based on a phased adaptive approach constructed by General Cartwright and others that make what we have always wanted a genuine reality. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat\'s -- again, that\'s not done with Russian sign-off.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the policy that our government thinks is best for our partners and allies in Europe and for the protection of the people of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And regarding the letter that the President sent to senators over the weekend on Saturday about -- enumerating or elaborating on the commitment to missile defense, to all four phases of missile defense, one response from a Republican was that, that\'s great that they\'re telling us, but had they also told the Russians.\xc2\xa0 Are the Russians aware that President Obama is committed to four phases of missile defense?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about how the President and the Vice President are still providing up-to-date information I guess to lawmakers who have questions or concern about START.\xc2\xa0 Why did so much of this -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s START or DADT or the tax cuts -- end up being in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, getting all of this done, all of this jammed into this short period of time?\xc2\xa0 What happened that led to this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t -- \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s been argued for 17 years, so I don\'t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure anybody has -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure anything -- maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re an Eagles fan, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a different fourth quarter analogy that -- I don\'t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of getting it done -- I\xe2\x80\x99m saying in terms -- there\xe2\x80\x99s so much that has --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A few people got that.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not an Eagles fan, but the fact that so much is trying to get crammed into --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 Patriots.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Giants fans on this side --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact that so much has been --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Patriots -- where are you from?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New England.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, just wanted to make sure --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not from there but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not from there --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Long story.\xc2\xa0 I lived there.\xc2\xa0 A complicated story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 We digress.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not going to be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We digress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go on and tell us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why did it come down to this, where so much was trying to get done in this short period of time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I guess I don\'t understand.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you mentioned the tax agreement.\xc2\xa0 The tax agreement, we -- there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a resolution to it before Congress left for the elections.\xc2\xa0 The START treaty didn\'t get a vote before we left for the elections.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\'t -- maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not totally understanding the point that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get me to respond to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll move on from there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel -- the fact that going into -- after the election, there were so many questions raised about whether or not the President could get all of these things that he wanted to get done, done before the end of the year --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not just all -- I think any.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or any of them.\xc2\xa0 And I think Jake wished you good luck when you ticked off all the various items.\xc2\xa0 What is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And an Eagles fan.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s sense now as he sits back --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two of them have been defeated, for the record. (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact that he was able to get --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You should see the email the President sent Jake.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that he was able to get the tax deal and the fact that he was able to get DADT, and you seem very confident about START, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s feeling now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think first and foremost, the President believed that each of these things -- and I will say this, too -- the President believes strongly and is disappointed greatly that we have yet to get the DREAM Act passed.\xc2\xa0 But I think in each of the instances that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the tax agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and what I believe will be passage and ratification of START, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see strong bipartisan majorities in support of issues that are important to the American people -- reducing the threat of nuclear weapons, reducing -- ensuring that taxes for middle-class families don\xe2\x80\x99t go up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI mean, I think there is a lesson of the importance that these issues have with not just those on Capitol Hill but with the American people, and that two parties can and should work together to get things like that done, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in December of the end of a two-year Congress or in January, the first month of a two-year Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President expressing any sort of sense of vindication that you would say looked to sort of defy some of his critics?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 You know, again, he is focused on getting our remaining priorities finished before the end of this session.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, as a former Eagles fan, are you suggesting -- (laughter) -- are you suggesting that getting START through the Senate is a bit like scoring four touchdowns in seven minutes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I was not understanding the fourth quarter analogy that Mr. Lothian was making.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does Congress and the President and Washington generally act like a college kid and wait until the last minute to get everything done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think when you do your two-year retrospectives you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that we got a lot done prior to the end of this session.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But all the papers are being handed in at the very last second right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t agree?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished in the last two or three weeks.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the notion that somehow all of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished in the last two years has been done in the last two or three weeks is to forget a lot of things that got accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing today?\xc2\xa0 Is he still working --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m a Cowboys fan and I\xe2\x80\x99m not rooting for the Eagles, just for the record.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President still --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Anybody a Redskins fan here?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, this is Washington.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is the President working the phones today --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and does he believe he\xe2\x80\x99s actually changed minds on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the President has made calls, and made calls over the weekend on START, on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the DREAM Act; that actually goes back more than just the past weekend.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President believes that -- obviously that he can make a set of arguments around those issues that are why they\xe2\x80\x99re important for our country to get them done now.\xc2\xa0 And obviously if there -- as I said earlier, as it relates to START or other things, if there are issues in which people have questions, we are certainly happy to provide answers either through the President or the President could have other people call them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any Republicans he has spoken to who at the end of the call have said, okay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got my vote?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that but we may share that at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say who he is calling on START today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Senators.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re sending us a hint, though, that he has actually changed some minds.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not as dumb as I look.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Senators.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 On the question of whether this is -- whether the Republican motivation here is political, how do you respond to Lindsey Graham\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the entire lame duck has been poisoned, and did that suggest to you that he has a political motivation for opposing this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Opposing START?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think each person should make up their mind and base their vote on the merits of each of the individual issues, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the tax agreement as we spent a couple of weeks debating, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the ratification of the START treaty -- all of which I think you can see there are enormously compelling arguments for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously, the tax agreement preserved tax rates for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t ask, don\'t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here on a number of occasions -- and I think very importantly the argument that you heard from the Joint Chiefs and from the Secretary of Defense, which is the notion that either Congress or the courts, one of those two institutions was going to overturn this policy.\xc2\xa0 And the question about how it was going to be overturned and the implementation of that new policy was very much determined by who overturned it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President and the Secretary of Defense and the Chair of the Joint Chiefs believe that doing that through a legislative body, rather than through a court, was an enormously important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd as it relates to the START treaty, you have the secretaries of state -- the last five for the last five -- the last five secretaries of state for Republican Presidents who have come out in favor of this, people across the political spectrum who believe this is simply the right thing to do. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo our hope is that everybody will make the determinations on each of these -- on each of their votes on each of these issues individually and on the merits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To continue this football metaphor -- (laughter) -- do you think the Republicans are basically trying to run out the clock until they have more members of the Senate next year to deal with START?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is a -- I don\'t think they -- START is going to be voted on before Congress leaves town.\xc2\xa0 And this is a treaty that has -- that was negotiated over the course of many months, signed in April in Prague by the two Presidents, and up for review and inspection since then -- not to mention the debate that has been had on the floor exceeds the time of debate for many treaties in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPlus, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little vexing to figure out how somebody can say in largely the same breath that they\'re concerned about what the preamble does to missile defense, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had enough time to look at the treaty.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s either one or the other, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be both.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a ton of sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think that -- again, I think because of the importance of getting this done, the importance to our foreign policy and to reducing the number of deployed nuclear weapons that each of these two countries has pointed at each other, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get this done now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See the President on Air Force One after a Wednesday signing ceremony?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s Wednesday or Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Sometime around then is my guess.\xc2\xa0 But I would not at this point harbor to make that any more specific than probably one of those two days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he likely -- will we be able to see him before he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is entirely possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No football metaphors.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You seem to be stopping short of saying that the Republican opposition on START is political, and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re also saying that all substantive objections have been met with an answer.\xc2\xa0 So if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s political, why not come right out and say it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no -- look, there can be substantive disagreements.\xc2\xa0 My point is simply that if I had a question about our posture on -- or the impact of any language on START, the person that I would want to talk to would be the person in charge of missile defense for the United States.\xc2\xa0 In that case, that\'s -- the preeminent expert on that in the Joint Chiefs is General Cartwright, and I think he was powerful on -- and has been for many months -- on what the language in the preamble does and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You deny this notion that Republicans just want to deny the President a victory?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, that\'s for them to decide what their opposition is.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an incongruence with some that have said that they oppose the treaty because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had enough time to debate it, which I don\'t think is matched by the facts of either how long -- how many hearings have been had, how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been on the Internet, how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been debated on the floor. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThose are the same people that are making the arguments also that -- even in some of the same statements -- that they have concerns about missile defense.\xc2\xa0 And it appears incongruent to me as to how one could determine if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had enough time, how they\xe2\x80\x99ve determined that missile defense is the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, why did the President not come out on camera on Saturday after the vote to repeal \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He I think was busy probably in the Oval Office working on calls on START.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare five minutes?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I just wonder if there was any sensitivity to Republican concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and also in the context of START.\xc2\xa0 Was that any reason why he didn\'t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, as I said earlier, I think -- and the President believes that individuals -- senators should make determinations on the issues and the merits of those issues alone and not -- not as a group of issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans like Senator Corker have suggested -- have proposed creating a date-certain, early next year, say, in February, for a START vote and said that that would satisfy a lot of the griping about process and the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jonathan, the time that has been allotted to debate this treaty exceeds the most previous treaties that have been on the floor of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been something that\'s been up on the Internet for eight months.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of credence to the arguments that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough time to get this done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given their anger about lame duck consideration and the danger of having a treaty rejected on the Senate floor, are you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be rejected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the President making phone calls.\xc2\xa0 Can you say if there are any other efforts being mustered from the White House, perhaps from Department of Defense, from General Cartwright again or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check in and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send that around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, on the CR, are you guys seeking -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a short-term CR, are you going to be seeking money for implementation of health care and Wall Street reform in that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from Legislative Affairs on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when you answered Wendell, were you answering in the idea of a news conference this week before he leaves?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 Did he cancel plans to go to the Wizards-Heat game on Saturday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He was -- he spent most of Saturday in the Oval working, and continued to do so in the evening in the residence and thought it was -- despite being a really good game -- a better use of his time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned that the Census report shows a very significant population shift from Democratic-leaning, Rust-Belt states to Republican-leaning, Sun-Belt states?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern about how this will affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection?\xc2\xa0 You stand to, with the Northeast and the Midwest, lose --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the exact numbers, but I think the electoral vote shift is -- I heard somebody say, six, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they could lose up to 10 seats in Congress, the Midwest and the Northeast.\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me -- I guess let me rephrase my question.\xc2\xa0 Are you looking for the congressional impact or are you looking for the presidential electoral impact?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, the Census determines -- the Census based on obvious population shifts determines reapportionment and representation in Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that somehow -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s six electoral votes that would have been different in 2008 if the same states were won in 2012 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mark a dramatic shift that would be anything that anybody would be even remotely fearful of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even 10 seats in Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit like worrying about the weather.\xc2\xa0 Again, the Census determines -- where people live determines that number of seats that represent them.\xc2\xa0 That is -- that\'s the way the law is written, and I would say I don\'t think that shifting some seats from one area of the country to another necessarily marks a concern that you can\xe2\x80\x99t make a politically potent argument in those new places.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did North Korea restrain itself more than or less than the White House expected?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99ll say on the exercises by the Republic of Korea is that they are our strong allies and we support them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the failure of the DREAM Act affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to bring up broader immigration reform next year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impact that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President, as I said earlier, is disappointed that this was a piece of legislation with bipartisan support and with more than a majority.\xc2\xa0 But because of Senate rules is not something that will be passed in this Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he still think something broader is achievable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is because we have to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 We have seen the legal effect of states trying to write their own immigration laws -- that the courts don\'t find that compelling.\xc2\xa0 They find that appropriately -- the appropriate venue for that to be the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve the many vexing issues out of immigration is to deal with it at a federal level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also does the President have a view on whether and how same-sex spouses of LGBT service members should be recognized by the military?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there are a series of implementation issues that will be tackled as a result of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up just I asked about the same thing?\xc2\xa0 Who is tackling these issues?\xc2\xa0 Is it just the Pentagon or is it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- as I said -- I think my answer -- I said these issues are being looked at by lawyers in Pentagon, Justice -- some lawyers here, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a task force?\xc2\xa0 Is there an implementation --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jimmy Carter thinks America is ready for a gay President.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama think America is ready for a gay President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on the gay rights issue, the President said recently that \xe2\x80\x9cattitudes evolve, including mine\xe2\x80\x9d -- he was referring to gay marriage.\xc2\xa0 Is he laying the groundwork in some sense for taking a different position than he has in the past on gay marriage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sheryl, I don\'t -- I would -- I think we had a fairly extensive conversation about this around -- in the transcript around that interview and I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would say this:\xc2\xa0 I think the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d is a significant accomplishment for many that had sought for more than a decade to repeal a policy that they, like the President, believed was unjust.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow, so does the legal -- does the vote on Saturday make the President think in any way that the country is perhaps more ready for gay marriage, or for a gay president, for that matter?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have not talked to him about the -- how the vote on Saturday impacts that.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- I think if you -- I mean, clearly if you look at -- on the issue of repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d there is clearly a shift in voter attitude, was broad bipartisan support in public polling for the repeal of a policy that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense, and on Wednesday it will no longer be the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mean to tell me that nobody talked to the President here about Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s comments?\xc2\xa0 Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean to tell you that nobody that I know of has talked to the President about Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Merry Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Happy New Year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have just two questions.\xc2\xa0 The Center for Immigration Studies reports that in 2008 and 2009, 2.4 million immigrants, legal and illegal, arrived while U.S. citizens were losing 8.6 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the question:\xc2\xa0 Why are we importing a million workers a year when 17 million Americans can\xe2\x80\x99t find work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Lester, as you point out, we have a policy problem that has to be dealt with through comprehensive immigration reform, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question:\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson wrote -- and this is a quote, and it\xe2\x80\x99s his quote, not mine -- \xe2\x80\x9cPress Secretary Robert Gibbs picks fights with both conservative talk radio hosts and \xe2\x80\x98the professional left,\xe2\x80\x99 which uniformly backfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you believe Gerson is wrong?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think maybe I should try out for speechwriter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re clever.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the CR -- on the CR, Republicans not only don\xe2\x80\x99t want any new spending, they want to go back to 2008 pre-Obama levels.\xc2\xa0 Is that a dealbreaker for the President?\xc2\xa0 Is that totally unacceptable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that -- to make sure I understand -- not that the 2008 levels are in the current CR, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, look --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They want to go back before that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the -- not surprisingly, we would have grave concerns, if you look at some of the aspects of what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Making some huge cuts in things like education at a time in which we have real competitiveness issues in this country and throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 Now is not the time to do some of those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously we have to make some and are going to have to make some very tough decisions to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President outlined a three-year spending freeze on non-security items in the budget.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make some of those tough decisions, and I think over the course of the next couple years we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a debate about -- a further debate about, for instance, tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, which comprise a level of funding greatly in excess of the difference between 2008 levels in spending and the CR.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, questions on two terrorist events.\xc2\xa0 The stabbing of the two women Christian missionaries in Israel -- is the U.S. involved in looking into that situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On that I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.\xc2\xa0 I would point you over to the State Department on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Statement of condemnation or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics of it.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you over to State on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The roundup of suspected terrorists in the United Kingdom, anything on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have -- obviously we are in constant contact with our allies in the United Kingdom and have -- we do not know of any connection with something that might be going on here as it relates to those arrests, but we continue on a daily basis to communicate with and share information between these two governments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGlenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, my assumption is Governor Richardson is not choosing Pyongyang as a vacation spot.\xc2\xa0 He cleared his trip with the State Department before he went.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to give sort of a debriefing on his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that -- I know of no plans to do that.\xc2\xa0 Again, Governor Richardson is traveling as a private citizen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did he have any -- he cleared this with the State Department before he went.\xc2\xa0 Did the State Department --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On some of the START calls, are you getting -- are you speaking with some -- any reluctant Democrats or is it mostly Republicans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made calls to both parties, but I would say that most of his focus is on Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how many --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I -- you know, I do not know -- I know that also the Vice President has been tasked to do a number of -- head up the passage of START, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who -- all who he\xe2\x80\x99s been calling, but I assume a lot of it is Republicans too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, apart from General Cartwright, the President and the Vice President, what other administration officials have sort of been conferring with the senators?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On START?\xc2\xa0 I know that on certain occasions, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, Director Clapper has answered questions on these.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Gates has been involved in this.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State has been involved in this.\xc2\xa0 This is a priority that -- of not just the President\xe2\x80\x99s, but of all those that have equities in our country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he prevailed upon any of the former secretaries of state and national security advisors to make calls?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They have -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told they have -- they were making calls before the President and Vice President met with them.\xc2\xa0 And I understand it, they continue to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President unhappy with Governor Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s trip?\xc2\xa0 Did he ask him not to go?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel it\xe2\x80\x99s counterproductive?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into his trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d you mentioned the implementation process that is underway.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a provision in the law that states that repeal won\xe2\x80\x99t take effect until the President, the Defense Secretary, and the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certifies the U.S. military is ready for repeal.\xc2\xa0 During this interim period, is the administration at all open to the possibility of issuing some kind of executive order to stop further discharges until repeal takes effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said earlier in this session, there are a host of implementation and legal issues that are being studied throughout the government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what do you say to a service member who is discharged under \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d between now and the time that repeal actually takes effect?\xc2\xa0 What would you say to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 By the time it\xe2\x80\x99s signed into law or when it takes effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The time between then and the discharges stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there are -- I would say to that person right now that there a host of lawyers looking at all of these legal issues.\xc2\xa0 But I would also say to that person that when the President walks into -- the President will sign into law the repeal of that policy on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question on this topic really quick.\xc2\xa0 How long do you anticipate it will take until that certification takes place?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, that is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that is part of what groups of people are going to be working on.\xc2\xa0 But I would say this.\xc2\xa0 We know that because of the attitudinal studies that the Pentagon conducted, we know that the vast majority of those serving in our military don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this in any way will be disruptive.\xc2\xa0 And I think that points to an implementation process that won\xe2\x80\x99t be overly burdensome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Going back to START, I\'d like you to address one of the concerns that\xe2\x80\x99s been raised in the twilight hours of the debate on it, and that is, were the Russians to pull out of the START agreement over missile defense, would the U.S. still proceed, in Senator Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s words, within the parameters of START?\xc2\xa0 Would they still honor their side of the agreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from Cartwright on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of tensions in Africa inside the Ivory Coast.\xc2\xa0 President Gbagbo (inaudible) after election laws.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House message to President Gbagbo?\xc2\xa0 And could you consider a military option with the French?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that, as it relates to the election in C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, that the -- President Outtara was the rightly and justly elected President, and that we stand ready to impose targeted sanctions individually and in concert with our partners around the world on President Gbagbo, on his immediate family, on those that are associated with him, and who continue -- those who continue to cling to power illegitimately.\xc2\xa0 That election was clear.\xc2\xa0 Its result was clear.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s time for him to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your response to critics of the 9/11 First Responders Bill who say the $7 billion contained therein has not been closely scrutinized enough and that it should wait until the next session of Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the administration endorsed the 9/11 bill in mid-August.\xc2\xa0 We put out a statement of administration policy before the House vote and we did so before the Senate vote.\xc2\xa0 I think there are plenty of safeguards to ensure that that money isn\xe2\x80\x99t abused.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that we ought to take care of those who took care of us.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why every Democrat in the Senate voted to move that legislation forward.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to why every Republican opposed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on START.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could talk a little bit about just how personal this issue is to the President.\xc2\xa0 I mean, nonproliferation has been a big issue of his going back to the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this -- clearly he wants this as part of his legacy as he\xe2\x80\x99s forming it.\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell me about -- a little bit about how personal it is?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously this is an issue that goes back to, as you mentioned, even before he was sworn in in the Senate, having conversations with Senator Lugar, who, I would point out, along with Senator Kerry, have been great champions of both this issue and this treaty.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would be where we are on getting it passed without both of those two leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think, though, the President is less concerned with his legacy and that sort of thing that he is with, first and foremost, the reduction of the risk, the -- both the risk of having too many weapons and the risk of those weapons falling into the hands of somebody that seeks to do great harm to millions of innocent victims.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important we have a verification regime.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important that we continue to have a productive relationship with Russia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this personal for the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s personal but it\xe2\x80\x99s far greater than that.\xc2\xa0 It is, as he and virtually every --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t(Cell phone rings.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who was that?\xc2\xa0 I just have to know who --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s usually on vibrate.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it got there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can change that, Mike.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the vibrate I meant -- you can change the ringtone.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only his son can do it.\xc2\xa0 Only his son can do it, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was going to say.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mike\xe2\x80\x99s son, please put it on something cool tomorrow and call him around this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNo, I think this is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s far greater -- of far greater importance to the nation and to the world than it is to him personally.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not important to him personally.\xc2\xa0 It just demonstrates just how important and vital this is for our relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bill, and I\'ll come back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you give us a quick readout on the labor meeting Friday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing, honestly, more than the written readout that would have gone out from that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the complaints that I heard from a couple of the presidents before they went in was that there were not clear lines of communication between the White House and the labor unions.\xc2\xa0 Was anything set up, a liaison or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear lines on that, but I will check and see if that was -- to what degree that was brought up and discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Vice President Biden said that U.S. troops will be out of Afghanistan by 2014, \xe2\x80\x9ccome hell or high water.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that U.S. policy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would point you to what was decided in Lisbon just a few weeks ago, that we will, much like we have in Iraq, transfer primary security of Afghanistan to the Afghans, as NATO and ISAF agreed, by the end of 2014, which would end our combat commitment in that country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s different than being completely out, though, by 2014.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I think what the Vice President was discussing was our combat role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question on that.\xc2\xa0 He said also that the July 2011 withdrawal would not be a token withdrawal.\xc2\xa0 How does he know that, given that that -- the size of that withdrawal is supposed to be based on conditions on the ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It will be determined by conditions on the ground, but I think that the Vice President knows, as many do here, that the President made -- the President, in conjunction with the military, worked through a plan a year ago that they think is achievable to meet the date of July 2011. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt is -- there are many that believed that we would not meet our dates in Iraq, and we did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:28 P.M.
